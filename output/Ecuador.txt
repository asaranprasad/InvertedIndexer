that were gradually incorporated into the inca empire during the 15th century the territory was colonized by spain during the 16th century achieving independence in 1820 as part of gran colombia from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 the legacy of both empires is reflected in ecuador s ethnically diverse population with most of its 16.4 million people being mestizos followed by

future ecuador before the arrival of the incas the archeological evidence suggests that the paleo-indians first dispersal into the americas occurred near the end of the last glacial period around 16,500 13,000 years ago the first indians who reached ecuador may have journeyed by land from north and central america or by boat down the pacific ocean coastline much later migrations to ecuador may have come via the amazon tributaries others descended from northern south america and others ascended from the southern part of south america through the andes they developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups even though their languages were unrelated these groups developed similar groups of cultures each based in different environments the people of the coast developed a fishing hunting and gathering culture the people of the highland andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life and the people of the amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence over time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe with a similar language and culture many civilizations arose in ecuador such as the valdivia culture and machalilla culture on the coast the quitus near present-day quito and the ca ari near present-day cuenca each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture pottery and religious interests in the highland andes mountains where life was more sedentary groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed eventually through wars and marriage alliances of their leaders a group of nations formed confederations one region consolidated under a confederation called the shyris which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions its political and military power came under the rule of the duchicela blood-line inca era when the incas arrived they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the incas two generations of rulers topa inca yupanqui and huayna capac to absorb them into the inca empire the native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of peru bolivia and north argentina similarly a number of loyal inca subjects from peru and bolivia were brought to ecuador to prevent rebellion thus the region of highland ecuador became part of the inca empire in 1463 sharing the same language in contrast when the incas made incursions into coastal ecuador and the eastern amazon jungles of ecuador they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile moreover when the incas tried to subdue them these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to guerrilla tactics as a result inca expansion into the amazon basin and the pacific coast of ecuador was hampered the indigenous people of the amazon jungle and coastal ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force the amazonian people and the cayapas of coastal ecuador were the only groups to resist inca and spanish domination maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century before the arrival of the spaniards the inca empire was involved in a civil war the untimely death of both the heir ninan cuchi and the emperor huayna capac from a european disease that spread into ecuador created a power vacuum between two factions the northern faction headed by atahualpa claims that huayna capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided he gave the territories pertaining to present-day ecuador and northern peru to his favorite son atahualpa who was to rule from quito and he gave the rest to hu scar who was to rule from cuzco he willed that his heart be buried in quito his favorite city and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in cuzco hu scar did not recognize his father s will since it did not follow inca traditions of naming an inca through the priests hu scar ordered atahualpa to attend their father s burial in cuzco and pay homage to him as the new inca ruler atahualpa with a large number of his father s veteran soldiers decided to ignore hu scar and a civil war ensued a number of bloody battles took place until finally hu scar was captured atahualpa marched south to cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother a small band of spaniards headed by francisco pizarro landed in tumbez and marched over the andes mountains until they reached cajamarca where the new inca atahualpa was to hold an interview with them valverde the priest tried to convince atahualpa that he should join the catholic church and declare himself a vassal of spain this infuriated atahualpa so much that he threw the bible to the ground at this point the enraged spaniards with orders from valverde attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the inca and captured atahualpa pizarro promised to release atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold but after a mock trial the spaniards executed atahualpa by strangulation spanish rule new infectious diseases endemic to the europeans caused high fatalities among the amerindian population during the first decades of spanish rule as they had no immunity at the same time the natives were forced into the encomienda labor system for the spanish in 1563 quito became the seat of a real audiencia administrative district of spain and part of the viceroyalty of peru and later the viceroyalty of new granada after nearly 300 years of spanish rule quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants on august 10 1809 the city s criollos called for independence from spain first among the peoples of latin america they were led by juan p o mont far quiroga salinas and bishop cuero y caicedo quito s nickname luz de am rica light of america is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent local government although the new government lasted no more than two months it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of spanish america all brigantine the san pedro independence antonio jos de sucre on october 9 1820 guayaquil became the first city in ecuador to gain its independence from spain the people were very happy about the independence and celebrated which is now ecuador s independence day officially on may 24 1822 the rest of ecuador gained its independence after antonio jos de sucre defeated the spanish royalist forces at the battle of pichincha near quito following the battle ecuador joined sim n bol var s republic of gran colombia also including modern-day colombia venezuela and panama in 1830 ecuador separated from gran colombia and became an independent republic the 19th century was marked by instability for ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers the first president of ecuador was the venezuelan-born juan jos flores who was ultimately deposed followed by several authoritarian leaders such as vicente rocafuerte jos joaqu n de olmedo jos mar a urbina diego noboa pedro jos de arteta manuel de asc subi and flores s own son antonio flores jij n among others the conservative gabriel garcia moreno unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the roman catholic church in the late 19th century world demand for cocoa tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast ecuador abolished slavery and freed its black slaves in 1851 14 liberal revolution antique dug out canoes in the courtyard of the old military hospital in the historic center of quito the liberal revolution of 1895 under eloy alfaro reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners this liberal wing retained power until the military julian revolution of 1925 the 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians such as five-time president jos mar a velasco ibarra loss of claimed territories since 1830 president juan jos flores de jure territorial claims since ecuador s separation from colombia in may 13 1830 its first president general juan jos flores laid claim to the territory that was called the real audiencia of quito also referred to as the presidencia of quito he supported his claims with spanish royal decrees or real cedulas that delineated the borders of spain s former overseas colonies in the case of ecuador flores-based ecuador s de jure claims on the following cedulas - real cedula of 1563 1739 and 1740 with modifications in the amazon basin and andes mountains that were introduced through the treaty of guayaquil 1829 which peru reluctantly signed after the overwhelmingly outnumbered gran colombian force led by antonio jos de sucre defeated president and general la mar s peruvian invasion force in the battle of tarqui in addition ecuador s eastern border with the portuguese colony of brazil in the amazon basin was modified before the wars of independence by the first treaty of san ildefonso 1777 between the spanish empire and the portuguese empire moreover to add legitimacy to his claims on february 16 1840 flores signed a treaty with spain whereby flores convinced spain to officially recognize ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over spain s former colonial territory known anciently to spain as the kingdom and presidency of quito ecuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors such as colombia in 1832 and 1916 brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties and peru after a short war in which the protocol of rio de janeiro was signed in 1942 struggle for independence during the struggle for independence before peru or ecuador became independent nations a few areas of the former vice royalty of new granada - guayaquil tumbez and ja n - declared themselves independent from spain a few months later a part of the peruvian liberation army of san martin decided to occupy the independent cities of tumbez and ja n with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the audiencia de quito ecuador it was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader san martin wished to liberate present-day ecuador and add it to the future republic of peru since it had been part of the inca empire before the spaniards conquered it however bol var s intention was to form a new republic known as the gran colombia out of the liberated spanish territory of new granada which consisted of colombia venezuela and ecuador san martin s plans were thwarted when bol var with the help of marshal antonio jos de sucre and the gran colombian liberation force descended from the andes mountains and occupied guayaquil they also annexed the newly liberated audiencia de quito to the republic of gran colombia this happened a few days before san martin s peruvian forces could arrive and occupy guayaquil with the intention of annexing guayaquil to the rest of audiencia of quito ecuador and to the future republic of peru historic documents repeatedly stated that san martin told bolivar he came to guayaquil to liberate the land of the incas from spain bolivar countered by sending a message from guayaquil welcoming san martin and his troops to colombian soil peruvian occupation of ja n tumbes and guayaquil in the south ecuador had de jure claims to a small piece of land beside the pacific ocean known as tumbes which lay between the zarumilla and tumbes rivers in ecuador s southern andes mountain region where the mara on cuts across ecuador had de jure claims to an area it called ja n de bracamoros these areas were included as part of the territory of gran colombia by bolivar in december 17 1819 during the congress of angostura when the republic of gran colombia was created tumbes declared itself independent from spain on january 17 1821 and jaen de bracamoros on june 17 1821 without any outside help from revolutionary armies however that same year 1821 peruvian forces participating in the trujillo revolution occupied both jaen and tumbes some peruvian generals without any legal titles backing them up and with ecuador still federated with the gran colombia had the desire to annex ecuador to the republic of peru at the expense of the gran colombia feeling that ecuador was once part of the inca empire on july 28 1821 peruvian independence was proclaimed in lima by the liberator san martin and tumbes and jaen which were included as part of the revolution of trujillo by the peruvian occupying force had the whole region swear allegiance to the new peruvian flag and incorporated itself into peru even though peru was not completely liberated from spain after peru was completely liberated from spain by the patriot armies led by bolivar and antonio jose de sucre at the battle of ayacucho dated december 9 1824 there was a strong desire by some peruvians to resurrect the inca empire and to include bolivia and ecuador one of these peruvian generals was the ecuadorian-born jos de la mar who became one of peru s presidents after bolivar resigned as dictator of peru and returned to colombia gran colombia had always protested peru for the return of jaen and tumbes for almost a decade then finally bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of jaen tumbes and part of mainas declared war president and general jos de la mar who was born in ecuador believing his opportunity had come to annex the district of ecuador to peru personally with a peruvian force invaded and occupied guayaquil and a few cities in the loja region of southern ecuador on november 28 1828 the war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern gran colombian army at battle of tarqui dated february 27 1829 led by antonio jos de sucre defeated the peruvian invasion force led by president la mar this defeat led to the signing of the treaty of guayaquil dated september 22 1829 whereby peru and its congress recognized gran colombian rights over tumbes jaen and maynas through protocolized meetings between representatives of peru and gran colombia the border was set as tumbes river in the west and in the east the maranon and amazon rivers were to be followed toward brazil as the most natural borders between them however what was pending was whether the new border around the jaen region should follow the chinchipe river or the huancabamba river according to the peace negotiations peru agreed to return guayaquil tumbez and ja n despite this peru returned guayaquil but failed to return tumbes and ja n alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements since the gran colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - ecuador colombia and venezuela the dissolution of gran colombia the gran colombia showing all colombian land claims outlined in red ecuador in 1830 the central district of the gran colombia known as cundinamarca or new granada modern colombia with its capital in bogota did not recognize the separation of the southern district of the gran colombia with its capital in quito from the gran colombian federation on may 13 1830 after ecuador s separation the department of cauca voluntarily decided to unite itself with ecuador due to instability in the central government of bogota president juan jos flores with the approval of the ecuadorian congress annexed the department of cauca on december 20 1830 since the government of cauca had called for union with the district of the south as far back as april 1830 moreover the cauca region throughout its long history had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of ecuador also the cauca region which included such cities as pasto popay n and buenaventura had always been dependent on the presidencia or audiencia of quito fruitless negotiations continued between the governments of bogot and quito where the government of bogot did not recognize the separation of ecuador or that of cauca from the gran colombia until war broke out in may 1832 in five months new granada defeated ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the ecuadorian armed forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from venezuela and colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen seeing that his officers were rebelling mutinying and changing sides president flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with new granada the treaty of pasto of 1832 was signed by which the department of cauca was turned over to new granada modern colombia the government of bogot recognized ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the ley de divisi n territorial de la rep blica de colombia law of the division of territory of the gran colombia passed on june 25 1824 this law set the border at the river carchi and the eastern border that stretched to brazil at the caquet river later ecuador contended that the republic of colombia while reorganizing its government unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that colombia extended its claims south to the napo river because it said that the government of popay n extended its control all the way to the napo river struggle for possession of the amazon basin south america 1879 all land claims by peru ecuador colombia brazil argentina chile and bolivia in 1879 when ecuador seceded from the gran colombia peru decided not to follow the treaty of guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made peru contested ecuador s claims with the newly discovered real cedula of 1802 by which peru claims the king of spain had transferred these lands from the viceroyalty of new granada to the viceroyalty of peru during colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding portuguese settlements into spanish domains which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of jesuit missionaries from their bases along the amazon basin ecuador countered by labeling the cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument which had nothing to do with political borders peru began its de facto occupation of disputed amazonian territories after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of brazil this treaty disregarded spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a spanish-portuguese treaty over the amazon regarding territories held by illegal portuguese settlers peru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the mainas or maynas region which it began calling loreto with its capital in iquitos during its negotiations with brazil peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802 it claimed amazonian basin territories up to caqueta river in the north and toward the andes mountain range depriving ecuador and colombia of all their claims to the amazon basin colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the napo and amazon rivers ecuador protested that it claimed the amazon basin between the caqueta river and the mara on-amazon river peru ignored these protests and created the department of loreto in 1853 with its capital in iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both colombia and ecuador peru briefly occupied guayaquil again in 1860 since peru thought that ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to british bond holders but returned guayaquil after a few months the border dispute was then submitted to spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910 but to no avail in the early part of the 20th century ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation on may 6 1904 ecuador signed the tobar-rio branco treaty recognizing brazil s claims to the amazon in recognition of ecuador s claim to be an amazonian country to counter peru s earlier treaty with brazil back in october 23 1851 then after a few meetings with the colombian government s representatives an agreement was reached and the mu oz vernaza-suarez treaty was signed july 15 1916 in which colombian rights to the putumayo river were recognized as well as ecuador s rights to the napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers in this way ecuador gave up the claims it had to the amazonian territories between the caquet river and napo river to colombia thus cutting itself off from brazil later a brief war erupted between colombia and peru over peru s claims to the caquet region which ended with the peru reluctantly signing the salomon-lozano treaty on march 24 1922 ecuador protested this secret treaty since colombia gave away ecuadorian claimed land to peru that ecuador had given to colombia in 1916 in july 21 1924 the ponce-castro oyanguren protocol was signed between ecuador and peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the united states for arbitration negotiations between the ecuadorian and peruvian representatives began in washington on september 30 1935 these negotiations were long and tiresome both sides logically presented their cases but no one seemed to give up their claims then on february 6 1937 ecuador presented a transactional line which peru rejected the next day the negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on september 29 1937 the peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere four years later in 1941 amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the zarumilla river war broke out with peru peru claimed that ecuador s military presence in peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion ecuador for its part claimed that peru had recently invaded ecuador around the zarumilla river and that peru since ecuador s independence from spain has systematically occupied tumbez jaen and most of the disputed territories in the amazonian basin between the putomayo and mara on rivers in july 1941 troops were mobilized in both countries peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed ecuadorian force of 2,300 of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces hostilities erupted on july 5 1941 when peruvian forces crossed the zarumilla river at several locations testing the strength and resolve of the ecuadorian border troops finally on july 23 1941 the peruvians launched a major invasion crossing the zarumilla river in force and advancing into the ecuadorian province of el oro map of ecuadorian land claims after 1916 during the course of the ecuadorian peruvian war peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of el oro and some parts of the province of loja demanding that the ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims the peruvian navy blocked the port of guayaquil almost cutting all supplies to the ecuadorian troops after a few weeks of war and under pressure by the united states and several latin american nations all fighting came to a stop ecuador and peru came to an accord formalized in the rio protocol signed on january 29 1942 in favor of hemispheric unity against the axis powers in world war ii favouring peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end the 1944 glorious may revolution followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed carlos arroyo del r o as a dictator from ecuador s government however a post-second world war recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s while foreign companies developed oil resources in the ecuadorian amazon in 1972 construction of the andean pipeline was completed the pipeline brought oil from the east side of the andes to the coast making ecuador south america s second largest oil exporter the pipeline in southern ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between ecuador and peru however ecuadorian troops during the cenepa war the mirage f.1ja fae-806 was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two peruvian sukhoi su-22 on february 10 1995 the rio protocol failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote cordillera del c ndor region in southern ecuador this caused a long-simmering dispute between ecuador and peru which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries first a border skirmish in january february 1981 known as the paquisha incident and ultimately full-scale warfare in january 1995 where the ecuadorian military shot down peruvian aircraft and helicopters and peruvian infantry marched into southern ecuador each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities known as the cenepa war sixto dur n ball n the ecuadorian president famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of ecuador popular sentiment in ecuador became strongly nationalistic against peru graffiti could be seen on the walls of quito referring to peru as the cain de latinoam rica a reference to the murder of abel by his brother cain in the book of genesis 15 ecuador and peru signed the brasilia presidential act peace agreement on october 26 1998 which ended hostilities and effectively put an end to the western hemisphere s longest running territorial dispute 16 the guarantors of the rio protocol argentina brazil chile and the united states of america ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the cordillera del c ndor while ecuador had to give up its decades-old territorial claims to the eastern slopes of the cordillera as well as to the entire western area of cenepa headwaters peru was compelled to give to ecuador in perpetual lease but without sovereignty 1 km2 of its territory in the area where the ecuadorian base of tiwinza focal point of the war had been located within peruvian soil and which the ecuadorian army held during the conflict the final border demarcation came into effect on may 13 1999 and the multi-national momep military observer mission for ecuador and peru troop deployment withdrew on june 17 1999 16 military governments 1972 79 in 1972 a revolutionary and nationalist military junta overthrew the government of velasco ibarra the coup d tat was led by general guillermo rodr guez and executed by navy commander jorge queirolo g the new president exiled jos mar a velasco to argentina he remained in power until 1976 when he was removed by another military government that military junta was led by admiral alfredo poveda who was declared chairman of the supreme council the supreme council included two other members general guillermo dur n arcentales and general luis leoro franco the civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections colonel richelieu levoyer government minister proposed and implemented a plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections this plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office return to democracy elections were held on april 29 1979 under a new constitution jaime rold s aguilera was elected president garnering over one million votes the most in ecuadorian history he took office on august 10 as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships in 1980 he founded the partido pueblo cambio y democracia people change and democracy party after withdrawing from the concentraci n de fuerzas populares popular forces concentration and governed until may 24 1981 when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense marco subia martinez when his air force plane crashed in heavy rain near the peruvian border many people believe that he was assassinated by the cia citation needed given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident roldos was immediately succeeded by vice president osvaldo hurtado who was followed in 1984 by le n febres cordero from the social christian party rodrigo borja cevallos of the democratic left izquierda democr tica or id party won the presidency in 1988 running in the runoff election against abdal bucaram brother in law of jaime roldos and founder of the ecuadorian roldosist party his government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms notably an opening of ecuador to foreign trade the borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group alfaro vive carajo alfaro lives dammit named after eloy alfaro however continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the id and opposition parties gained control of congress in 1999 the emergence of the amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years the population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform lower unemployment and provision of social services and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite their movement along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements has led to a deterioration of the executive office the populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital as illustrated by the most recent removal of president lucio guti rrez from office by congress in april 2005 vice president alfredo palacio took his place and remained in office until the presidential election of 2006 in which rafael correa gained the presidency 17 in december 2008 president correa declared ecuador s national debt illegitimate based on the argument that it was odious debt contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regimes he announced that the country would default on over 3 billion worth of bonds he then pledged to fight creditors in international courts and succeeded in reducing the price of outstanding bonds by more than 60 18 he brought ecuador into the bolivarian alliance for the americas in june 2009 to date correa s administration has succeeded in reducing the high levels of poverty and unemployment in ecuador 19 20 21 22 23 government and politics the

stationed in ecuador due to border disputes with peru which claimed territories under its political control when it was a spanish vice-royalty once gran colombia was dissolved after the death of sim n bol var in 1830 ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force so influential was the military in ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of general juan jose flores first president of ecuador of venezuelan origin general jose ma urbina and general robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period due to the continuous border disputes with peru finally settled in the early 2000s and due to the ongoing problem with the colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating amazonian provinces the ecuadorian armed forces has gone through a series of changes in 2009 the new administration at the defense ministry launched a deep

fertile and productive land and is the seat of the large banana exportation plantations of the companies dole and chiquita this region is also where most of ecuador s rice crop is grown the truly coastal provinces have active fisheries the largest coastal city is guayaquil la sierra or the highlands the sierra consists of the andean and interandean highland provinces azuay ca ar carchi chimborazo imbabura loja pichincha and tungurahua this land contains most of ecuador s volcanoes and all of its snow-capped peaks agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of potato maize and quinua and the population is predominantly amerindian kichua the largest sierran city is quito la amazon a also known as el oriente or the east the oriente consists of the amazon jungle provinces morona santiago napo orellana pastaza sucumb os and zamora-chinchipe this region is primarily made up of the huge amazon national parks and amerindian untouchable zones which are vast stretches of land set aside for the amazon amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally it is also the area with the largest reserves of petroleum in ecuador and parts of the upper amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies the population is primarily mixed amerindian shuar huaorani and kichua although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted the

determined by altitude it is mild year-round in the mountain valleys with a humid subtropical climate in coastal areas and rainforest in lowlands the pacific coastal area has a tropical climate with a severe rainy season the climate in the andean highlands is temperate and relatively dry and the amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones because of its location at the equator ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o clock hours 1 hydrology pastaza river the andes is the watershed divisor between the amazon watershed which runs to the east and the pacific including the north south rivers mataje santiago esmeraldas chone guayas jubones and puyango-tumbes almost all of the rivers in ecuador form in the la sierra region and flow east toward the amazon river or west toward the pacific ocean the rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations in the la sierra region the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the andes to the lower elevations of the other regions the highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the costa and the oriente in the costa the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from december through may and become empty riverbeds during the dry season the few exceptions are the longer perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and la sierra on their way to the pacific ocean the internal coast by contrast is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season sometimes forming swamps major rivers in the oriente include the pastaza napo and putumayo the pastaza is formed by the confluence of the chambo and the patate rivers both of which rise in the sierra the pastaza includes the agoyan waterfall which at sixty-one meters 200 feet is the highest waterfall in ecuador the napo rises near mount cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands the napo ranges in width from 500 to 1,800 m 1,600 to 5,900 ft in its upper reaches the napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries the coca river where it slows and levels off the putumayo forms part of the border with colombia all of these rivers flow into the amazon river the gal pagos islands have no significant rivers several of the larger islands however have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the pacific ocean biodiversity turtles and dryas iulia ecuador ecuador is one of seventeen megadiverse countries in the world according to conservation international 11 and it has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation 38 39

to truly preserve the nation s biodiversity 38 current protected areas include 11 national parks 10 wildlife refuges 9 ecological reserves and other areas 43 a program begun in 2008 sociobosque is preserving another 2.3 of total land area 6,295 km or 629,500 ha by paying private landowners or community landowners such as amerindian tribes incentives to maintain their land as native ecosystems such as native forests or grasslands eligibility and subsidy rates for this program are determined based on the poverty in the region the number of hectares that will be protected and the type of ecosystem of the land to be protected among other factors 44 despite being on the unesco list the gal pagos are endangered by a range of negative environmental effects threatening the existence of this exotic ecosystem 45 additionally oil exploitation of the amazon rainforest has led to the release of billions of gallons of untreated wastes gas and crude oil into the environment contaminating ecosystems and causing detrimental health effects to amerindian peoples 46 economy tree map of products exported by ecuador in the hs4 product classification ecuador has a developing economy that is

population 57 this is explained to an extent by emigration and the economic stability achieved after adopting the u s dollar as official means of transaction however starting in 2008 with the bad economic performance of the nations where most ecuadorian emigrants work the reduction of poverty has been realized through social spending mainly in education and health 58 refineries in esmeraldas

north american expatriates 87 they re drawn there by the authentic cultural experience and beautiful natural surroundings also ecuador s favorable residency options make for an easy transition for those who decide to settle there indefinitely another perk that draws many expats to ecuador is its low cost of living since everything from gas to groceries costs far less than in north america it s a popular choice for those who are looking to make the most of their retirement budget even real estate in ecuador is much less than its tropical counterparts however as more and more north americans

in ecuadorian garment participating in the 2010 carnaval del pueblo ecuador s mainstream culture is defined by its hispanic mestizo majority and like their ancestry it is traditionally of spanish heritage influenced in different degrees by amerindian traditions and in some cases by african elements the first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to ecuador consisted of spanish colonists following the arrival of europeans in 1499 a lower number of other europeans and north americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and in smaller numbers

artisan market since african slavery was not the workforce of the spanish colonies in the andes mountains given the subjugation of the amerindian people through proselytization and encomiendas the minority population of african descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of esmeraldas this is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of ecuador the few black african survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of anton the chief of the group where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the andean region a little later runaway slaves from colombia known as cimarrones joined them

blica del ecuador is the responsible entity of the regulation and creation of the public health policies and health care plans the minister of public health is appointed directly by the president of the republic the current minister or ecuadorian general surgeon is margarita guevara the philosophy of the ministry of public health is the social support and service to the most vulnerable population 100 and its main plan of action lies around communitarian health and preventive medicine 100 the public healthcare system allows patients to be treated without an appointment in public general hospitals by general practitioners and specialists in the outpatient clinic consulta externa at no cost this is done in the four basic specialties of pediatric gynecology clinic medicine and surgery 101 there are also public hospitals specialized to treat chronic diseases target a particular group of the population or provide better treatment in some medical specialties some examples in this group are the gynecologic hospitals or maternities children hospitals geriatric hospitals and oncology institutes although well-equipped general hospitals are found in the major cities or capitals of provinces there are basic hospitals in the smaller towns and canton cities for family care consultation and treatments in pediatrics gynecology clinical medicine and surgery 101 community health care centers centros de salud are found inside metropolitan areas of cities and in rural areas these are day hospitals that provide treatment to patients whose hospitalization is under 24 hours 101 the doctors assigned to rural communities where the amerindian population can be substantial have small clinics under their responsibility for the treatment of patients in the same fashion as the day hospitals in the major cities the treatment in this case respects the culture of the community 101 the public healthcare system should not be confused with the ecuadorian social security healthcare service which is dedicated to individuals with formal employment and who are affiliated obligatorily through their employers citizens with no formal employment may still contribute to the social security system voluntarily and have access to the medical services rendered by the social security system the ecuadorian institute of social security iess has several major hospitals and medical sub-centers under its administration across the nation 102 ecuador currently ranks 20 in most efficient health care countries compared to 111 back in the year 2000 103 ecuadorians have a life

health care including doctor s visits basic surgeries and basic medications has been provided free since 2008 105 however some public hospitals are in poor condition and often lack necessary supplies to attend the high demand of patients private hospitals and clinics are well equipped but still expensive for the majority of the population education espol guayaquil the oldest observatory in south america is the quito astronomical observatory founded in 1873 and located in quito ecuador the quito astronomical observatory is managed by epn 108 the ecuadorian constitution requires that all children attend school until they achieve a basic level of education which is estimated at nine school years 109 in 1996 the net primary enrollment rate was 96.9 and 71.8 of children stayed in school until the fifth grade 109 the cost of primary and secondary education is borne by the government but families often face significant additional expenses such as fees and transportation costs 109

areas only 10 of the children go on to high school citation needed the ministry of education states that the mean number of years completed is 6.7 citation needed maldonado s high school riobamba ecuador has 61 universities many of which still confer terminal degrees according to the traditional spanish education system 110 honoring a long tradition of having some of the oldest universities in the americas university of san fulgencio founded in 1586 by the augustines san gregorio magno university founded in 1651 by the jesuits and university of santo tom s of aquino founded in 1681 by the dominican order among the traditional conferred terminal degrees can be noted the doctorate for medicine and law schools or engineering physics chemistry or mathematics for polytechnic or technology institutes these terminal degrees as in the case of the phd in other countries were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher in the professional realm a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual however in 2004 the national council of higher education conesup started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts the new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects credits or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas the terminal degree in law previously known as jd juris doctor doctor en jurisprudencia was replaced by the one of abogado attorney with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree in the same fashion for medical school the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years the minimum needed to obtain the title of md in medicine and surgery to almost five with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore and it is given with the title of m dico medic therefore an md or phd in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts nonetheless a m dico can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician biblioteca municipal de guayaquil this new reorganization although very ambitious lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions one of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians as today a master s degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign phd to attain or retain the status of rector president of a university or d cano dean for ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country these regulations sounded illogical disappointing and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement a debate to modify this and other reforms especially the one which granted control of the higher education system by the government was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan national assembly on august 4 2010 but vetoed by president rafael correa who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and senplades national secretary of planning and development due to this change there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87 of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master s degree and fewer than 5 have a phd although many of them already have ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees about 300 institutes of
