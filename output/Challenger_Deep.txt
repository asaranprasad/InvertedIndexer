https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_Deep challenger deep from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search location of challenger deep within the mariana trench and western pacific ocean the challenger deep is the deepest known point in the earth s seabed hydrosphere with a depth of 10,898 to 10,916 m 35,755 to 35,814 ft by direct measurement from submersibles and slightly more by sonar bathymetry it is in the pacific ocean at the southern end of the mariana trench near the mariana islands group the challenger deep is a relatively small slot-shaped depression in the bottom of a considerably larger crescent-shaped oceanic trench which itself is an unusually deep feature in the ocean floor its bottom is about 11 km 7 mi long and 1.6 km 1 mi wide with gently sloping sides 1 the closest land to the challenger deep is fais island one of the outer islands of yap 287 km 178 mi southwest and guam 304 km 189 mi to the northeast it is located in the ocean territory of the federated states of micronesia 1.6 km 1 mi from its border with ocean territory associated with guam 2 the depression is named after the british royal navy survey ship hms challenger whose expedition of 1872 1876 made the first recordings of its depth according to the august 2011 version of the gebco gazetteer of undersea feature names the location and depth of the challenger deep are and 10,920 m 35,827 ft 10 m 33 ft 3 june 2009 sonar mapping of the challenger deep by the simrad em120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for 300 11,000 m deep water mapping aboard the rv kilo moana indicated a depth of 10,971 metres 35,994 ft the sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection with a precision of 0.2 to 0.5 of water depth this is an error of about 22 to 55 m 72 to 180 ft at this depth 4 5 6 further soundings made by the us center for coastal ocean mapping in october 2010 are in agreement with this figure preliminarily placing the deepest part of the challenger deep at 10,994 m 36,070 ft with an estimated vertical uncertainty of 40 m 131 ft 7 8 a 2014 study concludes that with the best of 2010 multibeam echosounder technologies a depth uncertainty of 25 m 82 ft 95 confidence level on 9 degrees of freedom and a positional uncertainty of 20 to 25 m 66 to 82 ft 2drms remain and the location of the deepest depth recorded in the 2010 mapping is 10,984 m 36,037 ft at 6 only four descents have ever been achieved the first descent by any vehicle was by the manned bathyscaphe trieste in 1960 this was followed by the unmanned rovs kaik in 1995 and nereus in 2009 in march 2012 a manned solo descent was made by the deep-submergence vehicle deepsea challenger 9 10 11 these expeditions measured very similar depths of 10,898 to 10,916 metres 35,755 to 35,814 ft

different vessels 12 the hms challenger expedition december 1872 may 1876 first sounded the depths now known as the challenger deep this first sounding was made on 23 march 1875 at station 225 13 the reported depth was 4,475 fathoms 26,850 ft 8,184 m at based on two separate soundings a 1912 book the depths of the ocean by sir john murray records the depth of the challenger deep as 31,614 ft 9,636 m reporting the sounding taken by the converted navy collier uss nero in 1899 14 murray was one of the expedition scientists 15 in 1951 about 75 years after its original discovery the entire mariana trench was surveyed by a second royal navy vessel captained by george stephen ritchie later rear admiral ritchie this vessel was also named hms challenger after the original expedition ship this survey recorded the deepest part of the trench using echo sounding a more precise and easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition a depth of 5,960 fathoms 35,760 ft 10,900 m was measured at research vessel vityaz in kaliningrad museum of world ocean the maximum surveyed depth of the challenger deep was reported in 1957 by the soviet research vessel vityaz recording a spot 11,034 metres 36,201 ft 50 m 164 ft deep at 12 it was dubbed the mariana hollow and is listed in many reference sources including the encyclop dia britannica 16 articles in national geographic 17 and on maps the pressure at this depth is approximately 1,099 times that at the surface or 111 mpa 16,099 psi 18 in 1959 the us navy research vessel rv stranger using bomb-sounding surveyed a maximum depth of 10,915 m 35,810 ft 10 m 33 ft at 3 12 in 1962 the us navy research vessel rv spencer f baird using a frequency-controlled depth recorder surveyed a maximum depth of 10,915 m 35,810 ft 10 m 33 ft at 12 in 1975 and 1980 the us navy research vessel rv thomas washington using a precision depth recorder with satellite positioning surveyed a maximum depth of 10,915 m 35,810 ft 10 m 33 ft at 12 in 1984 the survey vessel takuyo from the hydrographic department of japan used a narrow multibeam echo sounder to take a measurement of 10,924 m 35,840 ft 10 m 33 ft at 3 12 19 deep sea research vessel rv kairei in 1998 a regional bathymetric survey of the challenger deep was conducted by the deep sea research vessel rv kairei from the japan agency for marine-earth science and technology using a seabeam 2112 multibeam echosounder the regional bathymetric map made from the data obtained in 1998 shows that the greatest depths in the eastern central and western depressions are 10,922 m 35,833 ft 74 m 243 ft 10,898 m 35,755 ft 62 m 203 ft and 10,908 m 35,787 ft 36 m 118 ft respectively making the eastern depression the deepest of the three 12 in 1999 and 2002 the rv kairei revisited the challenger deep the cross track survey in the 1999 rv kairei cruise shows that the greatest depths in the eastern central and western depressions are 10,920 m 35,827 ft 10 m 33 ft 10,894 m 35,741 ft 14 m 46 ft and 10,907 m 35,784 ft 13 m 43 ft respectively which supports the results of the 1998 survey the detailed grid survey in 2002 showed that the deepest site is located in the eastern part of the eastern depression around with a depth of 10,920 m 35,827 ft 5 m 16 ft about 290 m 950 ft southeast of the deepest site determined by the survey vessel takuyo in 1984 and about 240 m 790 ft east of the deepest place determined by the 1998 rv kairei survey 12 on 1 june 2009 sonar mapping of the challenger deep by the kongsberg simrad em 120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water 300 11,000 metres mapping aboard the rv kilo moana mothership of the nereus underwater vehicle indicated a depth of 10,971 m 35,994 ft the sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection which is capable of an accuracy of 0.2 to 0.5 of water depth across the entire swath 4 5 20 in 2014 the multibeam bathymetry data of this sonar mapping have yet to be publicly released so the data are not available for comparisons with other soundings 6 on 7 october 2010 further sonar mapping of the challenger deep area was conducted by the us center for coastal ocean mapping joint hydrographic center ccom jhc aboard the usns sumner t-ags-61 the results were reported in december 2011 at the annual american geophysical union fall meeting using a kongsberg maritime em 122 multibeam echosounder system coupled to positioning equipment that can determine latitude and longitude up to 50 cm 20 in accuracy from thousands of individual soundings around the deepest part the ccom jhc team preliminary determined that the challenger deep has a maximum depth of 10,994 m 36,070 ft at with an estimated vertical uncertainty of 40 m 131 ft at 2 standard deviations 95.4 confidence level 7 a secondary deep with a depth of 10,951 m 35,928 ft was located at approximately 23.75 nmi 44.0 km to the east at in the mariana trench 8 21 22 23 in 2014 a study was conducted regarding the determination of the depth and location of the challenger deep based on data collected previous to and during the 2010 sonar mapping of the mariana trench with a kongsberg maritime em 122 multibeam echosounder system aboard the usns sumner t-ags-61 this study by james v gardner et al of the center for coastal ocean mapping-joint hydrographic center ccom jhc chase ocean engineering laboratory of the university of new hampshire splits the measurement attempt history into three main groups early single-beam echo sounders 1950s - 1970 s early multibeam echo sounders 1980s - 21st century and modern i e post-gps high-resolution multibeam echo sounders taking uncertainties in depth measurements and position estimation into account the raw data of the 2010 bathymetry of the challenger deep vicinity consisting of 2,051,371 soundings from eight survey lines was analyzed the study concludes that with the best of 2010 multibeam echosounder technologies after the analysis a depth uncertainty of 25 m 82 ft 95 confidence level on 9 degrees of freedom and a positional uncertainty of 20 to 25 m 66 to 82 ft 2drms remain and the location of the deepest depth recorded in the 2010 mapping is 10,984 m 36,037 ft at the depth measurement uncertainty is a composite of measured uncertainties in the spatial variations in sound-speed through the water volume the ray-tracing and bottom-detection algorithms of the multibeam system the accuracies and calibration of the motion sensor and navigation systems estimates of spherical spreading attenuation throughout the water volume and so forth 6 the 2009 and 2010 maximal depths were not confirmed by the series of dives nereus made to the bottom during an expedition in may june 2009 the direct descent measurements by the four expeditions which have reported from the bottom have fixed depths in a narrow range from 10,916 m trieste to 10,911 m kaik to 10,902 m nereus to 10,898 m deepsea challenger although an attempt was made to correlate locations it could not be absolutely certain that nereus or the other descents reached exactly the same points found to be maximally deep by the sonar echo sounders of previous mapping expeditions even though one of these echo soundings was made by nereus mothership descents edit manned descents edit lt don walsh usn bottom and jacques piccard center in the bathyscaphe trieste trieste edit on 23 january 1960 the swiss-designed trieste originally built in italy and acquired by the u s navy descended to the ocean floor in the trench manned by jacques piccard who co-designed the submersible along with his father auguste piccard and usn lieutenant don walsh their crew compartment was inside a spherical pressure vessel which was a heavy-duty replacement of the italian original built by krupp steel works of essen germany their descent took almost five hours and the two men spent barely twenty minutes on the ocean floor before undertaking the three-hour-and-fifteen-minute ascent their early departure from the ocean floor was due to their concern over a crack in the outer window caused by the temperature differences during their descent 24 the measured depth at the bottom was measured with a manometer at 10,916 m 35,814 ft 5 m 16 ft 12 25 deepsea challenger edit dsv deepsea challenger on 26 march 2012 local time canadian film director james cameron made a solo manned descent in the dsv deepsea challenger to the bottom of the challenger deep 9 10 11 26 at approximately 05 15 chst on 26 march 19 15 utc on 25 march the descent began 27 at 07 52 chst 21 52 utc deepsea challenger arrived at the bottom the descent lasted 2 hours and 36 minutes and the recorded depth was 10,898.4 metres 35,756 ft when deepsea challenger touched down 28 cameron had planned to spend about six hours near the ocean floor exploring but decided to start the ascent to the surface after only 2 hours and 34 minutes 29 the time on the bottom was shortened because a hydraulic fluid leak in the lines controlling the manipulator arm obscured the visibility out the only viewing port it also caused the loss of the submersible s starboard thrusters 30 at around 12 00 chst 02 00 utc on 26 march the deepsea challenger website says the sub resurfaced after a 90-minute ascent 31 although paul allen s tweets indicate the ascent took only about 67 minutes 32 during a post-dive press conference cameron said i landed on a very soft almost gelatinous flat plain once i got my bearings i drove across it for quite a distance and finally worked my way up the slope the whole time cameron said he didn t see any fish or any living creatures more than an inch 2.54 cm long the only free swimmers i saw were small amphipods shrimplike bottom-feeders 33 planned manned descents edit several other manned expeditions are planned these include 34 triton submarines a florida-based company that designs and manufactures private submarines

challenger deep created by the japan agency for marine-earth science and technology jamstec it was one of the few unmanned deep-sea probes in operation that could dive deeper than 6,000 metres 20,000 ft the manometer measured depth of 10,911 m 35,797 ft 3 m 10 ft at 39 for the challenger deep is believed to be the most accurate measurement taken yet 12 kaik also collected sediment cores containing marine organisms from the bottom of the deep 17 18 kaik made many unmanned descents to the mariana trench during three expeditions in 1995 1996 and 1998 40 the greatest depth measured by kaik in 1996 was 10,898 m 35,755 ft at and in 1998 10,907 m 35,784 ft at 12 it was lost at sea off shikoku island during typhoon chan-hom on 29 may 2003 abismo edit on 3 june 2008 the japanese robotic deep-sea probe abismo automatic bottom inspection and sampling mobile reached the bottom of the mariana trench about 150 km 93 mi east of the challenger deep and collected core samples of the deep sea sediment and water samples of the water column created by the japan agency for marine-earth science and technology jamstec it was the only unmanned deep-sea probe in use that could dive deeper than 10,000 m 32,808 ft after that of nereus during abismo s deepest mariana trench dive its manometer measured a depth of 10,258 m 33,655 ft 3 m 10 ft 41 nereus edit hrov nereus on 31 may 2009 the united states sent the nereus hybrid remotely operated vehicle hrov to the challenger deep 42 nereus thus became the first vehicle to reach the mariana trench since 1998 and the deepest-diving vehicle then in operation 42 project manager and developer andy bowen heralded the achievement as the start of a new era in ocean exploration 42 nereus unlike kaik did not need to be powered or controlled by a cable connected to a ship on the ocean surface 43 nereus spent over 10 hours at the bottom of the challenger deep and measured a depth of 10,902 m 35,768 ft at while sending live video and data back to its mothership rv kilo moana at the surface and collecting geological and biological samples from the challenger deep bottom with its manipulator arm for further scientific analysis 4 42 44 45 the nereus was operated by the woods hole oceanographic institution it was lost on may 10 2014 46 haidou-1 edit on 23 may 2016 the chinese submersible haidou-1 dove to a depth of 10,767 m 35,325 ft in the mariana trench this autonomous and remotely operated vehicle has a design depth of 11,000 m 36,089 ft 47 lifeforms edit the summary report of the hms challenger expedition lists radiolaria from the two dredged samples taken when the challenger deep was first discovered 48 these nassellaria and spumellaria were reported in the report on radiolaria 1887 49 written by ernst haeckel on their 1960 descent the crew of the trieste noted that the floor consisted of diatomaceous ooze and reported observing some type of flatfish lying on the seabed 50 and as we were settling this final fathom i saw a wonderful thing lying on the bottom just beneath us was some type of flatfish resembling a sole about 1 foot long and 6 inches across even as i saw him his two round eyes on top of his head spied us a monster of steel invading his silent realm eyes why should he have eyes merely to see phosphorescence the floodlight that bathed him was the first real light ever to enter this hadal realm here in an instant was the answer that biologists had asked for the decades could life exist in the greatest depths of the ocean it could and not only that here apparently was a true bony teleost fish not a primitive ray or elasmobranch yes a highly evolved vertebrate in time s arrow very close to man himself slowly extremely slowly this flatfish swam away moving along the bottom partly in the ooze and partly in the water he disappeared into his night slowly too perhaps everything is slow at the bottom of the sea walsh and i shook hands 51 many marine biologists are now skeptical of this supposed sighting and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a sea cucumber 52 53 the video camera on board the kaiko probe spotted a sea cucumber a scale worm and a shrimp at the bottom 54 55 at the bottom of the challenger deep the nereus probe spotted one polychaete worm a multi-legged predator about an inch long 56 an analysis of the sediment samples collected by kaiko found large numbers of simple organisms at 10,900 m 35,800 ft 57 while similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower ocean trenches 7,000 m and on the abyssal plain the lifeforms discovered in the challenger deep possibly represent taxa distinct from those in shallower ecosystems most of the organisms collected were simple soft-shelled foraminifera 432 species according to national geographic 58 with four of the others representing species of the complex multi-chambered genera leptohalysis and reophax eighty-five percent of the specimens were organic soft-shelled allogromiids which is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling organisms from other deep-sea environments where the percentage of organic-walled foraminifera ranges from 5 to 20 as small organisms with hard calcareous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because of the high solubility of calcium carbonate in the pressurized water scientists theorize that the preponderance of soft-shelled organisms in the challenger deep may have resulted from the typical biosphere present when the challenger deep was shallower than it is now over the course of six to nine million years as the challenger deep grew to its present depth many of the species present in the sediment died out or were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment 59 the species that survived the change in depth were the ancestors of the challenger deep s current denizens citation needed on 17 march 2013 researchers reported data that suggested microbial life forms thrive in the challenger deep 60 61 other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 1,900 ft 579 m below the sea floor under 8,500 ft 2,591 m of ocean off the coast of the northwestern united states 60 62 according to one of the researchers you can find microbes everywhere they re extremely adaptable to conditions and survive wherever they are 60 see also edit sirena
