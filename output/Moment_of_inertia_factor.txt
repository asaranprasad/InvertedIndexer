normalized polar moment of inertia is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the radial distribution of mass inside a planet or satellite contents 1 definition 2 solar system values 3 measurement 4 approximation 5 role in interior models 6 gallery of internal structure models 7 notes 8 references definition edit for a planetary body with principal moments of inertia a b c the moment of inertia factor is defined as 1 2 c m r 2 displaystyle frac c mr 2 where c is the polar moment of inertia of the body m is the mass of the body and r is the mean radius of the body for a sphere with uniform density c mr2 0.4 for a differentiated planet or satellite where there is an increase of density with depth c mr2 0.4 the quantity is a useful indicator of the presence and extent of a planetary core because a greater departure from the uniform-density value of 0.4 conveys a greater degree of concentration of dense materials towards the center solar system values edit the sun has by far the lowest moment of inertia factor value among solar system bodies it has by far the highest central density 7005162000000000000 162 g cm3 3 note 1 compared to 13 for earth 4 5 and a relatively low average density 1.41 g cm3 versus 5.5 for earth saturn has the lowest value among the gas giants in part because it has the lowest bulk density 7002687000000000000 0.687 g cm3 6 ganymede has the lowest moment of inertia factor among solid bodies in the solar system because of its fully differentiated interior 7 8 a result in part of tidal heating due to the laplace resonance 9 as well as its substantial component of low density water ice callisto is similar in size and bulk composition to ganymede but is not part of the orbital resonance and is less differentiated 7 8 the moon is thought to have a small core but its interior is relatively homogenous 10 11 body value source notes 00 sun 0070 0.070 3 not measured 01 mercury 0346 0.346 0.014 12 02 venus 0338unknown note 2 03 earth 0331 0.3307 14

measurement edit the polar moment of inertia is traditionally determined by combining measurements of spin quantities spin precession rate or obliquity and gravity quantities coefficients in a spherical harmonics representation of the gravity field approximation edit for bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium the darwin radau relation can provide estimates of the moment of inertia factor on the basis of shape spin and gravity quantities 21 role in interior models edit the moment of inertia factor provides an important constraint for models representing the interior structure of a planet or satellite at a minimum acceptable models of the density profile must match the volumetric mass density and moment of inertia factor of the body gallery of internal structure models edit the sun c mr2 0.070 saturn c mr2 0.210 ganymede c mr2 0.3115 earth c mr2 0.3307 callisto c mr2 0.3549 the moon c mr2 0.3929 notes edit a star s central density tends to increase over the course of its lifetime based on a theoretical model of venus s interior its mean moment of inertia has been predicted to be 0.338 13 because this model makes assumptions about the interior that are not verified by observations the prediction is of limited value the value of 0.37 given for ceres is the mean moment of inertia which is thought to better represent its interior structure than the polar moment of inertia 0.39 due to its high polar flattening 17 references edit hubbard william b 1984 new york n y van nostrand reinhold isbn 978-0442237042 oclc de pater imke lissauer jack j 2015 2nd updated ed
