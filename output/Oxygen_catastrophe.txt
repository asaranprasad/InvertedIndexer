holocaust 2 oxygen revolution or great oxidation was the biologically induced appearance of dioxygen o2 in earth s atmosphere 3 geological isotopic and chemical evidence suggest that this major environmental change happened around 2.45 billion years ago 2.45 ga 4 during the siderian period at the beginning of the proterozoic eon the causes of the event are not clear 5 the current geochemical and biomarker evidence for the development of oxygenic photosynthesis before the great oxidation event has been mostly inconclusive 6 oceanic cyanobacteria which evolved into coordinated but not multicellular or even colonial macroscopic forms more than 2.3 billion years ago approximately 200 million years before the goe 7 are believed to have become the first microbes to produce oxygen by photosynthesis 8 before the goe any free oxygen they produced was chemically captured by dissolved iron or organic matter the goe started when these oxygen sinks became saturated at which point oxygen produced by the cyanobacteria was free to escape into the atmosphere cyanobacteria responsible for the buildup of oxygen in the earth s atmosphere the increased production of oxygen set earth s original atmosphere off balance 9 free oxygen is toxic to obligate anaerobic organisms and the rising concentrations may have destroyed most such organisms at the time cyanobacteria were therefore responsible for one of the most significant mass extinctions in earth s history besides marine cyanobacteria there is also evidence of cyanobacteria on land citation needed a spike in chromium contained in ancient rock deposits formed underwater shows the accumulation had been washed off from the continental shelves chromium is not easily dissolved and its release from rocks would have required the presence of a powerful acid one such acid sulfuric acid h2so4 might have been created through bacterial reactions with pyrite 10 mats of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria can produce a thin layer one or two millimeters thick of oxygenated water in an otherwise anoxic environment even under thick ice and before oxygen started accumulating in the atmosphere these organisms would already be adapted to oxygen 11 additionally the free oxygen would have reacted with atmospheric methane a greenhouse gas greatly reducing its concentration and triggering the huronian glaciation possibly the longest episode of glaciation in earth s history and called snowball earth 12 eventually the evolution of aerobic organisms that consumed oxygen established an equilibrium in its availability free

huronian cryogenian andean karoo quaternary axis scale million years orange labels ice ages also see human timeline and nature timeline the most widely accepted chronology of the great oxygenation event suggests that free oxygen was first produced by prokaryotic and then later eukaryotic organisms that carried out photosynthesis more efficiently producing oxygen as a waste product these organisms lived long before the goe 13 perhaps as early as million years ago initially the oxygen they produced would have quickly been removed from the atmosphere by the chemical weathering of reducing oxidizable minerals most notably iron this mass rusting led to the deposition of iron iii oxide in the form of banded-iron formations such as the sediments in minnesota and pilbara western australia the saturation of these mineral sinks and the resulting persistence of oxygen in the atmosphere led within 50 million years to the start of the goe 14 oxygen could have accumulated very rapidly at today s rates of photosynthesis much greater than those in the precambrian without land plants modern atmospheric o2 levels could be produced in only 2,000 years 15 another hypothesis is that oxygen producers did not evolve until a few million years before the major rise in atmospheric oxygen concentration 16 this is based on a particular interpretation of a supposed oxygen indicator used in previous studies the mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotopes this hypothesis would eliminate the need to explain a lag in time between the evolution of oxyphotosynthetic microbes and the rise in free oxygen in either case oxygen did eventually accumulate in the atmosphere with two major consequences firstly it oxidized atmospheric methane a strong greenhouse gas to carbon dioxide a weaker one and water this decreased the greenhouse effect of the earth s atmosphere causing planetary cooling and triggered the huronian glaciation starting around 2.4 billion years ago this lasted 300-400 million years and may have been the longest ever snowball earth episode 16 17 secondly the increased oxygen concentrations provided a new opportunity for biological diversification as well as tremendous changes in the nature of chemical interactions between rocks sand clay and other geological substrates and the earth s air oceans and other surface waters despite the natural recycling of organic matter life had remained energetically limited until the widespread availability of oxygen this breakthrough in metabolic evolution greatly increased the free energy availabile to living organisms with global environmental impacts for example mitochondria evolved after the goe giving organisms the energy to exploit new more complex morphologies interacting in increasingly complex ecosystems 18 timeline of glaciations shown in blue time lag theory edit there may have been a gap of up to 900 million years between the start of photosynthetic oxygen production and the geologically rapid increase in atmospheric oxygen about 2.5 2.4 billion years ago several hypotheses propose to explain this time lag tectonic trigger edit 2.1 billion year old rock showing banded iron formation the oxygen increase had to await tectonically driven changes in the earth including the appearance of shelf seas where reduced organic carbon could reach the sediments and be buried 19 the newly produced oxygen was first consumed in various chemical reactions in the oceans primarily with iron evidence is found in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations apparently laid down as this iron and oxygen first combined most present-day iron ore lies in these deposits evidence suggests oxygen levels spiked each time smaller land masses collided to form a super-continent tectonic pressure thrust up mountain chains which eroded to release nutrients into the ocean to feed photosynthetic cyanobacteria 20 nickel famine edit early chemosynthetic organisms likely produced methane an important trap for molecular oxygen since methane readily oxidizes to carbon dioxide co2 and water in the presence of uv radiation modern methanogens require nickel as an enzyme cofactor as the earth s crust cooled and the supply of volcanic nickel dwindled oxygen-producing algae began to out-perform methane producers and the oxygen percentage of the atmosphere steadily increased 21 from 2.7 to 2.4 billion years ago the rate of deposition of nickel declined steadily from a level 400 times today s 22 bistability edit another hypothesis posits a model of the atmosphere that exhibits bistability two steady states of oxygen concentration the state of stable low oxygen conentration 0.02 experiences a high rate of methane oxidation if some event raises oxygen levels beyond a moderate threshold the formation of an ozone layer shields uv rays and decreases methane oxidation raising oxygen further to a stable state of 21 or more the great oxygenation event can then be understood as a transition from the lower to the upper steady states 23 hydrogen gas edit another theory credits the appearance of cyanobacteria with suppressing hydrogen gas and increasing oxygen some bacteria in the early oceans could separate water into hydrogen and oxygen under the sun s rays hydrogen molecules were incorporated into organic compounds with oxygen as a by-product if the hydrogen-heavy compounds were buried it would have allowed oxygen to accumulate in the atmosphere however in 2001 scientists realized that the hydrogen would instead escape into space through a process called methane photolysis in which methane releases its hydrogen in a reaction with oxygen this could explain why the early earth stayed warm enough to sustain oxygen-producing lifeforms 24 late evolution of oxy-photosynthesis theory edit the oxygen indicator might have been misinterpreted during the proposed lag era in the previous theory there was a change in sediments from mass-independently fractionated mif sulfur to mass-dependently fractionated mdf sulfur this was assumed to show the appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere since oxygen would have prevented the photolysis of sulfur dioxide which causes mif however the change from mif to mdf of sulfur isotopes may instead have been caused by an increase in glacial weathering or the homogenization of the marine sulfur pool as a result of an increased thermal gradient during the huronian glaciation period which in this interpretation was not caused by oxygenation 16 role in mineral diversification edit the great oxygenation event triggered an explosive growth in the diversity of minerals with many elements occuring in one or more oxidized forms near the earth s surface 25 it is estimated that the goe was directly responsible for more than 2,500 of the total of about 4,500 minerals found on earth today most of these new minerals were formed as hydrated and oxidized forms due to dynamic mantle and crust processes 26 great oxygenation end of huronian glaciation ediacaran cambrian ordovician silurian devonian carboniferous permian triassic jurassic cretaceous paleogene neogene quaternary pal

has been proposed that a local rise in oxygen levels due to cyanobacterial photosynthesis in ancient microenvironments was highly toxic to the surrounding biota and that this selective pressure drove the evolutionary transformation of an archaeal lineage into the first eukaryotes 27 oxidative stress involving production of reactive oxygen species ros might have acted in synergy with other environmental stresses such as ultraviolet radiation and or desiccation to drive selection in an early archaeal lineage towards eukaryosis this archaeal ancester may already have had dna repair mechanisms based on dna pairing and recombination and possibly some kind of cell fusion mechanism 28 29 the detrimental effects of internal ros produced by endosymbiont proto-mitochondria on the archaeal genome could have promoted the evolution of meiotic sex from these humble beginnings 28 selective pressure for efficient dna repair of oxidative dna damages may have driven the evolution of eukaryotic sex involving such features as cell-cell fusions cytoskeleton-mediated chromosome movements and emergence of the nuclear membrane 27 thus the evolution of eukaryotic sex and eukaryogenesis were likely inseparable processes that evolved in large part to facilitate dna repair 27 30 constant pressure of endogenous ros has been proposed to explain the ubiquitous maintenance of meiotic sex in eukaryotes 28 see also edit geological history of oxygen iodide medea hypothesis pasteur point rare earth hypothesis stromatolite references edit holland heinrich d philosophical transactions of
