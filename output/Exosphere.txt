thermosphere mesosphere stratosphere and troposphere the layers are to scale from earth s surface to the top of the stratosphere 50km is just under 1 of earth s radius the exosphere ancient greek x outside external beyond ancient greek spha ra sphere is a thin atmosphere-like volume surrounding a planet or natural satellite where molecules are gravitationally bound to that body but where the density is too low for them to behave as a gas by colliding with each other 1 in the case of bodies with substantial atmospheres such as earth s atmosphere the exosphere is the uppermost layer where the atmosphere thins out and merges with interplanetary space it is located directly above the thermosphere very little is known about it due to lack of research mercury and several large moons such as the moon and the galilean satellites of jupiter have exospheres without a denser atmosphere underneath 2 referred to as a surface boundary exosphere 3 here molecules are ejected on elliptic trajectories until they collide with the surface smaller bodies such as asteroids in which the molecules emitted from the surface escape to space are not considered to have exospheres contents 1 earth s exosphere 1.1 lower boundary 1.2 upper boundary of earth 2 moon s exosphere 3 references 4 external links earth s exosphere edit the most common molecules within earth s exosphere are those of the lightest atmospheric gases hydrogen is present throughout the exosphere with some helium carbon dioxide and atomic oxygen near its base because it can be hard to define the boundary between the exosphere and outer space see upper boundary at the end of this section the exosphere may be considered a part of interplanetary or outer space lower boundary edit the lower boundary of the exosphere is called the exobase it is also called exopause and critical altitude as this is the altitude where barometric conditions no longer apply atmospheric temperature becomes nearly a constant above this altitude 4 on earth the altitude of the exobase ranges from about 500 to 1,000 kilometres 310 to 620 mi depending on solar activity 5 the exobase can be defined in one of two ways if we define the exobase as the height at which upward-traveling molecules experience one collision on average then at this position the mean free path of a molecule is equal to one pressure scale height this is shown in the following consider a volume of air with horizontal area a displaystyle a and height equal to the mean free path l displaystyle l at pressure p displaystyle p and temperature t displaystyle t for an ideal gas the number of molecules contained in it is n p a l r t displaystyle n frac pal rt where r displaystyle r is the universal gas constant from the requirement that each molecule traveling upward undergoes on average one collision the pressure is p m a n g a displaystyle p frac m a ng a where m a displaystyle m a is the mean molecular mass of the gas solving these two equations gives l r t m a g displaystyle l frac rt m a g which is the equation for the pressure scale height as the pressure scale height is almost equal to the density scale height of the primary constituent and because the knudsen number is the ratio of mean free path and typical density fluctuation scale this means that the exobase lies in the region where k n h e b 1 displaystyle mathrm kn h eb simeq 1 the fluctuation in the height of the exobase is important because this provides atmospheric drag on satellites eventually causing them to fall from orbit if no action is taken to maintain the orbit upper boundary of earth edit in principle the exosphere covers distances where particles are still gravitationally bound to earth i e particles still have ballistic orbits that will take them back towards earth the upper boundary of the exosphere can be defined as the distance at which the influence of solar radiation pressure on atomic hydrogen exceeds that of earth s gravitational pull this happens at half the distance to the moon the average distance between earth and the moon is 384,400 kilometres 238,900 mi the exosphere observable from space as the geocorona is seen to extend to at least 10,000 kilometres 6,200 mi from earth s surface the exosphere is a transitional zone between earth s atmosphere and space moon s exosphere edit on 17 august 2015 based on studies
