english finally fell into disuse in early modern english printing thorn was represented with the latin y which appeared similar to thorn in blackletter typeface the last vestige of the letter was in ligatures of thorn ye thee yt that yu thou which were still seen occasionally in the king james bible of 1611 and in shakespeare s folios the letters i and j previously written as a single letter began to be distinguished likewise for u and v this was a common development of the latin alphabet during this period consequently modern english came to use a purely latin alphabet of 26 letters see
