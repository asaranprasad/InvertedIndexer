references 1 2 3 4 sheet mica mica flakes dark mica from eastern ontario the mica group of sheet silicate phyllosilicate minerals includes several closely related materials having nearly perfect basal cleavage all are monoclinic with a tendency towards pseudohexagonal crystals and are similar in chemical composition the nearly perfect cleavage which is the most prominent characteristic of mica is explained by the hexagonal sheet-like arrangement of its atoms the word mica is derived from the latin word mica meaning a crumb and probably influenced by micare to glitter 5 contents 1

interlayer-deficient micas edit very fine-grained micas which typically show more variation in ion and water content are informally termed clay micas they include hydro-muscovite with h3o along with k in the x site illite with a k deficiency in the x site and correspondingly more si in the z site phengite with mg or fe2 substituting for al in the y site and a corresponding increase in si in the z site occurrence and production edit play media mica embedded in metamorphic rock mica is widely distributed and occurs in igneous metamorphic and sedimentary regimes large crystals of mica used for various applications are typically mined from granitic pegmatites until the 19th century large crystals of mica were quite rare and expensive as a result of the limited supply in europe however their price dramatically dropped when large reserves were found and mined in africa and south america during the early 19th century the largest documented single crystal of mica phlogopite was found in lacey mine ontario canada it measured 10 m 4.3 m 4.3 m 33 ft 14 ft 14 ft and weighed about 330 tonnes 320 long tons 360 short tons 8 similar-sized crystals were also found in karelia russia 9 the british geological survey reported that as of 2005 koderma district in jharkhand state in india had the largest deposits of mica in the world china was the top producer of mica with almost a third of the global share closely followed by the us south korea and canada large deposits of sheet mica were mined in new england from the 19th century to the 1970s large mines existed in connecticut new hampshire and maine scrap and flake mica is produced all over the world in 2010 the major producers were russia 100,000 tonnes finland 68,000 t united states 53,000 t south korea 50,000 t france 20,000 t and canada 15,000 t the total global production was 350,000 t although no reliable data were available for china most sheet mica was produced in india 3,500 t and russia 1,500 t 10 flake mica comes from several sources the metamorphic rock called schist as a byproduct of processing feldspar and kaolin resources from placer deposits and from pegmatites sheet mica is considerably less abundant than flake and scrap mica and is occasionally recovered from mining scrap and flake mica the most important sources of sheet mica are pegmatite deposits sheet mica prices vary with grade and can range from less than 1 per kilogram for low-quality mica to more than 2,000 per kilogram for the highest quality 11 properties and uses edit the mica group represents 37 phyllosilicate minerals that have a layered or platy texture the commercially important micas are muscovite and phlogopite which are used in a variety of applications mica s value is based on several of its unique physical properties the crystalline structure of mica forms layers that can be split or delaminated into thin sheets usually causing foliation in rocks these sheets are chemically inert dielectric elastic flexible hydrophilic insulating lightweight platy reflective refractive resilient and range in opacity from transparent to opaque mica is stable when exposed to electricity light moisture and extreme temperatures it has superior electrical properties as an insulator and as a dielectric and can support an electrostatic field while dissipating minimal energy in the form of heat it can be split very thin 0.025 to 0.125 millimeters or thinner while maintaining its electrical properties has a high dielectric breakdown is thermally stable to 500 c 932 f and is resistant to corona discharge muscovite the principal mica used by the electrical industry is used in capacitors that are ideal for high frequency and radio frequency phlogopite mica remains stable at higher temperatures to 900 c 1,650 f and is used in applications in which a combination of high-heat stability and electrical properties is required muscovite and phlogopite are used in sheet and ground forms 11 ground mica edit the leading use of dry-ground mica in the us is in the joint compound for filling and finishing seams and blemishes in gypsum wallboard drywall the mica acts as a filler and extender provides a smooth consistency improves the workability of the compound and provides resistance to cracking in 2008 joint compound accounted for 54 of dry-ground mica consumption in the paint industry ground mica is used as a pigment extender that also facilitates suspension reduces chalking prevents shrinking and shearing of the paint film increases the resistance of the paint film to water penetration and weathering and brightens the tone of colored pigments mica also promotes paint adhesion in aqueous and oleoresinous formulations consumption of dry-ground mica in paint the second-ranked use accounted for 22 of the dry-ground mica used in 2008 11 ground mica is used in the well-drilling industry as an additive to drilling fluids the coarsely ground mica flakes help prevent the loss of circulation by sealing porous sections of the drill hole well drilling muds accounted for 15 of dry-ground mica use in 2008 the plastics industry used dry-ground mica as an extender and filler especially in parts for automobiles as lightweight insulation to suppress sound and vibration mica is used in plastic automobile fascia and fenders as a reinforcing material providing improved mechanical properties and increased dimensional stability stiffness and strength mica-reinforced plastics also have high-heat dimensional stability reduced warpage and the best surface properties of any filled plastic composite in 2008 consumption of dry-ground mica in plastic applications accounted for 2 of the market the rubber industry used ground mica as an inert filler and mold release compound in the manufacture of molded rubber products such as tires and roofing the platy texture acts as an anti-blocking anti-sticking agent rubber mold lubricant accounted for 1.5 of the dry-ground mica used in 2008 as a rubber additive mica reduces gas permeation and improves resiliency 11 dry-ground mica is used in the production of rolled roofing and asphalt shingles where it serves as a surface coating to prevent sticking of adjacent surfaces the coating is not absorbed by freshly manufactured roofing because mica s platy structure is unaffected by the acid in asphalt or by weather conditions mica is used in decorative coatings on wallpaper concrete stucco and tile surfaces it also is used as an ingredient in flux coatings on welding rods in some special greases and as coatings for core and mold release compounds facing agents and mold washes in foundry applications dry-ground phlogopite mica is used in automotive brake linings and clutch plates to reduce noise and vibration asbestos substitute as sound-absorbing insulation for coatings and polymer systems in reinforcing additives for polymers to increase strength and stiffness and to improve stability to heat chemicals and ultraviolet uv radiation in heat shields and temperature insulation in industrial coating additive to decrease the permeability of moisture and hydrocarbons and in polar polymer formulations to increase the strength of epoxies nylons and polyesters 11 mica flakes embedded in a fresco for glitter wet-ground mica which retains the brilliance of its cleavage faces is used primarily in pearlescent paints by the automotive industry many metallic-looking pigments are composed of a substrate of mica coated with another mineral usually titanium dioxide tio2 the resultant pigment produces a reflective color depending on the thickness of the coating these products are used to produce automobile paint shimmery plastic containers high-quality inks used in advertising and security applications in the cosmetics industry its reflective and refractive properties make mica an important ingredient in blushes eye liner eye shadow foundation hair and body glitter lipstick lip gloss mascara moisturizing lotions and nail polish some brands of toothpaste include powdered white mica this acts as a mild abrasive to aid polishing of the tooth surface and also adds a cosmetically pleasing glittery shimmer to the paste mica is added to latex balloons to provide a colored shiny surface 11 mica is also used as an insulator in concrete block and home attics and can be poured into walls usually in retrofitting uninsulated open top walls mica may also be used as a soil conditioner especially in potting soil mixes and in gardening plots greases used for axles are composed of a compound of fatty oils to which mica tar or graphite is added to increase the durability of the grease and give it a better surface built-up mica edit muscovite and phlogopite splittings can be fabricated into various built-up mica products produced by mechanized or hand setting of overlapping splittings and alternate layers of binders and splittings built-up mica is used primarily as an electrical insulation material mica insulation is used in high-temperature and fire-resistant power cables in aluminium plants blast furnaces critical wiring circuits for example defense systems fire and security alarm systems and surveillance systems heaters and boilers lumber kilns metal smelters and tanks and furnace wiring specific high-temperature mica-insulated wire and cable is rated to work for up to 15 minutes in molten aluminium glass and steel major products are bonding materials flexible heater molding and segment plates mica paper and tape 11 flexible plate is used in electric motor and generator armatures field coil insulation and magnet and commutator core insulation mica consumption in flexible plate was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the us heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required molding plate is sheet mica from which v-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures motor starters and transformers segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears at the same rate as the copper segments although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the us some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth glass linen muslin plastic silk or special paper these products are very flexible and are produced in wide continuous sheets that are either shipped rolled or cut into ribbons or tapes or trimmed to specified dimensions built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering in 2008 about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the us mostly for molding plates 19 and segment plates 42 11 sheet mica edit mica insulator items silver mica capacitors muscovite windows technical grade sheet mica is used in electrical components electronics in atomic force microscopy and as window sheets other uses include diaphragms for oxygen-breathing equipment marker dials for navigation compasses optical filters pyrometers thermal regulators stove and kerosene heater windows radiation aperture covers for microwave ovens and micathermic heater elements mica is birefringent and is therefore commonly used to make quarter and half wave plates specialized applications for sheet mica are found in aerospace components in air- ground- and sea-launched missile systems laser devices medical electronics and radar systems mica is mechanically stable in micrometer-thin sheets which are relatively transparent to radiation such as alpha particles while being impervious to most gases it is therefore used as a window on radiation detectors such as geiger-m ller tubes in 2008 mica splittings represented the largest part of the sheet mica industry in the united states consumption of muscovite and phlogopite splittings was about 308 t in 2008 muscovite splittings from india accounted for essentially all us consumption the remainder was primarily imported from madagascar 11 small squared pieces of sheet mica are also used in the traditional japanese kodo ceremony to burn incense a burning piece of coal is placed inside a cone made of white ash the sheet of mica is placed on top acting as a separator between the heat source and the incense in order to spread the fragrance without burning it electrical and electronic edit sheet mica is used principally in the electronic and electrical industries its usefulness in these applications is derived from its unique electrical and thermal properties and its mechanical properties which allow it to be cut punched stamped and machined to close tolerances specifically mica is unusual in that it is a good electrical insulator at the same time as being a good thermal conductor the leading use of block mica is as an electrical insulator in electronic equipment high-quality block mica is processed to line the gauge glasses of high-pressure steam boilers because of its flexibility transparency and resistance to heat and chemical attack only high-quality muscovite film mica which is variously called india ruby mica or ruby muscovite mica is used as a dielectric in capacitors the highest quality mica film is used to manufacture capacitors for calibration standards the next lower grade is used in transmitting capacitors receiving capacitors use a slightly lower grade of high-quality muscovite 11 mica sheets are used to provide structure for heating wire such as in kanthal or nichrome in heating elements and can withstand up to 900 c 1,650 f peepholes edit thin transparent sheets of mica were used for peepholes in boilers lanterns stoves and kerosene heaters because they were less likely to shatter than glass when exposed to extreme temperature gradients such peepholes were also used in isinglass curtains in horse-drawn carriages 12 and early 20th century cars 13 atomic force microscopy edit another use of mica is as a substrate in the production of ultraflat thin-film surfaces e g gold surfaces although the deposited film surface is still rough due to deposition kinetics the back side of the film at the mica-film interface is ultraflat once the film is removed from the substrate freshly-cleaved mica surfaces have been used as clean imaging substrates in atomic force microscopy 14 enabling for example the imaging of bismuth films 15 plasma glycoproteins 16 membrane bilayers 17 and dna molecules 18 early history edit human use of mica dates back to prehistoric times mica was known to ancient indian egyptian greek and roman and chinese civilizations as well as the aztec civilization of the new world citation needed the earliest use of mica has been found in cave paintings created during the upper paleolithic period 40,000 bc to 10,000 bc the first hues were red iron oxide hematite or red ochre and black manganese dioxide pyrolusite though black from juniper or pine carbons has also been discovered white from kaolin or mica was used occasionally a few kilometers northeast of mexico city stands the ancient site of teotihuacan the most striking structure of teotihuacan is the towering pyramid of the sun the pyramid contained considerable amounts of mica in layers up to 30 cm 12 in thick 19 natural mica was and still is used by the taos and picuris pueblos indians in north-central new mexico to make pottery the pottery is made from weathered precambrian mica schist and has flecks of mica throughout the vessels tewa pueblo pottery is made by coating the clay with mica to provide a dense glittery micaceous finish over the entire object 11 mica flakes called abrak in urdu and written as are also used in pakistan to embellish women s summer clothes especially dupattas long light-weight scarves often colorful and matching the dress 20 21 thin mica flakes are added to a hot starch water solution and the dupatta is dipped in this water mixture for 3 5 minutes then it is hung to air dry mica powder edit this section does not cite any sources please help by adding citations to reliable sources

decorations powdered mica glitter is used to decorate traditional water clay pots in india pakistan and bangladesh it is also used on traditional pueblo pottery though not restricted to use on water pots in this case the gulal and abir colored powders used by north indian hindus during the festive season of holi contain fine crystals of mica to create a sparkling effect the majestic padmanabhapuram palace 65 km 40 mi from trivandrum in india has colored mica windows medicine edit ayurveda the hindu system of ancient medicine prevalent in india includes the purification and processing of mica in preparing abhraka bhasma which is employed in treating diseases of the respiratory and digestive tracts 22 23 health impact edit mica dust in the workplace is regarded as a hazardous substance for respiratory exposure above certain concentrations the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for mica exposure in the workplace as 20 mppcf over an 8-hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of 3 mg m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday at levels of 1,500 mg m3 mica is immediately dangerous to life and health 24 substitutes edit some lightweight aggregates such as diatomite perlite and vermiculite may be substituted for ground mica when used as filler ground synthetic fluorophlogopite 25 a fluorine-rich mica may replace natural ground mica for uses that require thermal and electrical properties of mica many materials can be substituted for mica in numerous electrical electronic and insulation uses substitutes include acrylate polymers cellulose acetate fiberglass fishpaper nylon phenolics polycarbonate polyester styrene vinyl-pvc and vulcanized fiber mica paper made from scrap mica can be substituted for sheet mica in electrical and insulation applications 10 hand carved from mica from the hopewell tradition
