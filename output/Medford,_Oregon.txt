surveyors headed by s l dolson and david loring arrived in rock point near present-day gold hill 7 they were charged with finding the best route through the rogue valley for the oregon and california railroad citizens of neighboring jacksonville hoped that it would pass between their town and hanley butte near the present day claire hanley arboretum such a move would have all but guaranteed prosperous growth for jacksonville but dolson decided instead to stake the railroad closer to bear creek 8 the response from jacksonville was mixed 9 but the decision was final by november 1883 a depot site had been chosen and a surveying team led by charles j howard was hard at work platting the new town they completed their work in early december 1883 laying out 82 blocks for development 10 james sullivan howard a merchant and surveyor 11 claimed to have built the town s first building in january 1884 12 though blacksmith emil piel was advertising for business at the central depot in the middle of december 1883 13 others point out the farms of town founders iradell judson phipps and charles wesley broback which were present before the town was platted 12 regardless on february 6 1884 less than a month after it was built j s howard s store became medford s first post office with howard serving as postmaster the establishment of the post office led to the incorporation of medford as a town by the oregon legislative assembly on february 24 1885 14 and again as a city in 1905 howard held the position of postmaster for medford s first ten years and again held the post upon his death on november 13 1919 15 the beginning of the 20th century was a transitional period for the area medford built a new steel bridge over bear creek to replace an earlier one which washed away three years before without a bridge those wanting to cross had to ford the stream typically using a horse-drawn wagon the first automobile did not arrive in medford until 1903 16 pharmacist george h haskins had opened a drugstore just after the town was platted and in 1903 he allowed the medford library association to open a small library in that store five years later the library moved to medford s new city hall in another four years andrew carnegie s donation allowed a dedicated library to be built construction on the medford carnegie library was completed in 1912 17 18 in 1927 medford took the title of county seat of jackson county away from nearby jacksonville 6 19 in 1967 20 interstate 5 was completed immediately adjacent to downtown medford to replace the oregon pacific highway it has been blamed for the decline of small businesses in downtown medford since its completion 20 but nevertheless remains an important route for commuters wishing to travel across the city in fact a study completed in 1999 found that 45 of vehicles entering i-5 from north medford heading south exited in south medford just three miles 5 km away 21 the high volume of traffic on interstate 5 led to the completion of a new north medford interchange in 2006 the project which cost about 36 million improved traffic flow between i-5 and crater lake highway 22 further traffic problems identified in south medford prompted the construction of another new interchange costing 72 million the project began in 2006 and was completed in 2010 23 24 25 since the 1990s medford has dedicated an appreciable amount of resources to urban renewal in an attempt to revitalize the downtown area 26 several old buildings have been restored including the craterian ginger rogers theater and the prohibition era cooley-neff warehouse now operating as pallet wine company an urban winery streets have been realigned new sidewalks traffic signals and bicycle lanes were installed and two new parking garages have been built downtown medford also received a new library building to replace the historic medford carnegie library and now boasts satellite campuses for both rogue community college and southern oregon university 27 economic problems in 2008 and 2009 put a hold on the commons project a collaboration between the city of medford and lithia motors 28 the project one of the largest undertaken in downtown in recent years aims to provide more parking recreation and commerce to the area before the work stopped the greyhound bus depot was moved and 850,000 was spent replacing water lines the commons is anchored by the new corporate headquarters of lithia motors inc nyse lad included in the commons are two public park blocks slated to be informal public gathering areas as well as an area for special events such as the

medford also experiences temperature inversions in the winter which during its lumber mill days produced fog so thick that visibility could be reduced to less than five feet these inversions can last

lowering air quality for several months without relief 36 37 not in citation given medford residents do experience snowfall during the winter months however due to the weather shadow effect it only
