external links etymology edit tokyo was originally known as edo which means estuary 20 its name was changed to tokyo t ky t east and ky capital when it became the imperial capital with the arrival of emperor meiji in 1868 21 in line with the east asian tradition of including the word capital in the name of the capital city like kyoto- beijing- and nanjing- 20 during the early meiji period the city was also called t kei an alternative pronunciation for the same chinese characters representing tokyo making it a kanji homograph some surviving official english documents use the spelling tokei 22 however this pronunciation is now obsolete 23 the name tokyo was first suggested in 1813 in the book kond hisaku ja secret plan of commingling written by sat nobuhiro citation needed when kubo toshimichi proposed the renaming to the government during the meiji restoration according to oda kanshi vague he got the idea from that book history edit pre-1869 edo period edit a painting depicting the commodore matthew perry expedition and his first arrival to japan in 1853 tokyo was originally a small fishing village named edo 9 in what was formerly part of the old musashi province 24 edo was first fortified by the edo clan in the late twelfth century in 1457 ta d kan built edo castle in 1590 tokugawa ieyasu made edo his base when he became shogun in 1603 the town became the center of his nationwide military government during the subsequent edo period edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century 25 edo became the de facto capital of japan 26 even while the emperor lived in kyoto the imperial capital during this time the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the pax tokugawa and in the presence of such peace edo adopted a stringent policy of seclusion which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city 27 the absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires earthquakes and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city however this prolonged period of seclusion came to an end with the arrival of american commodore matthew c perry in 1853 commodore perry negotiated the opening of the ports of shimoda and hakodate leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation 28 social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations especially in the form of the smashing of rice establishments 29 meanwhile supporters of the meiji emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last tokugawa shogun yoshinobu in 1867 30 after 265 years the pax tokugawa came to an end kidai sh ran 1805 it illustrates scenes from the edo period taking place along the nihonbashi main street in tokyo 1869 1943 edit ginza area in 1933 in 1869 the 17-year-old emperor meiji moved to edo and in accordance the city was renamed tokyo meaning eastern capital the city was divided into yamanote and shitamachi tokyo was already the nation s political and cultural center 31 and the emperor s residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well with the former edo castle becoming the imperial palace the city of tokyo was officially established on may 1 1889 central tokyo like osaka has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way this differs from many cities in the united states that are low-density and automobile-centric though expressways have been built in tokyo the basic design has not changed tokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century the 1923 great kant earthquake which left 140,000 dead or missing and world war ii 32 1943 present edit tokyo burning in 1945 in 1943 the city of tokyo merged with the metropolitan prefecture of tokyo since then the tokyo metropolitan government served as both the prefecture government for tokyo as well as administering the special wards of tokyo for what had previously been tokyo city world war ii wrought widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent allied air raids on japan and the use of incendiary bombs the bombing of tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed 33 the deadliest night of the war came on march 9 10 1945 the night of the american operation meetinghouse raid 34 as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city mainly in heavily residential wards two-fifths of the city were completely burned more than 276,000 buildings were demolished 100,000 civilians were killed and 110,000 more were injured 35 36 between 1940 and 1945 the population of japan s capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000 with the majority of those who lost their homes living in ramshackle makeshift huts 37 the tokyo tower built in 1958 2011 t hoku earthquake did slight damage to the antenna of tokyo tower after the war tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 summer olympics the 1970s brought new high-rise developments such as sunshine 60 a new and controversial 38 airport at narita in 1978 some distance outside city limits and a population increase to about 11 million in the metropolitan area tokyo s subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world 39 as more and more people moved to the area in the 1980s real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble the bubble burst in the early 1990s and many companies banks and individuals were caught with mortgage backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value a major recession followed making the 1990s japan s lost decade 40 from which it is now slowly recovering tokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land recent projects include ebisu garden place tennozu isle shiodome roppongi hills shinagawa now also a shinkansen station and the marunouchi side of tokyo station buildings of significance are demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as omotesando hills land reclamation projects in tokyo have also been going on for centuries the most prominent is the odaiba area now a major shopping and entertainment center various plans have been proposed 41 for transferring national government functions from tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of japan in order to slow down rapid development in tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country these plans have been controversial 42 within japan and have yet to be realized the 2011 t hoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of honshu was felt in tokyo however due to tokyo s earthquake-resistant infrastructure damage in tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami 43 although activity in the city was largely halted 44 the subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left tokyo unaffected despite occasional spikes in radiation levels 45 46 on september 7 2013 the ioc selected tokyo to host the 2020 summer olympics tokyo will be the first asian city to host the olympic games twice 47 geography edit

incorporated city while falling under the jurisdiction of tokyo metropolitan government each ward is also a borough with its own elected leader and council like other cities of japan the special wards use the word city in their official english name e g chiyoda city the wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government certain municipal functions such as waterworks sewerage and fire-fighting are handled by the tokyo metropolitan government to pay for the added administrative costs the prefecture collects municipal taxes which would

uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these such minor quakes magnitudes 4 6 that can be felt in single year something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety to not only to foreign visitors but japanese from elsewhere as well they rarely cause much damage sometimes a few injuries as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent chiba and ibaraki 55 infrequent powerful quakes edit tokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703 1782 1812 1855 1923
