https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology topology from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search m bius strips which have only one surface and one edge are a kind of object studied in topology in mathematics topology from the greek place and study is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations such as stretching crumpling and bending but not tearing or gluing this can be studied by considering a collection of subsets called open sets that satisfy certain properties turning the given set into what is known as a topological space important topological properties include connectedness and compactness 1 topology developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory through analysis of concepts such as space dimension and transformation 2 such ideas go back to gottfried leibniz who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs greek-latin for geometry of place and analysis situs greek-latin for picking apart of place leonhard euler s seven bridges of k nigsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field s first theorems the term topology was introduced by johann benedict listing in the 19th century although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed by the middle of the 20th century topology had become a major branch of

solved by euler topology as a well-defined mathematical discipline originates in the early part of the twentieth century but some isolated results can be traced back several centuries 3 among these are certain questions in geometry investigated by leonhard euler his 1736 paper on the seven bridges of k nigsberg is regarded as one of the first practical applications of topology 3 on 14 november 1750 euler wrote to a friend that he had realised the importance of the edges of a polyhedron this led to his polyhedron formula v e f 2 where v e and f respectively indicate the number of vertices edges and faces of the polyhedron some authorities regard this analysis as the first theorem signalling the birth of topology 4 5 further contributions were made by augustin-louis cauchy ludwig schl fli johann benedict listing bernhard riemann and enrico betti 6 listing introduced the term topologie in vorstudien zur topologie written in his native german in 1847 having used the word for ten years in correspondence before its first appearance in print 7 the english form topology was used in 1883 in listing s obituary in the journal nature to distinguish qualitative geometry from the ordinary geometry in which quantitative relations chiefly are treated 8 the term topologist in the sense of a specialist in topology was used in 1905 in the magazine spectator citation needed their work was corrected consolidated and greatly extended by henri poincar in 1895 he published his ground-breaking paper on analysis situs which introduced the concepts now known as homotopy and homology which are now considered part of algebraic topology 6 topological characteristics of closed 2-manifolds 6 manifold euler no orientability betti numbers torsion coefficient 1-dimensional b0 b1 b2

spaces of georg cantor vito volterra cesare arzel jacques hadamard giulio ascoli and others maurice fr chet introduced the metric space in 1906 9 a metric space is now considered a special case of a general topological space with any given topological space potentially giving rise to many distinct metric spaces in 1914 felix hausdorff coined the term topological space and gave the definition for what is now called a hausdorff space 10 currently a topological space is a slight generalization of hausdorff spaces given in 1922 by kazimierz kuratowski 11 modern topology depends strongly on the ideas of set theory developed by georg cantor in the later part of the 19th century in addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory cantor considered point sets in euclidean space as part of his study of fourier series for further developments see point-set topology and algebraic topology introduction edit topology can be formally defined as the study of qualitative properties of certain objects called topological spaces that are invariant under a certain kind of transformation called a continuous map especially those properties that are invariant under a certain kind of invertible transformation called homeomorphism topology is also used to refer to a structure imposed upon a set x a structure that essentially characterizes the set x as a topological space by taking proper care of properties such as convergence connectedness and continuity upon transformation topological spaces show up naturally in almost every branch of mathematics this has made topology one of the great unifying ideas of mathematics the motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved but rather on the way they are put together for example the square and the circle have many properties in common they are both one dimensional objects from a topological point of view and both separate the plane into two parts the part inside and the part outside in one of the first papers in topology leonhard euler demonstrated that it was impossible to find a route through the town of k nigsberg now kaliningrad that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once this result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges nor on their distance from one another but only on connectivity properties which bridges connect to which islands or riverbanks this problem in introductory mathematics called seven bridges of k nigsberg led to the branch of mathematics known as graph theory a continuous deformation a type of homeomorphism of a mug into a doughnut torus and back similarly the hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology says that one cannot comb the hair flat on a hairy ball without creating a cowlick this fact is immediately convincing to most people even though they might not recognize the more formal statement of the theorem that there is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on the sphere as with the bridges of k nigsberg the result does not depend on the shape of the sphere it applies to any kind of smooth blob as long as it has no holes to deal with these problems that do not rely on the exact shape of the objects one must be clear about just what properties these problems do rely on from this need arises the notion of homeomorphism the impossibility of crossing each bridge just once applies to any arrangement of bridges homeomorphic to those in k nigsberg and the hairy ball theorem applies to any space homeomorphic to a sphere intuitively two spaces are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing a traditional joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut since a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it while shrinking the hole into a handle homeomorphism can be considered the most basic topological equivalence another is homotopy equivalence this is harder to describe without getting technical but the essential notion is that two objects are homotopy equivalent if they both result from squishing some larger object equivalence classes of the english i e latin alphabet sans-serif homeomorphism homotopy equivalence an introductory exercise is to classify the uppercase letters of the english alphabet according to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence the result depends partially on the font used the figures use the sans-serif myriad font homotopy equivalence is a rougher relationship than homeomorphism a homotopy equivalence class can contain several homeomorphism classes the simple case of homotopy equivalence described above can be used here to show two letters are homotopy equivalent for example o fits inside p and the tail of the p can be squished to the hole part homeomorphism classes are no holes corresponding with c g i j l m n s u v w and z no holes and three tails corresponding with e f t and y clarification needed no holes and four tails corresponding with x one hole and no tail corresponding with d and o one hole and one tail corresponding with p and q one hole and two tails corresponding with a and r two holes and no tail corresponding with b and a bar with four tails corresponding with h and k the bar on the k is almost too short to see homotopy classes are larger because the tails can be squished down to a point they are one hole two holes and no holes to classify the letters correctly we must show that two letters in the same class are equivalent and two letters in different classes are not equivalent in the case of homeomorphism this can be done by selecting points and showing their removal disconnects the letters differently for example x and y are not homeomorphic because removing the center point of the x leaves four pieces whatever point in y corresponds to this point its removal can leave at most three pieces the case of homotopy equivalence is harder and requires a more elaborate argument showing an algebraic invariant such as the fundamental group is different on the supposedly differing classes letter topology has practical relevance in stencil typography for instance braggadocio font stencils are made of one connected piece of material concepts edit topologies on sets edit the term topology also refers to a specific mathematical idea central to the area of mathematics called topology informally a topology tells how elements of a set relate spatially to each other the same set can have different topologies for instance the real line the complex plane which is a 1-dimensional complex vector space and the cantor set can be thought of as the same set with different topologies formally let x be a set and let be a family of subsets of x then is called a topology on x if both the empty set and x are elements of any union of elements of is an element of any intersection of finitely many elements of is an element of if is a topology on x then the pair x is called a topological space the notation x may be used to denote a set x endowed with the particular topology the members of are called open sets in x a subset of x is said to be closed if its complement is in i e its complement is open a subset of x may be open closed both clopen set or neither the empty set and x itself are always both closed and open a subset of x including an open set containing a point x is called a neighborhood of x continuous functions and homeomorphisms edit a function or map from one topological space to another is called continuous if the inverse image of any open set is open if the function maps the real numbers to the real numbers both spaces with the standard topology then this definition of continuous is equivalent to the definition of continuous in calculus if a continuous function is one-to-one and onto and if the inverse of the function is also continuous then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology if two spaces are homeomorphic they have identical topological properties and are considered topologically the same the cube and the sphere are homeomorphic as are the coffee cup and the doughnut but the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut manifolds edit while topological spaces can be extremely varied and exotic many areas of topology focus on the more familiar class of spaces known as manifolds a manifold is a topological space that resembles euclidean space near each point more precisely each point of an n-dimensional manifold has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to the euclidean space of dimension n lines and circles but not figure eights are one-dimensional manifolds two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces examples include the plane the sphere and the torus which can all be realized without self-intersection in three dimensions but also the klein bottle and real projective plane which cannot topics edit general topology edit general topology is the branch of topology dealing with the basic set-theoretic definitions and constructions used in topology 12 13 it is the foundation of most other branches of topology including differential topology geometric topology and algebraic topology another name for general topology is point-set topology the fundamental concepts in point-set topology are continuity compactness and connectedness intuitively continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points compact sets are those that can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size connected sets are sets that cannot be divided into two pieces that are far apart the words nearby arbitrarily small and far apart can all be made precise by using open sets if we change the definition of open set we change what continuous functions compact sets and connected sets are each choice of definition for open set is called a topology a set with a topology is called a topological space metric spaces are an important class of topological spaces where distances can be assigned a number called a metric having a metric simplifies many proofs and many of the most common topological spaces are metric spaces algebraic topology edit algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces 14 the basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence the most important of these invariants are homotopy groups homology and cohomology although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible algebraic topology for example allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group differential topology edit differential topology is the field dealing with differentiable functions on differentiable manifolds 15 it is closely related to differential geometry and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds more specifically differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a smooth structure on a manifold to be defined smooth manifolds are softer than manifolds with extra geometric structures which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and deformations that exist in differential topology for instance volume and riemannian curvature are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold that is one can smoothly flatten out certain manifolds but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume geometric topology edit geometric topology is a branch of topology that primarily focuses on low-dimensional manifolds i e dimensions 2,3 and 4 and their interaction with geometry but it also includes some higher-dimensional topology 16 17 some examples of topics in geometric topology are orientability handle decompositions local flatness crumpling and the planar and higher-dimensional sch nflies theorem in high-dimensional topology characteristic classes are a basic invariant and surgery theory is a key theory low-dimensional topology is strongly geometric as reflected in the uniformization theorem in 2 dimensions every surface admits a constant curvature metric geometrically it has one of 3 possible geometries positive curvature spherical zero curvature flat negative curvature hyperbolic and the geometrization conjecture now theorem in 3 dimensions every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces each of which has one of eight possible geometries 2-dimensional topology can be studied as complex geometry in one variable riemann surfaces are complex curves by the uniformization theorem every conformal class of metrics is equivalent to a unique complex one and 4-dimensional topology can be studied from the point of view of complex geometry in two variables complex surfaces though not every 4-manifold admits a complex structure generalizations edit occasionally one needs to use the tools of topology but a set of points is not available in pointless topology one considers instead the lattice of open sets as the basic notion of the theory 18 while grothendieck topologies are structures defined on arbitrary categories that allow the definition of sheaves on those categories and with that the definition of general cohomology theories 19 applications edit biology edit knot theory a branch of topology is used in biology to study the effects of certain enzymes on dna these enzymes cut twist and reconnect the dna causing knotting with observable effects such as slower electrophoresis 20 topology is also used in evolutionary biology to represent the relationship between phenotype and genotype 21 phenotypic forms that appear quite different can be separated by only a few mutations depending on how genetic changes map to phenotypic changes during development in neuroscience topological quantities like the euler characteristic and betti number have been used to measure the complexity of patterns of activity in neural networks computer science edit topological data analysis uses techniques from algebraic topology to determine the large scale structure of a set for instance determining if a cloud of points is spherical or toroidal the main method used by topological data analysis is replace a set of data points with a family of simplicial complexes indexed by a proximity parameter analyse these topological complexes via algebraic topology specifically via the theory of persistent homology 22 encode the persistent homology of a data set in the form of a parameterized version of a betti number which is called a barcode 22 physics edit in physics topology is used in several areas such as condensed matter physics 23 quantum field theory and physical cosmology the topological dependence of mechanical properties in solids is of interest in disciplines of mechanical engineering and materials science electrical and mechanical properties depend on the arrangement and network structures of molecules and elementary units in materials 24 the compressive strength of crumpled topologies is studied in attempts to understand the high strength to weight of such structures that are mostly empty space 25 topology is of further significance in contact mechanics where the dependence of stiffness and friction on the dimensionality of surface structures is the subject of interest with applications in multi-body physics a topological quantum field theory or topological field theory or tqft is a quantum field theory that computes topological invariants although tqfts were invented by physicists they are also of mathematical interest being related to among other things knot theory and the theory of four-manifolds in algebraic topology and to the theory of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry donaldson jones witten and kontsevich have all won fields medals for work related to topological field theory the topological classification of calabi-yau manifolds has important implications in string theory as different manifolds can sustain different kinds of strings 26 in cosmology topology can be used to describe the overall shape of the universe 27 this area of research is commonly known as spacetime topology robotics edit the various possible positions of a robot can be described by a manifold called configuration space 28 in the area of motion planning one finds paths between two points in configuration space these paths represent a motion of the robot s joints and other parts into the desired pose 29 games and puzzles edit tanglement puzzles are based on topological aspects of the puzzle s shapes and components 30 31 32 33 see
