bibliography 17 external links etymology the state of hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island hawai i a common hawaiian explanation of the name of hawai i is that was named for hawai iloa a legendary figure from hawaiian myth he is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled 12 13 the hawaiian language word hawai i is very similar to proto-polynesian sawaiki with the reconstructed meaning homeland 14 cognates of hawai i are found in other polynesian languages including m ori hawaiki rarotongan avaiki and samoan savai i according to linguists pukui and elbert 15 e lsewhere in polynesia hawai i or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home but in hawaii the name has no meaning 16 spelling of state name a somewhat divisive political issue arose in 1978 when the constitution of the state of hawaii added hawaiian as a second official state language 17 the title of the state constitution is the constitution of the state of hawaii article xv section 1 of the constitution uses the state of hawaii 18 diacritics were not used because the document drafted in 1949 19 predates the use of the okina and the kahak in modern hawaiian orthography the exact spelling of the state s name in the hawaiian language is hawai i b in the hawaii admission act that granted hawaiian statehood the federal government recognized hawaii as the official state name official government publications department and office titles and the seal of hawaii use the traditional spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length 20 in contrast the national and state parks services the university of hawai i and some private enterprises implement these symbols no precedent for changes to u s state names exists since the adoption of the united states constitution in 1789 however the constitution of massachusetts formally changed the province of massachusetts bay to the commonwealth of massachusetts in 1780 and in 1819 the territory of arkansaw was created but was later admitted to statehood as the state of arkansas geography and environment there are eight main hawaiian islands seven of which are permanently inhabited

the only u s state that is not geographically located in north america the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago and the only state in which coffee is commercially cultivable in addition to the eight main islands the state has many smaller islands and islets ka ula is a small island near ni ihau the northwest hawaiian islands is a group of nine small older islands to the northwest of kaua i that extend from nihoa to kure atoll these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets such as molokini which are either volcanic marine sedimentary or erosional in origin 32 hawaii s tallest mountain mauna kea is 13,796 ft 4,205 m above mean sea level 33 it is taller than mount everest if measured from the base of the mountain which lies on the floor of the pacific ocean and rises about 33,500 feet 10,200 m 34 geology p hoehoe or smooth lava spills into the pacific ocean forming new rock off the coast of the island of hawaii the hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the hawaii hotspot the process is continuing to build islands the tectonic plate beneath much of the pacific ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary slowly creating new volcanoes because of the hotspot s location all currently active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of hawaii island the newest volcano l ihi seamount is located south of the coast of hawaii island the last volcanic eruption outside hawaii island occurred at haleakal on maui before the late 18th century possibly hundreds of years earlier 35 in 1790 k lauea exploded it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the united states 36 up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on k lauea were killed by the eruption 37 volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features hawaii island has the third-highest point among the world s islands 38 on the flanks of the volcanoes slope instability has generated damaging earthquakes and related tsunamis particularly in 1868 and 1975 39 steep cliffs have been created by catastrophic debris avalanches on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanoes 40 41 flora and fauna corvus hawaiiensis the endemic hawaiian crow alal is extinct in the wild because the islands of hawaii are distant from other land habitats life is thought to have arrived there by wind waves i e by ocean currents and wings i e birds insects and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers this isolation in combination with the diverse environment including extreme altitudes tropical climates and arid shorelines produced an array of endemic flora and fauna hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other u s state 42 one endemic plant brighamia now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct 43 the two species of brighamia b rockii and b insignis are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants to ensure these plants set seed biologists rappel down 3,000-foot 910 m cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas 44 the extant main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for fewer than 10 million years a fraction of the time biological colonization and evolution have occurred there the islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field on a single island the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical less than 20 inches or 510 millimeters annual rainfall to wet tropical on the slopes environments range from tropical rainforest more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimeters per year through a temperate climate to alpine conditions with a cold dry climate the rainy climate impacts soil development which largely determines ground permeability affecting the distribution of streams and wetlands citation needed protected areas french frigate shoals located in the northwestern hawaiian islands is protected as part of the papah naumoku kea marine national monument several areas in hawaii are under the protection of the national park service 45 hawaii has two national parks haleakal national park located near kula on the island of maui which features the dormant volcano haleakal that formed east maui and hawaii volcanoes national park in the southeast region of the hawai i island which includes the active volcano k lauea and its rift zones there are three national historical parks kalaupapa national historical park in kalaupapa moloka i the site of

kea marine national monument was proclaimed by president george w bush on june 15 2006 the monument covers roughly 140,000 square miles 360,000 km2 of reefs atolls and shallow and deep sea out to 50 miles 80 km offshore in the pacific ocean an area larger than all of the national parks in the u s combined 46 climate a true-color satellite view of hawaii shows that most of the vegetation on the islands grows on the northeast sides which face the wind the silver glow around the southwest of the islands is the result of calmer waters 47 hawaii s climate is typical for the tropics although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant trade winds from the east summer highs usually reach around 88 f 31 c during the day with the temperature reaching a low of 75 f 24 c at night winter day temperatures are usually around 83 f 28 c at low elevation they seldom dip below 65 f 18 c at night snow not usually associated with the tropics falls at 13,800 feet 4,200 m on mauna kea and mauna loa on hawaii island in some winter months snow rarely falls on haleakal mount wai ale ale on kaua i has the second-highest average annual rainfall on earth about 460 inches 12,000 mm per year most of hawaii experiences only two seasons the dry season runs from may to october and the wet season is from october to april 48 the warmest temperature recorded in the state in pahala on april 27 1931 is 100 f 38 c making it tied with alaska as the lowest record high temperature observed in a u s state 49 hawaii s record low temperature is 12 f 11 c observed in may 1979 on the summit of mauna kea hawaii is the only state to have never recorded sub-zero fahrenheit temperatures 49 climates vary considerably on each island they can be divided into windward and

kingdom of hawaii provisional government republic of hawaii modern-day hawaii u s territory state of hawaii hawaii portal v t hawaii is one of four u s states apart from the original thirteen along with the vermont republic 1791 the republic of texas 1845 and the california republic 1846 that were independent nations prior to statehood along with texas hawaii had formal international diplomatic recognition as a nation 50 the kingdom of hawai i was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident american and european capitalists and landholders hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until august 12 1898 when it officially became a territory of the united states hawaii was admitted as a u s state on august 21 1959 51 first human settlement ancient hawai i 800 1778 based on archaeological evidence the earliest habitation of the hawaiian islands dates to around 300 ce probably by polynesian settlers from the marquesas islands a second wave of migration from raiatea and bora bora took place in the 11th century the date of the human discovery and habitation of the hawaiian islands is the subject of academic debate 52 some archaeologists and historians think it was a later wave of immigrants from tahiti around 1000 ce who introduced a new line of high chiefs the kapu system the practice of human sacrifice and the building of heiau citation needed this later immigration is detailed in hawaiian mythology mo olelo about pa ao other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of tahitian settlers and that pa ao must be regarded as a myth citation needed the history of the islands is marked by a slow steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms which grew to encompass whole islands local chiefs called ali i ruled their settlements and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals ancient hawaii was a caste-based society much like that of hindus in india 53 european arrival kalani pu u king of hawai i brings presents to captain cook it is possible that spanish explorers arrived in the hawaiian islands in the 16th century 200 years before captain james cook s first documented visit in 1778 ruy l pez de villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left acapulco in 1542 bound for the philippines with a spanish sailor named juan gaetano aboard as pilot depending on the interpretation gaetano s reports describe an encounter with either hawai i or the marshall islands 54 55 better source needed if de villalobos crew spotted hawai i gaetano would be considered the first european to see the islands some scholars have dismissed these claims due to a lack of credibility 56 57 spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as hawai i but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands in this manuscript the island of maui is named la desgraciada the unfortunate island and what appears to be hawai i island is named la mesa the table islands resembling kahoolawe lanai and molokai are named los monjes the monks 58 for two-and-a-half centuries spanish galleons crossed the pacific from mexico along a route that passed south of hawai i on their way to manila the exact route was kept secret to protect the spanish trade monopoly against competing powers the 1778 arrival of british explorer james cook was the first documented contact by a european explorer with hawaii cook named the archipelago as the sandwich islands in honor of his sponsor john montagu 4th earl of sandwich cook published the islands location and rendered the native name as owyhee this spelling lives on in owyhee county idaho it was named after three native hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in that area the owyhee mountains were also named for them 59 king kamehameha receiving otto von kotzebue s russian naval expedition drawing by louis choris in 1816 cook visited the hawaiian islands twice as he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779 a quarrel ensued as cook took temple idols and fencing as firewood 60 and a minor chief and his men took a ship s boat cook abducted the king of hawai i island kalani pu u and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of cook s boat this tactic had worked in tahiti and other islands 61 instead kalani pu u s supporters fought back killing cook and four marines as cook s party retreated along the beach to their ship they departed without the ship s boat after cook s visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages the hawaiian islands attracted many european visitors explorers traders and eventually whalers who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies early british influence can be seen in the design of the flag of hawai i which bears the union jack in the top-left corner these visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands causing the hawaiian population to drop precipitously 62 native hawaiians had no resistance to eurasian diseases such as influenza smallpox and measles by 1820 disease famine and wars between the chiefs killed more than half of the native hawaiian population 63 during the 1850s measles killed a fifth of hawaii s people 64 historical records indicated the earliest chinese immigrants to hawaii originated from guangdong province a few sailors arrived in 1778 with captain cook s journey and more arrived in 1789 with an american trader who settled in hawaii in the late 18th century it appears that leprosy was introduced by chinese workers by 1830 as with the other new infectious diseases it proved damaging to the hawaiians citation needed kingdom of hawai i house of kamehameha kamehameha i conquered the hawaiian islands and established a unified monarchy across the archipelago during the 1780s and 1790s chiefs often fought for power after a series of battles that ended in 1795 all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler who became known as king kamehameha the great he established the house of kamehameha a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872 65 after kamehameha ii inherited the throne in 1819 american protestant missionaries to hawaii converted many hawaiians to christianity they used their influence to end many traditional practices of the people 66 67 during the reign of king kamehameha iii hawai i turned into a christian monarchy with the signing of the 1840 constitution 68 hiram bingham i a prominent protestant missionary was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive american subjects 69 catholic and mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom but they converted a minority of the native hawaiian population 70 71 72 missionaries from each major group administered to the leper colony at kalaupapa on moloka i which was established in 1866 and operated well into the 20th century the best known were father damien and mother marianne cope both of whom were canonized in the early 21st century as roman catholic saints the death of the bachelor king kamehameha v who did not name an heir resulted in the popular election of lunalilo over kal kaua lunalilo died the next year also without naming an heir in 1874 the election was contested within the legislature between kal kaua and emma queen consort of kamehameha iv after riots broke out the united states and britain landed troops on the islands to restore order king kal kaua was chosen as monarch by the legislative assembly by a vote of 39 to 6 on february 12 1874 73 1887 constitution and overthrow preparations in 1887 kal kaua was forced to sign the 1887 constitution of the kingdom of hawaii drafted by white businessmen and lawyers the document stripped the king of much of his authority it established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier white elite resident whites were allowed to vote but resident asians were not as the 1887 constitution was signed under threat of violence it is known as the bayonet constitution king kal kaua reduced to a figurehead reigned until his death in 1891 his sister queen lili uokalani succeeded him she was the last monarch of hawai i 74 in 1893 queen lili uokalani announced plans for a new constitution to proclaim herself an absolute monarch on january 14 1893 a group of mostly euro-american business leaders and residents formed the committee of safety to stage a coup d tat against the kingdom and seek annexation by the united states united states government minister john l stevens responding to a request from the committee of safety summoned a company of u s marines the queen s soldiers did not resist according to historian william russ the monarchy was unable to protect itself 75 overthrow of 1893 the republic of hawaii 1894 1898 queen lili uokalani the last reigning monarch of the hawaiian kingdom the iolani palace in honolulu formerly the residence of the hawaiian monarch was the capitol of the republic of hawaii in january 1893 queen lili uokalani was overthrown and replaced by a provisional government composed of members of the committee of safety lawyer sanford b dole a citizen of hawaii became president of the republic when the provisional government of hawaii ended on july 4 1894 controversy ensued in the following years as the queen tried to regain her throne the administration of president grover cleveland commissioned the blount report which concluded that the removal of lili uokalani had been illegal the u s government first demanded that queen lili uokalani be reinstated but the provisional government refused congress conducted an independent investigation and on february 26 1894 submitted the morgan report which found all parties including minister stevens with the exception of the queen not guilty and not responsible for the coup 76 partisans on both sides of the debate questioned the accuracy and impartiality of both the blount and morgan reports over the events of 1893 75 77 78 79 in 1993 the us congress passed a joint apology resolution regarding the overthrow it was signed by president

of any u s city in 2010 just above that of the silicon valley area of california us 602,000 156 hawaii s very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic u s government trade policy like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year such as areas of california arizona and florida hawaii s residents can be considered to be subject to a sunshine tax this situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well the situation is compounded even further by what could possibly be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in hawaii a u s trade law known as the jones act or the merchant marine act of 1920 this trade regulation prohibits any foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american ports a practice known as cabotage most consumer goods in the united states are manufactured by outsourced labor in east asia then transported by container ships to ports on the u s mainland and hawaii also receives the same goods being located in the central pacific ocean right between major pacific shipping lanes it would be very economical to unload hawaiian-bound goods in honolulu before continuing on to the mainland however this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two american ports because most large cargo ships operate under foreign flags of convenience such as liberia vanuatu or papua new guinea allowing them to avoid the more stringent and thus more costly regulations of developed nations ports the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the jones act instead those cargo ships must proceed directly to the west coast where distributors break bulk and transport the hawaiian-bound asian-manufactured goods back across the ocean by u s -flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50 this highly inefficient system of shipping hawaii s consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average hawaiian citizen and makes the cost of living in hawaii much much higher than it would otherwise be 157 158 hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the jones act this law makes hawaii less competitive than west coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like japan even though prices for asian-manufactured goods should be cheaper because hawaii is much closer than mainland states to asia 159 160 culture the aboriginal culture of hawaii is polynesian hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast polynesian triangle of the south and central pacific ocean while traditional hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern hawaiian society there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands some of these cultural influences including the popularity in greatly modified form of l au and hula are strong enough to affect the wider united states cuisine taro or in hawaiian kalo was one of the primary staples in ancient hawaii and remains a central ingredient in hawaiian gastronomy today the cuisine of hawaii is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the hawaiian islands including the earliest polynesians and native hawaiian cuisine and american chinese filipino japanese korean polynesian and portuguese origins plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in hawaii poi a starch made by pounding taro is one of the traditional foods of the islands many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous plate lunch which features two scoops of rice a simplified version of american macaroni salad and a variety of toppings including hamburger patties a fried egg and gravy of a loco moco
