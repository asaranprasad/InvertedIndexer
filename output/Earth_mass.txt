displaystyle m oplus m l 81.3005678 pm 0.0000027 history of measurement edit the mass of earth is measured indirectly by determining other quantities such as earth s density gravity or gravitational constant using the gm product edit modern methods of determining the mass of earth involve calculating the gravitational coefficient of the earth and dividing by the newtonian constant of gravitation m g m g displaystyle m oplus frac gm oplus g the gm product for the earth is called the geocentric gravitational constant and equals 7005398600441800000 398600.4418 0.0008 km3 s 2 it is determined using laser ranging data from earth-orbiting satellites such as lageos-1 8 9 the gm product can also be calculated by observing the motion of the moon 10 or the period of a pendulum at various elevations these methods are less precise than observations of artificial satellites the uncertainty of the geocentric gravitational constant is just 1 to 7008500000000000000 500000000 however m the mass of the earth in kilograms can be found out only by dividing the gm product by g and g is known only to an uncertainty of 1 to 7003700000000000000 7000 so m will have the same uncertainty for this reason and others astronomers prefer to use the un-reduced gm product rather than mass in kilograms when referencing and comparing planetary objects using the gravitational constant edit earlier efforts after 1798 to determine earth s mass involved measuring g directly as in the cavendish experiment earth s mass could be then found by combining two equations newton s second law and newton s law of universal gravitation citation needed f m a f g m m r 2 displaystyle f ma quad f g frac mm oplus r 2 substituting earth s gravity g for the acceleration term and combining the two equations gives m g g m m r 2 displaystyle mg g frac mm oplus r 2 the equation can then be solved for m m g r 2 g displaystyle m oplus frac gr 2 g with this method the values for earth s surface gravity earth s radius and g were measured empirically using the deflection of a pendulum edit before the cavendish experiment attempts to weigh earth involved estimating the mean density of earth and its volume 11 the volume was well understood through surveying techniques and the density was measured by observing the slight deflection of a pendulum near a mountain as in the schiehallion experiment the earth mass could then be calculated as citation needed m v displaystyle m oplus rho v this technique resulted in a mass estimate that is 20 lower than today s accepted value using the period of a pendulum edit an expedition from 1737 to 1740 by french scientist pierre bouguer attempted to determine the density of earth by measuring the period of a pendulum and therefore the strength of gravity as a function of elevation the experiments were carried out in ecuador and peru on pichincha volcano and mount chimborazo 12 bouguer s work led to an estimate that is two to three times larger than the true mass of earth however this historical determination showed that the earth was not hollow nor filled with water as some had argued at the time 13 modern gravitometers are now used for measuring the local gravitational field they surpass the accuracy limitations of pendulums experiments with pendulums in the nineteenth century edit much later in 1821 francesco carlini determined a density value of 7000438999999999999 4.39 g cm3 through measurements made with pendulums in the milan area this value was refined in 1827 by edward sabine to 7000476999999999999 4.77 g cm3 and then in 1841 by carlo ignazio giulio to 7000495000000000000 4.95 g cm3 on the other hand george biddell airy sought to determine by measuring the difference in the period of a pendulum between the surface and the bottom of a mine 14 the first tests took place in cornwall between 1826 and 1828 the experiment was a failure due to a fire and a flood finally in 1854 airy got the value 7000660000000000000 6.6 g cm3 by measurements in a coal mine in harton sunderland airy s method assumed that the earth had a spherical stratification later in 1883 the experiments conducted by robert von sterneck 1839 to 1910 at different depths in mines of saxony and bohemia provided the average density values between 5.0 and 7000630000000000000 6.3 g cm3 this led to the concept of isostasy which limits the ability to accurately measure by either the deviation from vertical of a plumb line or using pendulums despite the little chance of an accurate estimate of the average density of the earth in this way thomas corwin mendenhall in 1880 realized a gravimetry experiment in tokyo and at the top of mount fuji the result was 7000577000000000000 5.77 g cm3 citation needed variation edit this section may contain

september 2016 earth s mass is constantly changing due to many contributors earth primarily gains mass from micrometeorites and cosmic dust whereas it loses hydrogen and helium gas the combined effect is a net loss of material though the annual mass deficit represents an inconsequential fraction of its total mass a or even the uncertainty in its mass so its inclusion does not affect total mass calculations a number of other mechanisms are responsible for mass adjustments and can be classified into two categories physical transfer of matter and mass that is gained or lost through the absorption or release of energy due to the mass energy equivalence principle several examples are provided for completeness but their relative contribution is negligible net gains edit in-falling material cosmic dust cosmic rays meteors comets etc are the most significant contributor to earth s increase in mass the sum of material is estimated to be 37,000 to 78,000 tons annually 16 17 global warming nasa has calculated that the earth is gaining energy due to rising temperatures it has been estimated that this added energy increases the mass of earth by a tiny amount 160 tonnes per year 18 solar energy conversion minuscule solar energy is converted to chemical energy by photosynthetic pigments as plants construct carbohydrate molecules this stored chemical energy represents in increase in mass most of the chemical energy is reconverted into heat and then lost radiated through chemical processes but some is sequestered and becomes biomass or fossil fuel citation needed artificial photosynthesis minuscule can also theoretically add mass assumed to be negligible but added for sake of completeness citation needed heat conversion probably minuscule some outbound radiation is absorbed within the atmosphere by photosynthetic bacteria and archaea including from chlorophyll f which bind the energy into matter in the form of chemical bonds citation needed net losses edit atmospheric escape of gases about 3 kg s of hydrogen or 95,000 tons per year 19 and 1,600 tons of helium per year 20 are lost through atmospheric escape spacecraft on escape trajectories minuscule spacecraft that are on escape trajectories represent an average mass loss at a rate of 7001650000000000000 65 tons per year 15 earth lost about 3473 tons in the initial 53 years of the space age but the trend is currently decreasing human energy use minuscule human activities conversely reduce earth s mass by liberation of heat that is later radiated into space solar photovoltaics generally do not add to the mass of earth because the energy collected is merely transmitted as electricity or heat and subsequently radiated which is generally not converted into chemical means to be stored on earth in 2010 the human world consumed 550 ej of energy 21 or 6 tons of matter converted into heat then almost entirely lost to space citation needed deceleration of earth s core minuscule as the rotation rate of earth s inner core decelerates it loses rotational kinetic energy which equates to a loss of 16 tons per year citation needed however this rotation speed has been shown to fluctuate over decades 22 non photosynthesizing life forms consume energy and radiate as heat citation needed natural processes probably minuscule events including earthquakes and volcanoes can release energy as well as hydrogen which may be lost as heat or atmospheric escape citation needed radiation losses minuscule from radioisotopes either naturally or through human induced reactions such as nuclear fusion or nuclear fission amount to 16 tons per year 15 additional human impact by induced nuclear fission nuclear fission both for civilian and military purposes greatly speeds up natural process of radiodecay some 59,000 tons of uranium was supplied by mines in 2013 23 the mass of the uranium is reduced as it is converted to energy during the fission reaction see also edit abundance of elements
