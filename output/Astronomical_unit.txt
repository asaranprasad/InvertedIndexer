the astronomical unit symbol au 1 2 3 ua 4 or au is a unit of length roughly the distance from earth to the sun however that distance varies as earth orbits the sun from a maximum aphelion to a minimum perihelion and back again once a year originally conceived as the average of earth s aphelion and perihelion it is since 2012 defined as exactly 7011149597870700000 149597870700 metres about 150 million kilometres or 93 million miles 5 the astronomical unit is used primarily as a convenient yardstick for measuring distances within the solar system or around other stars however it is also

presently in use for the astronomical unit recommended the use of the symbol au 1 in the 2014 revision of the si brochure the bipm used the unit symbol au 3 8 development of unit definition edit earth s orbit around the sun is an ellipse the semi-major axis of this elliptic orbit is defined to be half of the straight line segment that joins the perihelion and aphelion the centre of the sun lies on this straight line segment but not at its midpoint because ellipses are well-understood shapes measuring the points of its extremes defined the exact shape mathematically and made possible calculations for the entire orbit as well as predictions based on observation in addition it mapped out exactly the largest straight-line distance that earth traverses over the course of a year defining times and places for observing the largest parallax apparent shifts of position in nearby stars knowing earth s shift and a star s shift enabled the star s distance to be calculated but all measurements are subject to some degree of error or uncertainty and the uncertainties in the length of the astronomical unit only increased uncertainties in the stellar distances improvements in precision have always been a key to improving astronomical understanding throughout the twentieth century measurements became increasingly precise and sophisticated and ever more dependent on accurate observation of the effects described by einstein s theory of relativity and upon the mathematical tools it used improving measurements were continually checked and cross-checked by means of our understanding of the laws of celestial mechanics which govern the motions of objects in space the expected positions and distances of objects at an established time are calculated in au from these laws and assembled into a collection of data called an ephemeris nasa s jet propulsion laboratory provides one of several ephemeris computation services 9 in 1976 in order to establish a yet more precise measure for the astronomical unit the iau formally adopted a new definition although directly based on the then-best available observational measurements the definition was recast in terms of the then-best mathematical derivations from celestial mechanics and planetary ephemerides it stated that the astronomical unit of length is that length a for which the gaussian gravitational constant k takes the value 6998172020989500000 0.01720209895 when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length mass and time 6 10 11 equivalently by this definition one au is the radius of an unperturbed circular newtonian orbit about the sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass moving with an angular frequency of 6998172020989500000 0.01720209895 radians per day 12 or alternatively that length for which the heliocentric gravitational constant the product gm is equal to 6998172020989500000 0.01720209895 2 au3 d2 when the length is used to describe the positions of objects in the solar system subsequent explorations of the solar system by space probes made it possible to obtain precise measurements of the relative positions of the inner planets and other objects by means of radar and telemetry as with all radar measurements these rely on measuring the time taken for photons to be reflected from an object because all photons move at the speed of light in vacuum a fundamental constant of the universe the distance of an object from the probe is basically the product of the speed of light and the measured time however for precision the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are transiting in addition the measurement of the time itself must be translated to a standard scale that accounts for relativistic time dilation comparison of the ephemeris positions with time measurements expressed in the tdb scale leads to a value for the speed of light in astronomical units per day of 7004864000000000000 86400 s by 2009 the iau had updated its standard measures to reflect improvements and calculated the speed of light at 7008299792458018110 173.1446326847 69 au d tdb 13 in 1983 the international committee for weights and measures cipm modified the international system of units si or modern metric system to make the metre independent of physical objects entirely because other measurements had become too precise for reference to the prototype platinum metre to remain useful instead the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light in vacuum which could be independently determined at need the speed of light could then be expressed exactly as c0 7008299792458000000 299792458 m s a standard also adopted by the iers numerical standards 14 from this definition and the 2009 iau standard the time for light to traverse an au is found to be a 7002499004783806100 499.0047838061 0.00000001 s more than 8 minutes by multiplication the best iau 2009 estimate was a c0 a 7011149597870700000 149597870700 3 m 15 based on a comparison of jpl and iaa ras ephemerides 16 17 18 in 2006 the bipm reported a value of the astronomical unit as 7011149597870691000 1.49597870691 6 1011 m 7 in the 2014 revision of the si brochure the bipm recognised the iau s 2012 redefinition of the astronomical unit as 7011149597870700000 149597870700 m 8 or an increase of 9 meters this estimate was still derived from observation and measurements subject to error and based on techniques that did not yet standardize all relativistic effects and thus were not constant for all observers in 2012 finding that the equalization of relativity alone would make the definition overly complex the iau simply used the 2009 estimate to redefine the astronomical unit as a conventional unit of length directly tied to the metre exactly 7011149597870700000 149597870700 m 15 19 the new definition also recognizes as a consequence that the astronomical unit is now to play a role of reduced importance limited in its use to that of a convenience in some applications 15 1 astronomical unit 7011149597870700000 149597870700 metres exactly 7001929558069999999 92.955807 million miles

2012 the astronomical unit was dependent on the heliocentric gravitational constant that is the product of the gravitational constant g and the solar mass m neither g nor m can be measured to high accuracy separately but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets kepler s third law expressed in terms of newtonian gravitation only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an ephemeris so ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in si units the calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of general relativity in particular time intervals measured on earth s surface terrestrial time tt are not constant when compared to the motions of the planets the terrestrial second tt appears to be longer during the northern hemisphere winter and shorter during the northern hemisphere summer when compared to the planetary second conventionally measured in barycentric dynamical time tdb this is because the distance between earth and the sun is not fixed it varies between 6999983289891200000 0.9832898912 and 7011152097701010286 1.0167103335 au and when earth is closer to the sun perihelion the sun s gravitational field is stronger and earth is moving faster along its orbital path as the metre is defined in terms of the second and the speed of light is constant for all observers the terrestrial metre appears to change in length compared to the planetary metre on a periodic basis the metre is defined to be a unit of proper length but the si definition does not specify the metric tensor to be used in determining it indeed the international committee for weights and measures cipm notes that its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored 20 as such the metre is undefined for the purposes of measuring distances within the solar system the 1976 definition of the astronomical unit was incomplete because it did not specify the frame of reference in which time is to be measured but proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity was proposed 21 and vigorous debate ensued 22 until in august 2012 the iau adopted the current definition of 1 astronomical unit 7011149597870700000 149597870700 metres the astronomical unit is typically used for stellar system scale distances such as the size of a protostellar disk or the heliocentric distance of an asteroid whereas other units are used for other distances in astronomy the astronomical unit is too small to be convenient for interstellar distances where the parsec and light-year are widely used the parsec parallax arcsecond is defined in terms of the astronomical unit being the distance of an object with a parallax of 1 arcsecond the light-year is often used in popular works but is not an approved non-si unit and is rarely used by professional astronomers 23 when simulating a numerical model of the solar system the astronomical unit provides an appropriate scale that minimizes overflow underflow and truncation errors in floating point calculations history edit according to archimedes in the sandreckoner 2.1 aristarchus of samos estimated the distance to the sun to be 7004100000000000000 10000 times earth s radius the true value is about 7004230000000000000 23000 24 however the book on the sizes and distances of the sun and moon which has long been ascribed to aristarchus says that he calculated the distance to the sun to be between 18 and 20 times the distance to the moon whereas the true ratio is about 389.174 the latter estimate was based on the angle between the half moon and the sun which he estimated as 87 the true value being close to 89.853 depending on the distance that van helden assumes aristarchus used for the distance to the moon his calculated distance to the sun would fall between 380 and 7003152000000000000 1520 earth radii 25 according to eusebius of caesarea in the praeparatio evangelica book xv chapter 53 eratosthenes found the distance to the sun to be literally of stadia myriads 400 and 7004800000000000000 80000 but with the additional note that in the greek text the grammatical agreement is between myriads not stadia on the one hand and both 400 and 7004800000000000000 80000 on the other as in greek unlike english all three or all four if one were to include stadia words are inflected this has been translated either as 7006408000000000000 4080000 stadia 1903 translation by edwin hamilton gifford or as 7008804000000000000 804000000 stadia edition of des places dated 1974 1991 using the greek stadium of 185 to 190 metres 26 27 the former translation comes to 7008754800000000000 754800 km to 7008775200000000000 775200 km which is far too low whereas the second translation comes to 148.7 to 152.8 million kilometres accurate within 2 28 hipparchus also gave an estimate of the distance of earth from the sun quoted by pappus as equal to 490 earth radii according to the conjectural reconstructions of noel swerdlow and g j toomer this was derived from his assumption of a least perceptible solar parallax of 7 arc minutes 29 a chinese mathematical treatise the zhoubi suanjing c 1st century bce shows how the distance to the sun can be computed geometrically using the different lengths of the noontime shadows observed at three places 7003100000000000000 1000 li apart and the assumption that earth is

1.0000 in the 2nd century ce ptolemy estimated the mean distance of the sun as 7003121000000000000 1210 times earth s radius 31 32 to determine this value ptolemy started by measuring the moon s parallax finding what amounted to a horizontal lunar parallax of 1 26 which was much too large he then derived a maximum lunar distance of 641 6 earth radii because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure his theory of the moon s orbit and other factors this figure was approximately correct 33 34 he then measured the apparent sizes of the sun and the moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the moon at the moon s greatest distance and from records of lunar eclipses he estimated this apparent diameter as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of earth traversed by the moon during a lunar eclipse given these data the distance of the sun from earth can be trigonometrically computed to be 7003121000000000000 1210 earth radii this gives a ratio of solar to lunar distance of approximately 19 matching aristarchus s figure although ptolemy s procedure is theoretically workable it is very sensitive to small changes in the data so much so that changing a measurement by a few percent can make the solar distance infinite 33 after greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval islamic world astronomers made some changes to ptolemy s cosmological model but did not greatly change his estimate of the earth sun distance for example in his introduction to ptolemaic astronomy al-fargh n gave a mean solar distance of 7003117000000000000 1170 earth radii whereas in his zij al-batt n used a mean solar distance of 7003110800000000000 1108 earth radii subsequent astronomers such as al-b r n used similar values 35 later in europe copernicus and tycho brahe also used comparable figures 7003114200000000000 1142 and 7003115000000000000 1150 earth radii and so ptolemy s approximate earth sun distance survived through the 16th century 36 johannes kepler was the first to realize that ptolemy s estimate must be significantly too low according to kepler at least by a factor of three in his rudolphine tables 1627 kepler s laws of planetary motion allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the sun and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for earth which could then be applied to the other planets the invention of the telescope allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye flemish astronomer godefroy wendelin repeated aristarchus measurements in 1635 and found that ptolemy s value was too low by a factor of at least eleven a somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the transit of venus 37 by measuring the transit in two different locations one can accurately calculate the parallax of venus and from the relative distance of earth and venus from the sun the solar parallax which cannot be measured directly 38 jeremiah horrocks had attempted to produce an estimate based on his observation of the 1639 transit published in 1662 giving a solar parallax of 15 arcseconds similar to wendelin s figure the solar parallax is related to the earth sun distance as measured in earth radii by a cot displaystyle a cot alpha the smaller the solar parallax the greater the distance between the sun and earth a solar parallax of 15 is equivalent to an earth sun distance of 7004137500000000000 13750 earth radii christiaan huygens believed that the distance was even greater by comparing the apparent sizes of venus and mars he estimated a value of about 7004240000000000000 24000 earth radii 39 equivalent to a solar parallax of 8.6 although huygens estimate is remarkably close to modern values it is often discounted by historians of astronomy because of the many unproven and incorrect assumptions he had to make for his method to work the accuracy of his value seems to be based more on luck than good measurement with his various errors cancelling each other out transits of venus across the face of the sun were for a long time the best method of measuring the astronomical unit despite the difficulties here the so-called black drop effect and the rarity of observations jean richer and giovanni domenico cassini measured the parallax of mars between paris and cayenne in french guiana when mars was at its closest to earth in 1672 they arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of 91 2 equivalent to an earth sun distance of about 7004220000000000000 22000 earth radii they were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of earth which had been measured by their colleague jean picard in 1669 as 7003326900000000000 3269 thousand toises another colleague ole r mer discovered the finite speed of light in 1676 the speed was so great that it was usually quoted as the time required for light to travel from the sun to the earth or light time per unit distance a convention that is still followed by astronomers today a better method for observing venus transits was devised by james gregory and published in his optica promata 1663 it was strongly advocated by edmond halley 40 and was applied to the transits of venus observed in 1761 and 1769 and then again in 1874 and 1882 transits of venus occur in pairs but less than one pair every century and observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation despite the seven years war dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger several of them died in the endeavour 41 the various results were collated by j r me lalande to give a figure for the solar parallax of 8.6 date method a gm uncertainty 1895 aberration 149.25 0.12 1941 parallax 149.674 0.016 1964 radar 149.5981 0.001 1976 telemetry 149.597 870 0.000 001 2009 telemetry 149.597 870 700 0.000 000 003 another method involved determining the constant of aberration simon newcomb gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80 for the solar parallax close to the modern value of 7000879414300000000 8.794143 although newcomb also used data from the transits of venus newcomb also collaborated with a a michelson to measure the speed of light with earth-based equipment combined with the constant of aberration which is related to the light time per unit distance this gave the first direct measurement of the earth sun distance in kilometres newcomb s value for the solar parallax and for the constant of aberration and the gaussian gravitational constant were incorporated into the first international system of astronomical constants in 1896 42 which remained in place for the calculation of ephemerides until 1964 43 the name astronomical unit appears first to have been used in 1903 44 the discovery of the near-earth asteroid 433 eros and its passage near earth in 1900 1901 allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement 45 another international project to measure the parallax of 433 eros was undertaken in 1930 1931 38 46 direct radar measurements of the distances to venus and mars became available in the early 1960s along with improved measurements of the speed of light these showed that newcomb s values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another 47 developments edit the astronomical unit is used as the baseline of the triangle to measure stellar parallaxes distances in the image are not to scale the unit distance a the value of the astronomical unit in metres can be expressed in terms of other astronomical constants a 3 g m d 2 k 2 displaystyle a 3 frac gm odot d 2 k 2 where g is the newtonian gravitational constant m is the solar mass k is the numerical value of gaussian gravitational constant and d is the time period of one day the sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy 48 so the orbits of the planets are steadily expanding outward from the sun this has led to calls to abandon the astronomical unit as a unit of measurement 49 as the speed of light has an exact defined value in si units and the gaussian gravitational constant k is fixed in the astronomical system of units measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product gm in si units hence it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in si units which is increasingly becoming the norm a 2004 analysis of radiometric measurements in the inner solar system suggested that the secular increase in the unit distance was much larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation 7001150000000000000 15 4 metres per century 50 51 the measurements of the secular variations of the astronomical unit are not confirmed by other authors and are quite controversial furthermore since 2010 the astronomical unit is not yet estimated by the planetary ephemerides 52 examples edit the following table contains some distances given in astronomical units it includes some examples with distances that are normally not given in
