heavier-than-air flight these activities were led principally by john montgomery and his peers the city of san jose has established montgomery park a monument at san felipe and yerba buena roads and

a p dutch hamann led the city in a major growth campaign the city annexed adjacent areas such as alviso and cambrian park providing large areas for suburbs an anti-growth reaction to the effects of rapid development emerged in the 1970s championed by mayors norman mineta and janet gray hayes despite establishing an urban growth boundary development fees and the incorporations of campbell and cupertino development was not slowed but rather directed into already-incorporated areas 58 the 1928 san jose annual fiesta de las rosas parade in downtown on april 3 1979 the san jose city council adopted san jos with the diacritical mark on the e as the spelling of the city name on the city seal official stationery office titles and department names 61 also by city council convention this spelling of san jos is used when the name is stated in mixed upper- and lower-case letters but not when the name is stated only in upper-case letters the accent reflects the spanish version of the name and the dropping of accents in all-capital writing was typical in spanish while san jos is commonly spelled both with and without the acute accent over the e the city s official guidelines indicate that it should be spelled with the accent most of the time and sets forth narrow exceptions such as when the spelling is in urls when the name appears in all-capital letters when the name is used on social media sites where the diacritical mark does not render properly and where san jose is part of the proper name of another organization or business such as san jose silicon valley chamber of commerce that has chosen not to use the accent-marked name 62 63 the city s name without the accent can still be found in its 1965 charter document as amended which formally chartered the municipality as city of san jose 64 similarly the city s website appears to use a mixture of both for example the city of san jos in the text uses the mark but the city of san jose logo image does not 65 san jose s position in silicon valley triggered further economic and population growth results from the 1990 u s census indicated that san jose surpassed san francisco as the most populous city in the bay area for the first time 25 this growth led to the highest housing-cost increase in the nation 936 between 1976 and 2001 66 efforts to increase density continued into the 1990s when an update of the 1974 urban plan kept the urban growth boundaries intact and voters rejected a ballot measure to ease development restrictions in the foothills sixty percent of the housing built in san jose

manager from 1950 to 1969 during his administration with his staff referred to as dutch s panzer division the city annexed property 1,389 times 69 growing the city from 17 to 149 square miles 44 to 386 km2 70 absorbing the communities named above changing their status to neighborhoods they say san jos is going to become another los angeles believe me i m going to do everything in my power to make that come true dutch hamann 1965 71 sales taxes were a chief source of revenue hamann would determine where major shopping areas would be and then annex narrow bands of land along major roadways leading to those locations pushing tentacles across the santa clara valley and in turn walling off the expansion of adjacent communities 72 during his reign it was said the city council would vote according to hamann s nod in 1963 the state of california imposed local agency formation commissions statewide but largely to try to maintain order with san jose s aggressive growth eventually the political forces against growth grew as local neighborhoods bonded together to elect their own candidates ending hamann s influence and leading to his resignation 73 while the job was not complete the trend was set the city had defined its sphere of influence in all directions sometimes chaotically leaving unincorporated pockets to be swallowed up by the behemoth sometimes even at the objection of the residents 69 topography edit a satellite image of the santa clara valley in the south bay area san jose makes up most of the urbanization in the center of the valley the guadalupe river runs from

ocean and close to san francisco bay a small portion of its northern border touches the bay santa clara valley is the population center of the bay area and like the hub and spokes of a wheel surrounding communities emanate outwards from the valley this growth in part has shaped the greater bay area as it is today in terms of geographic population distribution and the trend of suburbanization away from the valley citation needed there are four distinct valleys in the city of san jose almaden valley situated on the southwest fringe of the city evergreen valley to the
