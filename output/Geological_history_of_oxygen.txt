for instance the appearance of flying competitors such as pterosaurs birds and bats 9 rising oxygen concentrations have been cited as one of several drivers for evolutionary diversification although the physiological arguments behind such arguments are questionable and a consistent pattern between oxygen concentrations and the rate of evolution is not clearly evident 9 the most celebrated link between oxygen and evolution occurs at the end of the last of the snowball glaciations where complex multicellular life is first found in the fossil record under low oxygen concentrations and before the evolution of nitrogen fixation biologically-available nitrogen compounds were in limited supply 13 and periodic nitrogen crises could render the ocean inhospitable to life 9 significant concentrations of oxygen were just one of the prerequisites for the evolution of complex life 9 models based on uniformitarian principles i e extrapolating present-day ocean dynamics into deep time suggest that such a concentration was only reached immediately before metazoa first appeared in the fossil record 9 further anoxic or otherwise chemically nasty oceanic conditions that resemble those supposed to inhibit macroscopic life re-occur at intervals through the early cambrian and also in the late cretaceous with no apparent effect on lifeforms at these times 9 this might suggest that the geochemical signatures found in ocean sediments reflect the atmosphere in a different way before the cambrian - perhaps as a result of the fundamentally different mode of nutrient cycling in the absence of planktivory 7 9 oxygen in the atmosphere can cause phosphorus and iron to be freed from rock and these elements can then be used for building new species which require these elements 2 references edit http rstb royalsocietypublishing org content 361 1470 903 full pdf a b zimmer carl 3 october 2013 new york times retrieved 3 october 2013 dutkiewicz a volk h george s c ridley j buick r 2006 biomarkers from huronian oil-bearing fluid inclusions an uncontaminated record of life before the great oxidation event geology 34 6 437 bibcode doi anbar a duan y lyons t arnold g kendall b creaser r kaufman a gordon g scott c garvin j buick r 2007 a whiff of oxygen before the great oxidation event science 317 5846 1903 1906 bibcode doi pmid dole m 1965 the journal of general physiology 49 1 suppl supp5 27 doi pmc pmid frei r gaucher c poulton s w canfield d e 2009 fluctuations in precambrian atmospheric oxygenation recorded by chromium isotopes nature 461 7261 250 253 bibcode doi pmid a b butterfield n j 2007 macroevolution and macroecology through deep time palaeontology 50 1 41 55 doi freeman scott 2005 biological science 2nd upper saddle river nj pearson prentice hall pp 214 586 isbn 0-13-140941-7 a b c d e f g h i j k l butterfield n j 2009 oxygen animals and oceanic ventilation an alternative view geobiology 7 1 1 7 doi pmid berner r a sep 1999 free full text proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america 96 20 10955 10957 bibcode doi issn pmc pmid emsley john 2001 oxygen nature s building blocks an a-z guide to the elements oxford england uk oxford university press pp 297 304 isbn 0-19-850340-7 j b s haldane in on being the right size paragraph 7 navarro-gonz lez rafaell mckay christopher p nna mvondo delphine jul 2001 a possible nitrogen crisis for archaean life due to reduced nitrogen fixation by lightning nature 412 5 july 2001 61 64 doi pmid external links edit subscription required new scientist 2746 5 february 2010 by nick lane new york times 3 october 2013 by carl zimmer joseph henry press isbn 0-309-10061-5 2006 by peter d ward retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title geological history of oxygen oldid 817107111 categories oxygen hidden categories all articles with unsourced statements articles with unsourced statements from june 2015 articles with unsourced statements from may 2014 pages containing links to subscription-only content navigation menu search this page was last edited on 26 december 2017 at 05 29 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
