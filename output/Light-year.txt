about 9.5 trillion kilometres or 5.9 trillion miles note 1 as defined by the international astronomical union iau a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one julian year 365.25 days 2 because it includes the word year the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time as a year is a unit of time equivalent to approximately 365 days the light-year is most often used when expressing distances to stars and other distances on a galactic scale especially in nonspecialist and popular science publications the unit usually used in professional astrometry is the parsec symbol pc about 3.26 light-years the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one second of arc 2 contents 1 definitions 2 history 3 usage of term 4 related units 5 see also

successful measurement of the distance to a star other than the sun by friedrich bessel in 1838 the star was 61 cygni and he used a 6.2-inch 160 mm heliometer designed by joseph von fraunhofer the largest unit for expressing distances across space at that time was the astronomical unit equal to the radius of the earth s orbit 7011150000000000000 1.50 108 km or 7011149668992000000 9.30 107 mi in those terms trigonometric calculations based on 61 cygni s parallax of 0.314 arcseconds showed the distance to the star to be 7005660000000000000 660000 astronomical units 7016990000000000000 9.9 1013 km or 7016981699840000000 6.1 1013 mi bessel added that light employs 10.3 years to traverse this distance 17 he recognized that his readers would enjoy the mental picture of the approximate transit time for light but he refrained from using the light-year as a unit he may have resented expressing distances in light-years because it would deteriorate the accuracy of his parallax data due to multiplying with the uncertain parameter of the speed of light the speed of light was not yet precisely known in 1838 its value changed in 1849 fizeau and 1862 foucault it was not yet considered to be a fundamental constant of nature and the propagation of light through the aether or space was still enigmatic the light-year unit appeared however in 1851 in a german popular astronomical article by otto ule 18 the paradox of a distance unit name ending on year was explained by ule by comparing it to a hiking road hour wegstunde a contemporary german popular astronomical book also noticed that light-year is an odd name 19 in 1868 an english journal labelled the light-year as a unit used by the germans 20 eddington called the light-year an inconvenient and irrelevant unit which had sometimes crept from popular use into technical investigations 21 although modern astronomers often prefer to use the parsec light years are also popularly used to gauge the expanses of interstellar and intergalactic space usage of term edit distances expressed in light-years include those between stars in the same general area such as those belonging to the same spiral arm or globular cluster

universe misconceptions for why this is possible related units edit distances between objects within a star system tend to be small fractions of a light year and are usually expressed in astronomical units however smaller units of length can similarly be formed usefully by multiplying units of time by the speed of light for example the light-second useful in astronomy telecommunications and relativistic physics is exactly 7008299792458000000 299792458 metres or 1 7007315576000000000 31557600 of a light-year units such as the light-minute light-hour and light-day are sometimes used in popular science publications the light-month roughly one-twelfth of a light-year is also used occasionally for approximate measures 31 32 the hayden planetarium specifies the light month more precisely as 30 days of light travel time 33 light travels approximately one foot in a nanosecond the term light-foot is sometimes used as an informal measure of time 34 see also edit listen to this
