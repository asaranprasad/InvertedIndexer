https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounding_rocket sounding rocket from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a black brant xii being launched from wallops flight facility a sounding rocket sometimes called a research rocket is an instrument-carrying rocket designed to take measurements and perform scientific experiments during its sub-orbital flight the rockets are used to carry instruments from 50 to 1,500 kilometres 31 to 932 mi 1 above the surface of the earth the altitude generally between weather balloons and satellites the maximum altitude for balloons is about 40 kilometres 25 mi and the minimum for satellites is approximately 120 kilometres 75 mi 2 certain sounding rockets such as the black brant x and xii have an apogee between 1,000 and 1,500 kilometres 620 and 930 mi the maximum apogee of their class sounding rockets often use military surplus rocket motors 3 nasa routinely flies the terrier mk 70 boosted improved orion lifting 270 450-kilogram 600 990 lb payloads into the exoatmospheric region between 100 and 200 kilometres 62 and 124 mi 4 contents 1 etymology 2 design 3 advantages 4 research applications 5 operators and programs 6 see also 7 references 8 external links etymology edit the origin of the term comes from nautical vocabulary to sound which is to throw a weighted line from a ship into the water to measure the water s depth the term itself has its etymological roots in the portuguese italian spanish and french words for probe which are sonda and sonde respectively sounding in the rocket context is equivalent to taking a measurement 3 design edit sample payloads for sounding rockets the basic elements of sounding rocket are a solid-fuel rocket motor and a science payload 3 larger higher altitude rockets have 2 to 3 stages to increase efficiency and payload capability the freefall part of the flight is an elliptic trajectory with vertical major axis allowing the payload to appear to hover near its apogee 2 the average flight time is less than 30 minutes usually between five and 20 minutes 2 the rocket consumes its fuel on the first stage of the rising part of the flight then separates and falls away leaving the payload to complete the arc and return to the ground under a parachute 3 advantages edit sounding rockets are advantageous for some research because of their low cost 2 short lead time sometimes less than six months 3 and their ability to conduct research in areas inaccessible to either balloons or satellites they are also used as test beds for equipment that will be used in more expensive and risky orbital spaceflight missions 2 the smaller size of a sounding rocket also makes launching from temporary sites possible allowing for field studies at remote locations and even in the middle of the ocean if fired from a ship 5 research applications edit sounding rockets are commonly used for research in aeronomy which requires this tool for in situ measurements in the upper atmosphere ultraviolet and x-ray astronomy which require being above the bulk of the earth s atmosphere microgravity research which benefits from a few minutes of weightlessness on rockets launched to altitudes of a few hundred kilometers operators and programs edit and ya space center in norway operates two sounding rocket launch sites one at and ya and one at svalbard has launched sounding rockets since 1962 poker flat research range is owned by the university of alaska fairbanks the british skylark rocket was first designed in 1955 and was used for 441 launches before it was terminated in 2005 isro s vssc developed the rohini sounding rockets series starting in 1967 that reached altitudes of 500 km the australian space research institute asri operates a small sounding rocket program ssrp for launching payloads mostly educational to altitudes of about 7 km indian institute of space science and technology iist launched a sounding rocket vyom in may 2012 which reached an altitude of 15 km vyom mk-ii is in its conceptual design stage with an objective to reach 70 km altitude with 20 kg payload capacity the university of queensland operates terrier-orion sounding rockets capable of reaching altitudes in excess of 300 km as part of their hyshot hypersonics research iranian space agency operated its first sounding rocket in february 2007 up aerospace operates the spaceloft xl

jaxa operates the sounding rockets s-series s-310 s-520 ss-520 new zealand company rocket lab is developing the highly adaptable atea series of sounding rockets to carry 5 70 kg payloads to altitudes of 250 km or greater the meteor rockets were built in poland between 1963 and 1974 the kartika i rocket was built and launched in indonesia by lapan on 1964 becoming the second sounding rocket in asia after japan the soviet union developed an extensive program using rockets such as the m-100 the most used ever its successor by its successor state russia is the mr-20 and later the mr-30 brazil has been launching its own sounding rockets since 1965 the largest and most current family of rocket are the sonda rockets which are the r d basis for brazil s soon-to-be-launched vls satellite launcher
