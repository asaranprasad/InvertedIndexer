https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt axial tilt from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in astronomy axial tilt also known as obliquity is the angle between an object s rotational axis and its orbital axis or equivalently the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane 1 it differs from orbital inclination at an obliquity of zero the two axes point in the same direction i e the rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane earth s obliquity oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees 2 on a 41,000-year cycle the earth s mean obliquity is currently 23 26 12.9 or 23.43693 and decreasing over the course of an orbit the obliquity usually does not change considerably and the orientation of the axis remains the same relative to the background stars this causes one pole to be directed more toward the sun on one side of the orbit and the other pole on the other side the cause of the seasons on the earth contents 1 standards 2 earth 2.1 history 2.2

the right-hand rule if the fingers of the right hand are curled in the direction of the rotation then the thumb points to the positive pole the axial tilt is defined as the angle between the direction of the positive pole and the normal to the orbital plane the angles for earth uranus and venus are approximately 23 97 and 177 respectively there are two standard methods of specifying tilt the international astronomical union iau defines the north pole of a planet as that which lies on earth s north side of the invariable plane of the solar system 3 under this system venus is tilted 3 and spins retrograde opposite that of most of the other planets 4 5 the iau also uses the right-hand rule to define a positive pole 6 for the purpose of determining orientation using this convention venus is tilted 177 upside down earth edit earth s axial tilt obliquity is currently about 23.4 earth s orbital plane is known as the ecliptic plane and earth s tilt is known to astronomers as the obliquity of the ecliptic being the angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator on the celestial sphere 7 it is denoted by the greek letter earth currently has an axial tilt of about 23.4 8 this value remains about the same relative to a stationary orbital plane throughout the cycles of axial precession 9 but the ecliptic i e earth s orbit moves due to planetary perturbations and the obliquity of the ecliptic is not a fixed quantity at present it is decreasing at a rate of about 47 per century see details in short term below history edit earth s obliquity may have been reasonably accurately measured as early as 1100 bc in india and china 10 the ancient greeks had good measurements of the obliquity since about 350 bc when pytheas of marseilles measured the shadow of a gnomon at the summer solstice 11 about 830 ad the caliph al-mamun of baghdad directed his astronomers to measure the obliquity and the result was used in the arab world for many years 12 in 1437 ulugh beg determined the earth s axial tilt as 23 30 17 23.5047 13 it was widely believed during the middle ages that both precession and earth s obliquity oscillated around a mean value with a period of 672 years an idea known as trepidation of the equinoxes perhaps the first to realize this was incorrect during historic time was ibn al-shatir in the fourteenth century 14 and the first to realize that the obliquity is decreasing at a relatively constant rate was fracastoro in 1538 15 the first accurate modern western observations of the obliquity were probably those of tycho brahe from denmark about 1584 16 although observations by several others including al-ma mun al-tusi 17 purbach regiomontanus and walther could have provided similar information seasons edit earth s axis remains tilted in the same direction with reference to the background stars throughout a year regardless of where it is in its orbit this means that one pole and the associated hemisphere of earth will be directed away from the sun at one side of the orbit and half an orbit later half a year later this pole will be directed towards the sun this is the cause of earth s seasons summer occurs in the northern hemisphere when the north pole is directed toward the sun variations in earth s axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long-term climate change also see milankovitch cycles relationship between earth s axial tilt to the tropical and polar circles oscillation edit short term edit obliquity of the ecliptic for 20,000 years from laskar 1986 the red point represents the year 2000 the exact angular value of the obliquity is found by observation of the motions of earth and planets over many years astronomers produce new fundamental ephemerides as the accuracy of observation improves and as the understanding of the dynamics increases and from these ephemerides various astronomical values including the obliquity are derived annual almanacs are published listing the derived values and methods of use until 1983 the astronomical almanac s angular value of the mean obliquity for any date was calculated based on the work of newcomb who analyzed positions of the planets until about 1895

these expressions are for the so-called mean obliquity that is the obliquity free from short-term variations periodic motions of the moon and of earth in its orbit cause much smaller 9.2 arcseconds short-period about 18.6 years oscillations of the rotation axis of earth known as nutation which add a periodic component to earth s obliquity 22 23 the true or instantaneous obliquity includes this nutation 24 long term edit using numerical methods to simulate solar system behavior long-term changes in earth s orbit and hence its obliquity have been investigated over a period of several million years for the past 5 million years earth s obliquity has varied between 22 2 33 and 24 30 16 with a mean period of 41,040 years this cycle is a combination of precession and the largest term in the motion of the ecliptic for the next 1 million years the cycle will carry the obliquity between 22 13 44 and 24 20 50 25 the moon has a stabilizing effect on earth s obliquity frequency map analysis conducted in 1993 suggested that in the absence of the moon the obliquity can change rapidly due to orbital resonances and chaotic behavior of the solar system reaching as high as 90 in as little as a few million years also see orbit of the moon 26 27 however more recent numerical simulations 28 made in 2011 indicated that even in the absence of the moon earth s obliquity might not be quite so unstable varying only by about 20 25 to resolve this contradiction diffusion rate of obliquity has been calculated and it was found that it takes more than billions of years for earth s obliquity to reach near 90 29 the moon s stabilizing effect will continue for less than 2 billion years as the moon continues to recede from earth due to tidal acceleration resonances may occur which will cause large oscillations of the obliquity 30 long-term obliquity of the ecliptic left for the past 5 million years note that the obliquity varies only from about 22.0 to 24.5 right for the next 1 million years note the approx 41,000-year period of variation in both graphs the red point represents the year 1850 source berger 1976 solar system bodies edit all four of the innermost rocky planets of the solar system may have had large variations of their obliquity in the past since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets but the axis of rotation can also move axial precession due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet s equatorial bulge like earth all of the rocky planets show axial precession if the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes 31 the rate varies due to tidal dissipation and core-mantle interaction among other things when a planet s precession rate approaches certain values orbital resonances may cause large changes in obliquity the amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate so it becomes large when the two are similar 31 mercury and venus have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the sun earth was stabilized by the moon as mentioned above but before its capture earth too could have passed through times of instability mars s obliquity is quite variable over millions of years and may be in a chaotic state it varies as much as 0 to 60 over some millions of years depending on perturbations of the planets 26 32 some authors dispute that mars s obliquity is chaotic and show that tidal dissipation and viscous core-mantle coupling are adequate for it to have reached a fully damped state similar to mercury and venus 4 33 the occasional shifts in the axial tilt of mars have been suggested as an explanation for the appearance and disappearance of rivers and lakes over the course of the existence of mars a shift could cause a burst of methane into the atmosphere causing warming but then the methane would be destroyed and the climate would become arid again 34 35 the obliquities of the outer planets are considered

tidal theories to predict the obliquity of extrasolar planets it has been shown that the obliquities of exoplanets in the habitable zone around low-mass stars tend to be eroded in less than 109 years
