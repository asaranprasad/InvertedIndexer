https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum solar maximum from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the current prediction for sunspot cycle 24 gives a smoothed sunspot number maximum of about 66 in the summer of 2013 the smoothed sunspot number has already reached 67 in february 2012 due to the strong peak in late 2011 so the official maximum will be at least this high the smoothed sunspot number has been flat over the last four months we are currently over four years into cycle 24 the current predicted and observed size makes this the smallest sunspot cycle since cycle 14 which had a maximum of 64.2 in february 1906 solar maximum or solar max is a regular period of greatest sun activity during the 11-year solar cycle during solar maximum large numbers of sunspots appear and the solar irradiance output grows by about 0.07 1 the increased energy output of solar maxima can impact earth s global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns citation needed at solar maximum the sun s magnetic field lines are the most distorted due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles citation needed on average the solar cycle takes about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next with duration observed varying from 9 to 14 years three recent solar cycles large solar flares often occur during a maximum for example the solar storm of 1859 struck the earth with such intensity that the northern lights were visible as far from the poles as cuba and hawaii 2 contents 1 predictions 2 film 3 grand solar minima and maxima 4 see also 5 references predictions edit predictions of a future maximum s timing and strength are very difficult predictions vary widely there was a solar maximum in 2000 in 2006 nasa initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011 and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958 3 however the solar maximum was not declared to have occurred until 2014 and even then was ranked among the weakest on record 4 film edit imax documentary about solar maximum called solarmax 5 x class corona mass ejection 2012-07-14 documentary grand solar minima and maxima edit grand solar maxima occur when several solar cycles exhibit greater than average activity for decades or centuries solar cycles still occur during these grand solar maximum periods but the intensity of those cycles is greater grand solar maxima have shown some correlation with global and regional climate changes 400 year history of sunspot numbers solar minimum events and approximate dates event start end homeric minimum 6 950bc 800bc oort minimum see medieval warm period 1040 1080 medieval maximum see medieval warm period 1100 1250 wolf minimum 1280 1350 sp rer minimum 1450 1550 maunder minimum 1645 1715 dalton minimum 1790 1820 modern maximum 1900 present the idea of a modern maximum has now been thrown into question with the release of a paper at the international astronomical union general assembly in august 2015 7 a list of historical grand minima of solar activity 8 includes also grand minima ca 690 ad 360 bc 770 bc 1390 bc 2860 bc 3340 bc 3500 bc 3630 bc 3940 bc 4230 bc 4330 bc 5260 bc 5460 bc 5620 bc 5710 bc 5990 bc 6220 bc 6400 bc 7040 bc 7310 bc 7520 bc 8220 bc 9170 bc see also edit solar wind solar variation solar minimum list of solar cycles table of solar cycles solar maximum mission references edit c d camp k k tung 2007 pdf geophysical research letters 34 l14703 bibcode doi retrieved 20 january 2012 bbc news 14 may 2013 retrieved 2015-01-06 science nasa 10 march 2006 accessed 26 mar 2010 nasa retrieved 2014-12-24 imdb seattle wa usa amazon com inc retrieved august 6 2012 celia martin-puertas katja matthes achim brauer raimund muscheler et al april 2 2012 nature geoscience 5 6 397 401 bibcode doi press release iau 7 aug 2015 1508 usoskin ilya g solanki sami k kovaltsov gennady a 2007 pdf astron astrophys 471 1 301 9 arxiv bibcode doi retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title solar maximum oldid 790690835 categories solar phenomena hidden categories all articles with unsourced statements articles with unsourced statements from november 2013 articles with unsourced statements from june 2011 navigation menu search this page was last edited on 15 july 2017 at 12 39 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
