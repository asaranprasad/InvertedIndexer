research station in inland princess elizabeth land antarctica founded by the soviet union in 1957 the station lies at the southern pole of cold with the lowest reliably measured natural temperature on earth of 89.2 c 128.6 f 184.0 k 1 research includes ice core drilling and magnetometry vostok russian for east was named after vostok the lead ship of the first russian antarctic expedition captained by fabian von bellingshausen the second ship mirny captained by mikhail lazarev became the namesake for mirny station contents 1 description 2 history 2.1 historic monuments 3 climate 4 ice core drilling 5 see also 6 references 7 external links description edit vostok research station is about 1,300 km 800 mi from the geographic south pole at the center of the east antarctic ice sheet vostok is located near the southern pole of inaccessibility and the south geomagnetic pole making it one of the optimal places to observe changes in the earth s magnetosphere other studies include actinometry geophysics medicine and climatology the station is at 3,488 metres 11,444 ft above sea level and is one of the most isolated established research stations on the antarctic continent 2 the station was supplied from mirny station on the antarctic coast 3 the station typically contains 25 scientists and engineers in the summer in winter their number drops to 13 4 the only permanent research station located farther south is the amundsen scott south pole station operated by the united states at the geographic south pole the chinese kunlun station is farther south than vostok but only occupied during summers some of the challenges faced by those living on the station were described in vladimir sanin s books such as newbie in the antarctic 1973 72 degrees below zero 1975 and others history edit ice cores drilled at vostok with a portion of the station behind vostok station was established on 16 december 1957 during the international geophysical year by the 2nd soviet antarctic expedition and was operated year-round for more than 37 years 5 the station was temporarily closed from february to november 1994 5 in 1974 when british scientists in antarctica performed an airborne ice-penetrating radar survey and detected strange radar readings at the site the presence of a liquid freshwater lake below the ice did not instantly spring to mind 6 in 1991 jeff ridley a remote-sensing specialist with the mullard space science laboratory at university college london directed a european satellite called ers-1 to turn its high-frequency array toward the center of the antarctic ice cap it confirmed the 1974 discovery 7 but it was not until 1993 that the discovery was published in the journal of glaciology space-based radar revealed that the sub-glacial body of fresh water was one of the largest lakes in the world and one of some 140 subglacial lakes in antarctica russian and british scientists delineated the lake in 1996 by integrating a variety of data including airborne ice-penetrating radar imaging observations and spaceborne radar altimetry lake vostok lies some 4,000 meters 13,000 ft below the surface of the central antarctic ice sheet and covers an area of 14,000 km 5,400 sq mi 8 historic monuments edit vostok station tractor heavy tractor 11 which participated in the first traverse to the south geomagnetic pole along with a plaque to commemorate the opening of the station in 1957 has been designated a historic site or monument hsm 11 following a proposal by russia to the antarctic treaty consultative meeting 9 professor kudryashov s drilling complex building the drilling complex building stands close to vostok station at an elevation of 3488 m it was constructed in the summer season of 1983 1984 under the leadership of professor boris kudryashov ancient ice core samples were obtained the building has been designated a historic site or monument hsm 88 following a proposal by russia to the antarctic treaty consultative meeting 10 climate edit vostok station has an ice cap climate ef with subzero temperatures year round typical as with much of antarctica the station sees an average of only 22 millimetres 0.87 in of precipitation per year almost all occurring as snow with rainfall being very rare 11 so it is also one of the driest places on earth on average vostok station receives 26 days of snow per year 11 it is by far the coldest spot on earth with the lowest recorded temperature being 89.2 c 128.6 f the average summer temperature is 31.9 c 25.4 f meanwhile the average winter temperature is 68 c 90 f and the highest recorded temperature was 14.0 c 6.8 f in contrast it is also one of the sunniest places on earth with less than a 300-hour deficit against the sunniest despite having no sunshine at all between may and august there are more hours of sunshine per year than even the sunniest places in south africa 12 vostok has the highest sunshine total for any calendar month on earth at an average of 708.8 hours of sunshine in december or 22.9 hours daily it also has the lowest sunshine for any calendar month with an absolute maximum of 0 hours of sunshine per month during polar

with mean of 28 c 18 f 14 in addition to the extremely cold temperatures other factors make vostok one of the most difficult places on earth for human habitation an almost complete lack of moisture in the air an average windspeed of 5 metres per second 11 mph 18 km h sometimes rising to as high as 27 metres per second 60 mph 97 km h the lack of oxygen in the air because of its high elevation at

cycles connected to 18o 18o isotope of oxygen levels of methane ch 4 relative temperature levels of carbon dioxide co 2 in the 1970s the soviet union drilled a set of cores 500 952 m deep these have been used to study the oxygen isotope composition of the ice which showed that ice of the last glacial period was present below about 400 metres depth then three more holes were drilled in 1984 hole 3g reached a final depth of 2202 m in 1990 hole 4g reached a final depth of 2546 m and in 1993 hole 5g reached a depth of 2755 m after a brief closure drilling continued during the winter of 1995 in 1996 it was stopped at depth 3623 m by the request of the scientific committee on antarctic research that expressed worries about possible contamination of lake vostok this ice core drilled collaboratively with the french produced a record of past environmental conditions stretching back 420,000 years and covering four previous glacial periods for a long time it was the only core to cover several glacial cycles but in 2004 it was exceeded by the epica core which whilst shallower covers a longer time span in 2003 drilling was permitted to continue but was halted at the estimated distance to the lake of only 130 m the ancient lake was finally breached on 5 february 2012 when scientists stopped drilling at the depth of 3,770 metres and reached the surface of the sub-glacial lake the brittle zone is approximately between 250 and 750 m and corresponds to the last glacial maximum 21 with the end of the holocene climatic optimum at or near the 250-metre depth although the vostok core reached a depth of 3623 m the usable climatic information does not extend down this far the very bottom of the core is ice refrozen from the waters of lake vostok and contains no climate information the usual data sources give proxy information down to a depth of 3310 m or 414,000 years 22 below this there is evidence of ice deformation it has been suggested that the vostok record may be extended down to 3345 m or 436,000 years to include more of the interesting mis11 period by inverting a section of the record 23 this then produces a record in agreement with the newer longer epica record although it provides no new information see also edit list of antarctic research stations list of antarctic field camps lake vostok soviet antarctic expedition vostok traverse concordia station
