for the prehistoric martis people in the reno area 5 as early as the mid 1850s a few pioneers settled in the truckee meadows a relatively fertile valley through which the truckee river made its way from lake tahoe to pyramid lake in addition to subsistence farming these early residents could pick up business from travelers along the california trail which followed the truckee westward before branching off towards donner lake where the formidable obstacle of the sierra nevada began gold was discovered in the vicinity of virginia city in 1850 and a modest mining community developed but the discovery of silver in 1859 at the comstock lode led to a mining rush the overland limited at reno in 1913 to provide the necessary connection between virginia city and the california trail charles w fuller built a log toll bridge across the truckee river in 1859 a small community that would service travelers soon grew up near the bridge after two years fuller sold the bridge to myron c lake who continued to develop the community with the addition of a grist mill kiln and livery stable to the hotel and eating house he renamed it lake s crossing in 1864 washoe county was consolidated with roop

extension of the virginia and truckee railroad to reno in 1872 provided a boost to the new city s economy in the following decades reno continued to grow and prosper as a business and agricultural center and became the principal settlement on the transcontinental railroad between sacramento and salt lake city citation needed as the mining boom waned early in the 20th century nevada s centers of political and business activity shifted to the non-mining communities especially reno and las vegas and today the former mining metropolises stand as little more than ghost towns despite this nevada is still the third-largest gold producer in the world after south africa and australia the state yielded 6.9 percent of the world s supply in 2005 world gold production 8 the reno arch was erected on virginia street in 1926 to promote the upcoming transcontinental highways exposition of 1927 the arch included the words nevada s transcontinental highways exposition and the dates of the exposition

1930s the war years of the 1940s cemented reno as the place to play for two decades 13 beginning in the 1950s the need for economic diversification beyond gaming fueled a movement for more lenient business taxation 12 a disaster occurred on the afternoon of february 5 1957 when an explosion ripped through the heart of downtown at 1 03 pm two explosions caused by natural gas leaking into the maze of pipes and ditches under the city and an ensuing fire destroyed five buildings in the vicinity of sierra and first streets along the truckee river forty-nine people were injured in the disaster

edit wetlands are an important part of the reno tahoe area they act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it wetlands are home to over 75 of the species in the great basin however the area s wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city while developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals washoe county has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems mitigation in the future when developers try to build over a wetland they will be responsible for creating another wetland near washoe lake the truckee river serves as reno s primary source of drinking water it supplies reno with 80 million u s gallons 300 ml of water a day during the summer and 40 million u s gallons 150 ml of water per day in the winter before the water goes to the homes around the reno area it must go to one of two water treatment plants chalk bluff or glendale water treatment plant as an attempt to save water golf courses in reno have been using treated effluent water instead of treated water from one of reno s water plants the reno-sparks wastewater treatment plant discharges tertiary treated effluent to the truckee river in the 1990s this capacity was increased from 20 to 30 million u s gallons 70 to 110 million liters per day while treated the effluent contains suspended solids nitrogen and phosphorus aggravating water quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of pyramid lake local agencies working with the environmental protection agency have developed a number of watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded effluent discharge to accomplish this successful outcome the dssam model was developed and calibrated for the truckee river in order to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set 15 the resulting management strategies included a package of measures such as land use controls in the lake tahoe basin urban runoff controls in reno and sparks and best management practices for wastewater discharge reno nevada and the truckee meadows south west of the reno tahoe international airport has a large herd of mustang horses these horses nurse and range around the runoff of steamboat creek the mustang

sierra nevada on the western edge of the great basin at an elevation of about 4,400 feet 1,300 m above sea level numerous faults exist throughout the region most of these are normal vertical motion faults associated with the uplift of the various mountain ranges including the sierra nevada in february 2008 an earthquake swarm began to occur lasting for several months and with the largest quake registering at 4.9 on the richter magnitude scale although some geologic estimates put it at 5.0 the earthquakes were centered on the somersett community in western reno near the areas of mogul and verdi many homes in these areas were damaged 18 climate edit reno sits in the rain shadow of the sierra nevada mountain range annual rainfall averages 7.48 inches 190 mm despite this low amount of rainfall per year reno features a steppe climate k ppen bsk due to its low evapotranspiration annual precipitation has ranged from 1.55 inches 39.4 mm in 1947 to 13.23 inches 336.0 mm in 1983 the most precipitation in one month was 5.25 inches 133.4 mm in december 1955 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was 2.29 inches 58.2 mm on january 21 1943 winter has snowfall which is usually light to moderate but can be heavy some days averaging 21.5 inches 55 cm annually snowfall varies with the lowest amounts roughly 19 23 inches annually at the lowest part of the valley at and east of the reno tahoe international airport at 4,404 feet 1,342 m while the foothills of the carson range to the west ranging from 4,700 to 5,600 feet 1,400 to 1,700 m in elevation just a few miles west of downtown can receive up to two to three times as much annual snowfall the mountains of the virginia range to the east can receive more summer thunderstorms and precipitation and around twice as much annual snowfall above 5,500 feet 1,700 m however snowfall increases in the virginia range are less dramatic as elevation climbs than in the carson range to the west because the virginia range is well within the rain shadow of the sierra nevada and carson range the most snowfall in the city in one year was 63.8 inches 162 cm in 1971 and the most snowfall in one month was 29.0 inches 74 cm in march 1952 most rainfall occurs in winter and spring the city has 300 days of sunshine per year summer thunderstorms can occur between april and october the eastern side of town and the mountains east of reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind called a washoe zephyr can develop in the sierra nevada causing air to be pulled down in the sierra nevada and reno destroying or preventing thunderstorms but the same wind can push air upwards against the virginia range and other mountain ranges east of reno creating powerful thunderstorms 19 20 the monthly daily average temperature ranges from 35.3 f 1.8 c in december to 74.9 f 23.8 c in july with the diurnal temperature variation reaching 35 f 19 c in summer still lower
