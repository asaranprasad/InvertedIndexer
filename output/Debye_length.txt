these charges are distributed in a continuous medium that is characterized only by its relative static permittivity r displaystyle varepsilon r this distribution of charges within this medium gives

hannes alfv n pointed out that in a low density plasma localized space charge regions may build up large potential drops over distances of the order of some tens of the debye lengths such regions have been called electric double layers an electric double layer is the simplest space charge distribution that gives a potential drop in the layer and a vanishing electric field on each side of the layer in the laboratory double layers have been studied for half a century but their importance in cosmic plasmas has not been generally recognized 7 in a plasma edit in a non-isothermic plasma the
