infobox references nitrous oxide commonly known as laughing gas or nitrous 1 is a chemical compound an oxide of nitrogen with the formula n 2o at room temperature it is a colorless non-flammable gas with a slight metallic scent and taste at elevated temperatures nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidizer similar to molecular oxygen nitrous oxide has significant medical uses especially in surgery and dentistry for its anaesthetic and pain reducing effects its name laughing gas coined by humphry davy is due to the euphoric effects upon inhaling it a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anaesthetic it is on the world health organization s list of essential medicines the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system 2 it also is used as an oxidizer in rocket propellants and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines nitrous oxide occurs in small amounts in the atmosphere but recently has been found to be a major scavenger of stratospheric ozone with an impact comparable to that of cfcs it is estimated that 30 of the n 2o in the atmosphere is the result of human activity chiefly agriculture 3 contents 1 uses 1.1 rocket

rocket motor this is advantageous over other oxidisers in that it is not only non-toxic but due to its stability at room temperature is also easier to store and relatively safer to carry on a flight as a secondary benefit it may be decomposed readily to form breathing air its high density and low storage pressure when maintained at low temperature enable it to be highly competitive with stored high-pressure gas systems 4 in a 1914 patent american rocket pioneer robert goddard suggested nitrous oxide and gasoline as possible propellants for a liquid-fuelled rocket 5 nitrous oxide has been the oxidiser of choice in several hybrid rocket designs using solid fuel with a liquid or gaseous oxidizer the combination of nitrous oxide with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene fuel has been used by spaceshipone and others it also is notably used in amateur and high power rocketry with various plastics as the fuel nitrous oxide also may be used in a monopropellant rocket in the presence of a heated catalyst n 2o will decompose exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen at a temperature of approximately 1,070 f 577 c 6 because of the large heat release the catalytic action rapidly becomes secondary as thermal autodecomposition becomes dominant in a vacuum thruster this may provide a monopropellant specific impulse isp of as much as 180 s while noticeably less than the isp available from hydrazine thrusters monopropellant or bipropellant with dinitrogen tetroxide the decreased toxicity makes nitrous oxide an option worth investigating nitrous oxide is said to deflagrate at approximately 600 c 1,112 f at a pressure of 309 psi 21 atmospheres 7 at 600 psi for example the required ignition energy is only 6 joules whereas n 2o at 130 psi a 2500-joule ignition energy input is insufficient 8 9 internal combustion engine edit in vehicle racing nitrous oxide often referred to as just nitrous allows the engine to burn more fuel by providing more oxygen than air alone resulting in a more powerful combustion citation needed the gas is not flammable at a low pressure temperature but it delivers more oxygen than atmospheric air by breaking down at elevated temperatures therefore it often is mixed with another fuel that is easier to deflagrate nitrous oxide is a strong oxidant roughly equivalent to hydrogen peroxide and much stronger than oxygen gas nitrous oxide is stored as a compressed liquid the evaporation and expansion of liquid nitrous oxide in the intake manifold causes a large drop in intake charge temperature resulting in a denser charge further allowing more air fuel mixture to enter the cylinder sometimes nitrous oxide is injected into or prior to the intake manifold whereas other systems directly inject right before the cylinder direct port injection to increase power the technique was used during world war ii by luftwaffe aircraft with the gm-1 system to boost the power output of aircraft engines originally meant to provide the luftwaffe standard aircraft with superior high-altitude performance technological considerations limited its use to extremely high altitudes accordingly it was only used by specialized planes such as high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft high-speed bombers and high-altitude interceptor aircraft it sometimes could be found on luftwaffe aircraft also fitted with another engine-boost system mw 50 a form of water injection for aviation engines that used methanol for its boost capabilities one of the major problems of using nitrous oxide in a reciprocating engine is that it can produce enough power to damage or destroy the engine very large power increases are possible and if the mechanical structure of the engine is not properly reinforced the engine may be severely damaged or destroyed during this kind of operation it is very important with nitrous oxide augmentation of petrol engines to maintain proper operating temperatures and fuel levels to prevent pre-ignition 10 or detonation sometimes referred to as knock most problems that are associated with nitrous oxide do not come from mechanical failure due to the power increases since nitrous oxide allows a much denser charge into the cylinder it dramatically increases cylinder pressures the increased pressure and temperature can cause problems such as melting the piston or valves it also may crack or warp the piston or head and cause pre-ignition due to uneven heating automotive-grade liquid nitrous oxide differs slightly from medical-grade nitrous oxide a small amount of sulfur dioxide so 2 is added to prevent substance abuse 11 multiple washes through a base such as sodium hydroxide can remove this decreasing the corrosive properties observed when so 2 is further oxidised during combustion into sulfuric acid making emissions cleaner citation needed aerosol propellant edit food grade n 2o whippets the gas is approved for use as a food additive also known as e942 specifically as an aerosol spray propellant its most common uses in this context are in aerosol whipped cream canisters cooking sprays and as an inert gas used to displace oxygen in order to inhibit bacterial growth when filling packages of potato chips and other similar snack foods the gas is extremely soluble in fatty compounds in aerosol whipped cream it is dissolved in the fatty cream until it leaves the can when it becomes gaseous and thus creates foam used in this way it produces whipped cream four times the volume of the liquid whereas whipping air into cream only produces twice the volume if air were used as a propellant oxygen would accelerate rancidification of the butterfat but nitrous oxide inhibits such degradation carbon dioxide cannot be used for whipped cream because it is acidic in water which would curdle the cream and give it a seltzer-like sparkling sensation the whipped cream produced with nitrous oxide is unstable however and will return to a more liquid state within half an hour to one hour citation needed thus the method is not suitable for decorating food that will not be served immediately during december 2016 some manufacturers reported a shortage of aerosol whipped creams in the united states due to an explosion at the air liquide nitrous oxide facility in florida in late august with a major facility offline the disruption caused a shortage resulting in the company diverting the supply of nitrous oxide to medical clients rather than to food manufacturing the shortage came during the christmas and holiday season when canned whipped cream use is normally at its highest 12 similarly cooking spray which is made from various types of oils combined with lecithin an emulsifier may use nitrous oxide as a propellant other propellants used in cooking spray include food-grade alcohol and propane medicine edit medical grade n 2o tanks used in dentistry nitrous oxide has been used in dentistry and surgery as an anaesthetic and analgesic since 1844 13 in the early days the gas was administered through simple inhalers consisting of a breathing bag made of rubber cloth 14 today the gas is administered in hospitals by means of an automated relative analgesia machine with an anaesthetic vaporiser and a medical ventilator that delivers a precisely dosed and breath-actuated flow of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen in a 2 1 ratio nitrous oxide is a weak general anaesthetic and so is generally not used alone in general anaesthesia but used as a carrier gas mixed with oxygen for more powerful general anaesthetic drugs such as sevoflurane or desflurane it has a minimum alveolar concentration of 105 and a blood gas partition coefficient of 0.46 the use of nitrous oxide in anaesthesia however can increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting 15 16 17 dentists use a simpler machine that only delivers a n 2o o 2 mixture for the patient to inhale while conscious the patient is kept conscious throughout the procedure and retains adequate mental faculties to respond to questions and instructions from the dentist 18 inhalation of nitrous oxide is used frequently to relieve pain associated with childbirth trauma oral surgery and acute coronary syndrome includes heart attacks its use during labour has been shown to be a safe and effective aid for birthing women 19 its use for acute coronary syndrome is of unknown benefit 20 in britain and canada entonox and nitronox are used commonly by ambulance crews including unregistered practitioners as a rapid and highly effective analgesic gas 50 nitrous oxide can be considered for use by trained non-professional first aid responders in prehospital settings given the relative ease and safety of administering 50 nitrous oxide as an analgesic the rapid reversibility of its effect would also prevent it from precluding diagnosis 21 recreational use edit aquatint depiction of a laughing gas party in the nineteenth century recreational inhalation of nitrous oxide with the purpose of causing euphoria and or slight hallucinations began as a phenomenon for the british upper class in 1799 known as laughing gas parties whippit remnants of recreational drug use the netherlands 2017 starting already in the nineteenth century widespread availability of the gas for medical and culinary purposes allowed the recreational use to expand greatly throughout the world in the united kingdom as of 2014 nitrous oxide was estimated to be used by almost half a million young people at nightspots festivals and parties 22 the legality of that use varies greatly from country to country and even from city to city in some countries safety edit the major safety hazards of nitrous oxide come from the fact that it is a compressed liquefied gas an asphyxiation risk and a dissociative anaesthetic while relatively non-toxic nitrous oxide has a number of recognized ill effects on human health whether through breathing it in or by contact of the liquid with skin or eyes nitrous oxide is a significant occupational hazard for surgeons dentists and nurses because nitrous oxide is minimally metabolised in humans with a rate of 0.004 it retains its potency when exhaled into the room by the patient and can pose an intoxicating and prolonged exposure hazard to the clinic staff if the room is poorly ventilated where nitrous oxide is administered a continuous-flow fresh-air ventilation system or n 2o scavenger system is used to prevent a waste-gas buildup the national institute for occupational safety and health recommends that workers exposure to nitrous oxide should be controlled during the administration of anaesthetic gas in medical dental and veterinary operators 23 it set a recommended exposure limit rel of 25 ppm 46 mg m3 to escaped anaesthetic 24 mental and manual impairment edit exposure to nitrous oxide causes short-term decreases in mental performance audiovisual ability and manual dexterity 25 these effects coupled with the induced spatial and temporal disorientation could result in physical harm to the user from environmental hazards 26 neurotoxicity and neuroprotection edit like other nmda antagonists n 2o was suggested to produce neurotoxicity in the form of olney s lesions in rodents upon prolonged several hour exposure 27 28 29 30 new research has arisen suggesting that olney s lesions do not occur in humans however and similar drugs such as ketamine are now believed not to be acutely neurotoxic 31 32 it has been argued that because n 2o has a very short duration under normal circumstances it is less likely to be neurotoxic than other nmda antagonists 33 indeed in rodents short-term exposure results in only mild injury that is rapidly reversible and permanent neuronal death only occurs after constant and sustained exposure 27 nitrous oxide also may cause neurotoxicity after extended exposure because of hypoxia this is especially true of non-medical formulations such as whipped-cream chargers also known as whippets or nangs 34 which never contain oxygen since oxygen makes cream rancid 35 additionally nitrous oxide depletes vitamin b12 levels this can cause serious neurotoxicity with even acute use if the user has preexisting vitamin b12 deficiency 36 nitrous oxide at 75-vol reduce ischemia-induced neuronal death induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rodents and decrease nmda-induced ca2 influx in neuronal cell cultures a critical event involved in excitotoxicity 37 oxygen deprivation edit if pure nitrous oxide is inhaled without oxygen mixed in this can eventually lead to oxygen deprivation resulting in loss of blood pressure fainting and even heart attacks this can occur if the user inhales large quantities continuously as with a strap-on mask connected to a gas canister it can also happen if the user engages in excessive breath-holding or uses any other inhalation system that cuts off their supply of fresh air 38 vitamin b12 deficiency edit long-term exposure to nitrous oxide may cause vitamin b12 deficiency it inactivates the cobalamin form of vitamin b12 by oxidation symptoms of vitamin b12 deficiency including sensory neuropathy myelopathy and encephalopathy may occur within days or weeks of exposure to nitrous oxide anaesthesia in people with subclinical vitamin b12 deficiency symptoms are treated with high doses of vitamin b12 but recovery can be slow and incomplete 39 people with normal vitamin b12 levels have stores to make the effects of nitrous oxide insignificant unless exposure is repeated and prolonged nitrous oxide abuse vitamin b12 levels should be checked in people with risk factors for vitamin b12 deficiency prior to using nitrous oxide anaesthesia 40 prenatal development edit several experimental studies in rats indicate that chronic exposure of pregnant females to nitrous oxide may have adverse effects on the developing fetus 41 41 42 43 chemical physical risks edit at room temperature 20 c 68 f the saturated vapour pressure is 50.525 bar rising up to 72.45 bar at 36.4 c 97.5 f the critical temperature the pressure curve is thus unusually sensitive to temperature 44 liquid nitrous oxide acts as a good solvent for many organic compounds liquid mixtures may form shock sensitive explosives citation needed as with many strong oxidisers contamination of parts with fuels have been implicated in rocketry accidents where small quantities of nitrous fuel mixtures explode due to water hammer -like effects sometimes called dieseling heating due to adiabatic compression of gases can reach decomposition temperatures 45 some common building materials such as stainless steel and aluminium can act as fuels with strong oxidisers such as nitrous oxide as can contaminants that may ignite due to adiabatic compression 46 there also have been incidents where nitrous oxide decomposition in plumbing has led to the explosion of large tanks 7 mechanism of action edit the pharmacological mechanism of action of n 2o in medicine is not fully known however it has been shown to directly modulate a broad range of ligand-gated ion channels and this likely plays a major role in many of its effects it moderately blocks nmda and 2-subunit-containing nach channels weakly inhibits ampa kainate gabac and 5-ht3 receptors and slightly potentiates gabaa and glycine receptors 47 48 it also has been shown to activate two-pore-domain k channels 49 while n 2o affects quite a few ion channels its anaesthetic hallucinogenic and euphoriant effects are likely caused predominantly or fully via inhibition of nmda receptor-mediated currents 47 50 in addition to its effects on ion channels n 2o may act to imitate nitric oxide no in the central nervous system and this may be related to its analgesic and anxiolytic properties 50 the effects of inhaling sub-anaesthetic doses of nitrous oxide have been known to vary based on several factors including settings and individual differences 51 52 however from his discussion jay 2008 26 suggests that it has been reliably known to induce the following states and sensations intoxication euphoria dysphoria spatial disorientation temporal disorientation reduced pain sensitivity a minority of users also will present with uncontrolled vocalisations and muscular spasms these effects generally disappear minutes after removal of the nitrous oxide source 26 euphoric effect edit in rats n 2o stimulates the mesolimbic reward pathway via inducing dopamine release and activating dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens presumably through antagonisation of nmda receptors localised in the system 53 54 55 56 this action has been implicated in its euphoric effects and notably appears to augment its analgesic properties as well 53 54 55 56 it is remarkable however that in mice n 2o blocks amphetamine-induced carrier-mediated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and behavioural sensitisation abolishes the conditioned place preference cpp of cocaine and morphine and does not produce reinforcing or aversive effects of its own 57 58 studies on cpp of n 2o in rats is mixed consisting of reinforcement aversion and no change 59 in contrast it is a positive reinforcer in squirrel monkeys 60 and is well known as a drug of abuse in humans 61 these discrepancies in response to n 2o may reflect species variation or methodological differences 58 in human clinical studies n 2o was found to produce mixed responses similarly to rats reflecting high subjective individual variability 62 63 anxiolytic effect edit in behavioural tests of anxiety a low dose of n 2o is an effective anxiolytic and this anti-anxiety effect is associated with enhanced activity of gabaa receptors as it is partially reversed by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists mirroring this animals that have developed tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines are partially tolerant to n 2o 64 indeed in humans given 30 n 2o benzodiazepine receptor antagonists reduced the subjective reports of feeling high but did not alter psychomotor performance in human clinical studies 65 analgesic effect edit the analgesic effects of n 2o are linked to the interaction between the endogenous opioid system and the descending noradrenergic system when animals are given morphine chronically they develop tolerance to its pain-killing effects and this also renders the animals tolerant to the analgesic effects of n 2o 66 administration of antibodies that bind and block the activity of some endogenous opioids not -endorphin also block the antinociceptive effects of n 2o 67 drugs that inhibit the breakdown of endogenous opioids also potentiate the antinociceptive effects of n 2o 67 several experiments have shown that opioid receptor antagonists applied directly to the brain block the antinociceptive effects of n 2o but these drugs have no effect when injected into the spinal cord conversely 2-adrenoceptor antagonists block the pain-reducing effects of n 2o when given directly to the spinal cord but not when applied directly to the brain 68 indeed 2b-adrenoceptor knockout mice or animals depleted in norepinephrine are nearly completely resistant to the antinociceptive effects of n 2o 69 apparently n 2o-induced release of endogenous opioids causes disinhibition of brain stem noradrenergic neurons which release norepinephrine into the spinal cord and inhibit pain signalling 70 exactly how n 2o causes the release of endogenous opioid peptides remains uncertain properties and reactions edit nitrous oxide is a colourless non-toxic gas with a faint sweet odour nitrous oxide supports combustion by releasing the dipolar bonded oxygen radical name thus it can relight a glowing splint n 2o is inert at room temperature and has few reactions at elevated temperatures its reactivity increases for example nitrous oxide reacts with nanh 2 at 460 k 187 c to give nan 3 2 nanh 2 n 2o nan 3 naoh nh 3 the above reaction is the route adopted by the commercial chemical industry to produce azide salts which are used as detonators 71 history edit the gas was first synthesised in 1772 by english natural philosopher and chemist joseph priestley who called it phlogisticated nitrous air see phlogiston 72 or inflammable nitrous air 73 priestley published his discovery in the book experiments and observations on different kinds of air 1775 where he described how to produce the preparation of nitrous air diminished by heating iron filings dampened with nitric acid 74 early use edit living made easy a satirical print from 1830 depicting humphry davy administering a dose of laughing gas to a woman the first important use of nitrous oxide was made possible by thomas beddoes and james watt who worked together to publish the book considerations on the medical use and on the production of factitious airs 1794 this book was important for two reasons first james watt had invented a novel machine to produce factitious airs i e nitrous oxide and a novel breathing apparatus to inhale the gas second the book also presented the new medical theories by thomas beddoes that tuberculosis and other lung diseases could be treated by inhalation of factitious airs 13 the machine to produce factitious airs had three parts a furnace to burn the needed material a vessel with water where the produced gas passed through in a spiral pipe for impurities to be washed off and finally the gas cylinder with a gasometer where the gas produced air could be tapped into portable air bags made of airtight oily silk the breathing apparatus consisted of one of the portable air bags connected with a tube to a mouthpiece with this new equipment being engineered and produced by 1794 the way was paved for clinical trials clarification needed which began in 1798 when thomas beddoes established the pneumatic institution for relieving diseases by medical airs in hotwells bristol in the basement of the building a large-scale machine was producing the gases under the supervision of a young humphry davy who was encouraged to experiment with new gases for patients to inhale 13 the first important work of davy was examination of the nitrous oxide and the publication of his results in the book researches chemical and philosophical 1800 in that publication davy notes the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide at page 465 and its potential to be used for surgical operations at page 556 75 davy coined the name laughing gas for nitrous oxide 76 despite davy s discovery that inhalation of nitrous oxide could relieve a conscious person from pain another 44 years elapsed before doctors attempted to use it for anaesthesia the use of nitrous oxide as a recreational drug at laughing gas parties primarily arranged for the british upper class became an immediate success beginning in 1799 while the effects of the gas generally make the user appear stuporous dreamy and sedated some people also get the giggles in a state of euphoria and frequently erupt in laughter 77 one of the earliest commercial producers in the u s was george poe cousin of the poet edgar allan poe who also was the first to liquefy the gas 78 anaesthetic use edit the first time nitrous oxide was used as an anaesthetic drug in the treatment of a patient was when dentist horace wells with assistance by gardner quincy colton and john mankey riggs demonstrated insensitivity to pain from a dental extraction on 11 december 1844 79 in the following weeks wells treated the first 12 15 patients with nitrous oxide in hartford connecticut and according to his own record only failed in two cases 80 in spite of these convincing results having been reported by wells to the medical society in boston in december 1844 this new method was not immediately adopted by other dentists the reason for this was most likely that wells in january 1845 at his first public demonstration to the medical faculty in boston had been partly unsuccessful leaving his colleagues doubtful regarding its efficacy and safety 81 the method did not come into general use until 1863 when gardner quincy colton successfully started to use it in all his colton dental association clinics that he had just established in new haven and new york city 13 over the following three years colton and his associates successfully administered nitrous oxide to more than 25,000 patients 14 today nitrous oxide is used in dentistry as an anxiolytic as an adjunct to local anaesthetic nitrous oxide was not found to be a strong enough anaesthetic for use in major surgery in hospital settings however instead diethyl ether being a stronger and more potent anaesthetic was demonstrated and accepted for use in october 1846 along with chloroform in 1847 13 when joseph thomas clover invented the gas-ether inhaler in 1876 however it became a common practice at hospitals to initiate all anaesthetic treatments with a mild flow of nitrous oxide and then gradually increase the anaesthesia with the stronger ether or chloroform clover s gas-ether inhaler was designed to supply the patient with nitrous oxide and ether at the same time with the exact mixture being controlled by the operator of the device it remained in use by many hospitals until the 1930s 14 although hospitals today are using a more advanced anaesthetic machine these machines still use the same principle launched with clover s gas-ether inhaler to initiate the anaesthesia with nitrous oxide before the administration of a more powerful anaesthetic as a patent medicine edit colton s popularization of nitrous oxide led to its adoption by a number of less than reputable quacksalvers who touted it as a cure for consumption scrofula catarrh and other diseases of the blood throat and lungs nitrous oxide treatment was administered and licensed as a patent medicine by the likes of c l blood and jerome harris in boston and charles e barney of chicago 82 83 production edit industrial methods edit nitrous oxide production nitrous oxide is prepared on an industrial scale by careful heating of ammonium nitrate at about 250 c which decomposes into nitrous oxide and water vapour 84 nh 4no 3 2 h 2o n 2o the addition of various phosphate salts favours formation of a purer gas at slightly lower temperatures this reaction may be difficult to control resulting in detonation 85 laboratory methods edit the decomposition of ammonium nitrate is also a common laboratory method for preparing the gas equivalently it can be obtained by heating a mixture of sodium nitrate and ammonium sulfate 86 2 nano 3 nh 4 2 so 4 na 2so 4 2 n 2o 4 h 2o another method involves the reaction of urea nitric acid and sulfuric acid 87 2 nh 2 2co 2 hno 3 h 2so 4 2 n 2o 2

component of earth s atmosphere currently with a concentration of about 0.330 ppm 90 emissions by source edit as of 2010 it was estimated that about 29.5 million tonnes of n 2o containing 18.8 million tonnes of nitrogen were entering the atmosphere each year of which 64 were natural and 36 due to human activity 91 92 most of the n 2o emitted into the atmosphere from natural and anthropogenic sources is produced by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi in soils and oceans 93 soils under natural vegetation are an important source of nitrous oxide accounting for 60 of all naturally produced emissions other natural sources include the oceans 35 and atmospheric chemical reactions 5 91 the main components of anthropogenic emissions are fertilized agricultural soils and livestock manure 42 runoff and leaching of fertilizers 25 biomass burning 10 fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes 10 biological degradation of other nitrogen-containing atmospheric emissions 9 and human sewage 5 94 95 96 97 98 agriculture enhances nitrous oxide production through soil cultivation the use of nitrogen fertilisers and animal waste handling these activities stimulate naturally-occurring bacteria to produce more nitrous oxide nitrous oxide emissions from soil can be challenging to measure as they vary markedly over time and space and the majority of a year s emissions may occur when conditions are favorable during hot moments 99 and or at favorable locations known as hotspots 100 among industrial emissions the production of nitric acid and adipic acid are the largest sources of nitrous oxide emissions the adipic acid emissions specifically arise from the degradation of the nitrolic acid intermediate derived from nitration of cyclohexanone 94 101 102 biological processes edit natural processes that generate nitrous oxide may be classified as nitrification and denitrification specifically they include aerobic autotrophic nitrification the stepwise oxidation of ammonia nh 3 to nitrite no 2 and to nitrate no 3 e g kowalchuk and stephen 2001 anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification the stepwise reduction of no 3 to no 2 nitric oxide no n 2o and ultimately n 2 where facultative anaerobe bacteria use no 3 as an electron acceptor in the respiration of organic material in the condition of insufficient oxygen o 2 e g knowles 1982 and nitrifier

1998 m rkved et al 2007 these processes are affected by soil chemical and physical properties such as the availability of mineral nitrogen and organic matter acidity and soil type as well as climate-related factors such as soil temperature and water content e g mosier 1994 bouwman 1996 beauchamp 1997 yamulki et al 1997 dobbie and smith 2003 smith et al 2003 dalal et al 2003 the emission of the gas to the atmosphere is limited greatly by its consumption inside the cells by a process catalyzed by the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase 103 environmental impact edit greenhouse effect edit greenhouse gas trends nitrous oxide has a significant global warming potential as greenhouse gas on a per-molecule basis considered over a 100-year-period nitrous oxide has 298 times the atmospheric heat-trapping ability of carbon dioxide co 2 104 105 however because of its low concentration less than 1 1000 of that of co 2 90 its contribution to the greenhouse effect is less than one-third that of carbon dioxide and also less than water vapour and methane on the other hand since 38 or more of the n 2o entering the atmosphere is the result of human activity 94 and its concentration has increased 15 since 1750 90 106 control of nitrous oxide is considered part of efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions 107 a 2008 study by nobel laureate paul crutzen suggests that the amount of nitrous oxide release attributable to agricultural nitrate fertilizers has been seriously underestimated most of which presumably would come under soil and oceanic release in the environmental protection agency data 108 ozone layer depletion edit nitrous oxide also has been implicated in thinning of the ozone layer a new study suggests that n 2o emission currently is the single most important ozone-depleting substance ods emission and is expected to remain the largest throughout the twenty-first century 3 109 legality edit in the united states possession of nitrous oxide is legal under federal law and is not subject to dea purview 110 it is however regulated by the food and drug administration under the food drug and cosmetics act prosecution is possible under its misbranding clauses prohibiting the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide for the purpose of human consumption many states have laws regulating the possession sale and distribution of nitrous oxide such laws usually ban distribution to minors or limit the amount of nitrous oxide that may be sold without special license citation needed for example in the state of california possession for recreational use is prohibited and qualifies as a misdemeanour 111 in august 2015 the council of the london borough of lambeth uk banned the use of the drug for recreational purposes making offenders liable to an on-the-spot fine of up to 1,000 112 in new zealand the ministry of health has warned that nitrous oxide is a prescription medicine and its sale or possession without a prescription is an offense under the medicines act 113 this statement would seemingly prohibit all non-medicinal uses of nitrous oxide although it is implied that only recreational use will be targeted legally in india transfer of nitrous oxide from bulk cylinders to smaller more transportable e-type 1590 liter-capacity tanks 114 is legal when the intended use of the gas is for medical anaesthesia see also edit whipped-cream
