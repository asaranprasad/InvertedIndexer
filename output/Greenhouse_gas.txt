schematic showing energy flows between space the atmosphere and earth s surface energy influx and emittance are expressed in watts per square meter w m 2 a greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range this process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect 1 the primary greenhouse gases in earth s atmosphere are water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone without greenhouse gases the average temperature of earth s surface would be about 18 c 0 f 2 rather than the present average of 15 c 59 f 3 4 5 in the solar system the atmospheres of venus mars and titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect human activities since the beginning of the industrial revolution around 1750 have produced a 40 increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide co2 from 280 ppm in 1750 to 406 ppm in early 2017 6 this increase has occurred despite the uptake of more than half of the emissions by various natural sinks involved in the carbon cycle 7 8 the vast majority of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions i e emissions produced by human activities come from combustion of fossil fuels principally coal oil and natural gas with comparatively modest additional contributions coming from deforestation changes in land use soil erosion and agriculture 9 10 it has been estimated that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their present rate earth s surface temperature could exceed historical values as early as 2047 with potentially harmful effects on ecosystems biodiversity and the livelihoods of people worldwide 11 recent estimates also suggest that at current emission rates the earth could pass a threshold of 2 c global warming which the united nations ipcc designated as the upper limit to avoid dangerous global warming by 2036 12 contents 1 gases in earth s atmosphere 1.1 greenhouse gases 1.2 non-greenhouse gases 1.3 indirect radiative effects 1.4 contribution of clouds

bibliography 13 external links 13.1 carbon dioxide emissions gases in earth s atmosphere edit atmospheric absorption and scattering at different wavelengths of electromagnetic waves the largest absorption band of carbon dioxide is not far from the maximum in the thermal emission from ground and it partly closes the window of transparency of water hence its major effect greenhouse gases edit greenhouse gases are those that absorb and emit infrared radiation in the wavelength range emitted by earth 1 in order the most abundant greenhouse gases in earth s atmosphere are water vapor h 2o carbon dioxide co 2 methane ch 4 nitrous oxide n 2o ozone o 3 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs hydrofluorocarbons incl hcfcs and hfcs atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are determined by the balance between sources emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems and sinks the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different chemical compound 13 the proportion of an emission remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time is the airborne fraction af the annual airborne fraction is the ratio of the atmospheric increase in a given year to that year s total emissions as of 2006 the annual airborne fraction for co2 was about 0.45 the annual airborne fraction increased at a rate of 0.25 0.21 per year over the period 1959 2006 14 non-greenhouse gases edit the major atmospheric constituents nitrogen n 2 oxygen o 2 and argon ar are not greenhouse gases because molecules containing two atoms of the same element such as n 2 and o 2 and monatomic molecules such as argon ar have no net change in the distribution of their electrical charges when they vibrate hence they are almost totally unaffected by infrared radiation although molecules containing two atoms of different elements such as carbon monoxide co or hydrogen chloride hcl absorb infrared radiation these molecules are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their reactivity and solubility therefore they do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect and often are omitted when discussing greenhouse gases indirect radiative effects edit the false colors in this image represent concentrations of carbon monoxide in the lower atmosphere ranging from about 390 parts per billion dark brown pixels to 220 parts per billion red pixels to 50 parts per billion blue pixels 15 some gases have indirect radiative effects whether or not they are greenhouse gases themselves this happens in two main ways one way is that when they break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas for example methane and carbon monoxide co are oxidized to give carbon dioxide and methane oxidation also produces water vapor as discussed later oxidation of co to co2 directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the reason is subtle the peak of the thermal ir emission from earth s surface is very close to a strong vibrational absorption band of co2 15 microns or 667 cm 1 on the other hand the single co vibrational band only absorbs ir at much shorter wavelengths 4.7 microns or 2145 cm 1 where the emission of radiant energy from earth s surface is at least a factor of ten lower oxidation of methane to co2 which requires reactions with the oh radical produces an instantaneous reduction in radiative absorption and emission since co2 is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane although co2 has a longer lifetime as described below this is not the whole story since the oxidations of co and ch 4 are intertwined by both consuming oh radicals in any case the calculation of the total radiative effect needs to include both the direct and indirect forcing a second type of indirect effect happens when chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving these gases change the concentrations of greenhouse gases for example the destruction of non-methane volatile organic compounds nmvocs in the atmosphere can produce ozone the size of the indirect effect can depend strongly on where and when the gas is emitted 16 methane has a number of indirect effects in addition to forming co2 first the main chemical that reacts with methane in the atmosphere is the hydroxyl radical oh thus more methane means that the concentration of oh goes down effectively methane increases its own atmospheric lifetime and therefore its overall radiative effect the second effect is that the oxidation of methane can produce ozone third as well as making co2 the oxidation of methane produces water this is a major source of water vapor in the stratosphere which is otherwise very dry co and nmvocs also produce co2 when they are oxidized they remove oh from the atmosphere and this leads to higher concentrations of methane the surprising effect of this is that the global warming potential of co is three times that of co2 17 the same process that converts nmvocs to carbon dioxide can also lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone halocarbons have an indirect effect because they destroy stratospheric ozone finally hydrogen can lead to ozone production and ch 4 increases as well as producing water vapor in the stratosphere 16 contribution of clouds to earth s greenhouse effect edit the major non-gas contributor to earth s greenhouse effect clouds also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on radiative properties of the greenhouse gases clouds are water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere 18 19 impacts on the overall greenhouse effect edit schmidt et al 2010 20 analysed how individual components of the atmosphere contribute to the total greenhouse effect they estimated that water vapor accounts for about 50 of earth s greenhouse effect with clouds contributing 25 carbon dioxide 20 and the minor greenhouse gases and aerosols accounting for the remaining 5 in the study the reference model atmosphere is for 1980 conditions image credit nasa 21 the contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is determined by the characteristics of that gas its abundance and any indirect effects it may cause for example the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame 22 but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime on the other hand in addition to its direct radiative impact methane has a large indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation shindell et al 2005 23 argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect 24 when ranked by their direct contribution to the greenhouse effect the most important are 18 not in citation given compound formula concentration in atmosphere 25 ppm contribution water vapor and clouds h 2o 10 50,000 a 36 72 carbon dioxide co2 400 9 26 methane ch 4 1.8 4 9 ozone o 3 2 8 b 3 7 notes a water vapor strongly varies locally 26 b the concentration in stratosphere about 90 of the ozone in earth s atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere in addition to the main greenhouse gases listed above other greenhouse gases include sulfur hexafluoride hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons see ipcc list of greenhouse gases some greenhouse gases are not often listed for example nitrogen trifluoride has a high global warming potential gwp but is only present in very small quantities 27 proportion of direct effects at a given moment edit it is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect this is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others so that the total greenhouse effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas the higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases 18 19 in addition some gases such as methane are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified 28 atmospheric lifetime edit aside from water vapor which has a residence time of about nine days 29 major greenhouse gases are well mixed and take many years to leave the atmosphere 30 although it is not easy to know with precision how long it takes greenhouse gases to leave the atmosphere there are estimates for the principal greenhouse gases jacob 1999 31 defines the lifetime displaystyle tau of an atmospheric species x in a one-box model as the average time that a molecule of x remains in the box mathematically displaystyle tau can be defined as the ratio of the mass m displaystyle m in kg of x in the box to its removal rate which is the sum of the flow of x out of the box f o u t displaystyle f out chemical loss of x l displaystyle l and deposition of x d displaystyle d all in kg s m f o u t l d displaystyle tau frac m f out l d 31 if one stopped pouring any of this gas into the box then after a time displaystyle tau its concentration would be about halved the atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil the oceans and other waters or vegetation and other biological systems reducing the excess to background concentrations the average time taken to achieve this is the mean lifetime carbon dioxide has a variable atmospheric lifetime and cannot be specified precisely 32 the atmospheric lifetime of co2 is estimated of the order of 30 95 years 33 this figure accounts for co2 molecules being removed from the atmosphere by mixing into the ocean photosynthesis and other processes however this excludes the balancing fluxes of co2 into the atmosphere from the geological reservoirs which have slower characteristic rates 34 although more than half of the co2 emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century some fraction about 20 of emitted co2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years 35 36 37 similar issues apply to other greenhouse gases many of which have longer mean lifetimes than co2 e g n2o has a mean atmospheric lifetime of 121 years 22 radiative forcing edit earth absorbs some of the radiant energy received from the sun reflects some of it as light and reflects or radiates the rest back to space as heat 38 earth s surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy 38 if this energy balance is shifted earth s surface becomes warmer or cooler leading to a variety of changes in global climate 38 a number of natural and man-made mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in earth s climate 38 greenhouse gases are one such mechanism 38 greenhouse gases absorb and emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from earth s surface causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere 38 as explained above some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries and therefore can affect earth s energy balance over a long period 38 radiative forcing quantifies the effect of factors that influence earth s energy balance including changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases 38 positive radiative forcing leads to warming by increasing the net incoming energy whereas negative radiative forcing leads to cooling 38 global warming potential edit the global warming potential gwp depends on both the efficiency of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime gwp is measured relative to the same mass of co2 and evaluated for a specific timescale thus if a gas has a high positive radiative forcing but also a short lifetime it will have a large gwp on a 20-year scale but a small one on a 100-year scale conversely if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than co2 its gwp will increase with the timescale considered carbon dioxide is defined to have a gwp of 1 over all time periods methane has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 3 years the 2007 ipcc report lists the gwp as 72 over a time scale of 20 years 25 over 100 years and 7.6 over 500 years 39 a 2014 analysis however states that although methane s initial impact is about 100 times greater than that of co2 because of the shorter atmospheric lifetime after six or seven decades the impact of the two gases is about equal and from then on methane s relative role continues to decline 40 the decrease in gwp at longer times is because methane is degraded to water and co2 through chemical reactions in the atmosphere examples of the atmospheric lifetime and gwp relative to co2 for several greenhouse gases are given in the following table atmospheric lifetime and gwp relative to co 2 at different time horizon for various greenhouse gases gas name chemical formula lifetime years 22 global warming potential gwp for

atmosphere compared to carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel this diagram shows a simplified representation of the contemporary global carbon cycle changes are measured in gigatons of carbon per

human-produced synthetic halocarbons most greenhouse gases have both natural and human-caused sources during the pre-industrial holocene concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant because the large natural sources and sinks roughly balance in the industrial era human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere mainly through the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests 47 48 the 2007 fourth assessment report compiled by the ipcc ar4 noted that changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system and concluded that increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations is very likely to have caused most of the increases in global average temperatures

concentration variations over the past 800,000 years see the following section both co2 and ch 4 vary between glacial and interglacial phases and concentrations of these gases correlate strongly with temperature direct data does not exist for periods earlier than those represented in the ice core record a record that indicates co2 mole fractions stayed within a range of 180 ppm to 280 ppm throughout the last 800,000 years until the increase of the last 250 years however various proxies and modeling suggests larger variations in past epochs 500 million years ago co2 levels were likely 10 times higher than now 61 indeed higher co2 concentrations are thought to have prevailed throughout most of the phanerozoic eon with concentrations four to six times current concentrations during the mesozoic era and ten to fifteen times current concentrations during the early palaeozoic era until the middle of the devonian period about 400 ma 62 63 64 the spread of land plants is thought to have reduced co2 concentrations during the late devonian and plant activities as both sources and sinks of co2 have since been important in providing stabilising feedbacks 65 earlier still a 200-million year period of intermittent widespread glaciation extending close to the equator snowball earth appears to have been ended suddenly about 550 ma by a colossal volcanic outgassing that raised the co2 concentration of the atmosphere abruptly to 12 about 350 times modern levels causing extreme greenhouse conditions and carbonate deposition as limestone at the rate of about 1 mm per day 66 this episode marked the close of the precambrian eon and was succeeded by the generally warmer conditions of the phanerozoic during which multicellular animal and plant life evolved no volcanic carbon dioxide emission of comparable scale has occurred since in the modern era emissions to the atmosphere from volcanoes are only about 1 of emissions from human sources 66 67 68 ice cores edit measurements from antarctic ice cores show that before industrial emissions started atmospheric co2 mole fractions were about 280 parts per million ppm and stayed between 260 and 280 during the preceding ten thousand years 69 carbon dioxide mole fractions in the atmosphere have gone up by approximately 35 percent since the 1900s rising from 280 parts per million by volume to 387 parts per million in 2009 one study using evidence from stomata of fossilized leaves suggests greater variability with carbon dioxide mole fractions above 300 ppm during the period seven to ten thousand years ago 70 though others have argued that these findings more likely reflect calibration or contamination problems rather than actual co2 variability 71 72 because of the way air is trapped in ice pores in the ice close off slowly to form bubbles deep within the firn and the time period represented in each ice sample analyzed these figures represent averages of atmospheric concentrations of up to a few centuries rather than annual or decadal levels changes since the industrial revolution edit recent year-to-year increase of atmospheric co 2 major greenhouse gas trends since the beginning of the industrial revolution the concentrations of most of the greenhouse gases have increased for example the mole fraction of carbon dioxide has increased from 280 ppm to 400 ppm or 120 ppm over modern pre-industrial levels the first 30 ppm increase took place in about 200 years from the start of the industrial revolution to 1958 however the next 90 ppm increase took place within 56 years from 1958 to 2014 73 74 recent data also shows that the concentration is increasing at a higher rate in the 1960s the average annual increase was only 37 of what it was in 2000 through 2007 75 today the stock of carbon in the atmosphere increases by more than 3 million tonnes per annum 0.04 compared with the existing stock clarification needed this increase is the result of human activities by burning fossil fuels deforestation and forest degradation in tropical and boreal regions 76 the other greenhouse gases produced from human activity show similar increases in both amount and rate of increase many observations are available online in a variety of atmospheric chemistry observational databases anthropogenic greenhouse gases edit this graph shows changes in the annual greenhouse gas index aggi between 1979 and 2011 77 the aggi measures the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere based on their ability to cause changes in earth s climate 77 this bar graph shows global greenhouse gas emissions by sector from 1990 to 2005 measured in carbon dioxide equivalents 78 modern global co2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels since about 1750 human activity has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases measured atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are currently 100 ppm higher than pre-industrial levels 79 natural sources of carbon dioxide are more than 20 times greater than sources due to human activity 80 but over periods longer than a few years natural sources are closely balanced by natural sinks mainly photosynthesis of carbon compounds by plants and marine plankton as a result of this balance the atmospheric mole fraction of carbon dioxide remained between 260 and 280 parts per million for the 10,000 years between the end of the last glacial maximum and the start of the industrial era 81 it is likely that anthropogenic i e human-induced warming such as that due to elevated greenhouse gas levels has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems 82 future warming is projected to have a range of impacts including sea level rise 83 increased frequencies and severities of some extreme weather events 83 loss of biodiversity 84 and regional changes in agricultural productivity 84 the main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity are burning of fossil fuels and deforestation leading to higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the air land use change mainly deforestation in the tropics account for up to one third of total anthropogenic co2 emissions 81 livestock enteric fermentation and manure management 85 paddy rice farming land use and wetland changes man-made lakes 86 pipeline losses and covered vented landfill emissions leading to higher methane atmospheric concentrations many of the newer style fully vented septic systems that enhance and target the fermentation process also are sources of atmospheric methane use of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs in refrigeration systems and use of cfcs and halons in fire suppression systems and manufacturing processes agricultural activities including the use of fertilizers that lead to higher nitrous oxide n 2o

major anthropogenic greenhouse gases 89 147 90 and are regulated under the kyoto protocol international treaty which came into force in 2005 91 emissions limitations specified in the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 91 the canc n agreement agreed in 2010 includes voluntary pledges made by 76 countries to control emissions 92 at the time of the agreement these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85 of annual global emissions 92 although cfcs are greenhouse gases they are regulated by the montreal protocol which was motivated by cfcs contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming note that ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming though the two processes often are confused in the media on 15 october 2016 negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at the summit of the united nations environment programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons hfcs in an amendment to the montreal protocol 93 94 95 sectors edit this section needs expansion with information on emissions from other sectors you can help by july 2013 this figure shows the relative fraction of anthropogenic greenhouse gases coming from each of eight categories of sources as estimated by the emission database for global atmospheric research version 3.2 fast track 2000 project 1 these values are intended to provide a snapshot of global annual greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2000 the top panel shows the sum over all anthropogenic greenhouse gases weighted by their global warming potential over the next 100 years this consists of 72 carbon dioxide 18 methane 8 nitrous oxide and 1 other gases lower panels show the comparable information for each of these three primary greenhouse gases with the same coloring of sectors as used in the top chart segments with less than 1 fraction are not labeled tourism edit according to unep global tourism is closely linked to climate change tourism is a significant contributor to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere tourism accounts for about 50 of traffic movements rapidly expanding air traffic contributes about 2.5 of the production of co2 the number of international travelers is expected to increase from 594 million in 1996 to 1.6 billion by 2020 adding greatly to the problem unless steps are taken to reduce emissions 96 road haulage edit the road haulage industry plays a part in production of co2 contributing around 20 of the uk s total carbon emissions a year with only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39 97 average carbon emissions within the haulage industry are falling in the thirty-year period from 1977 to 2007 the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile journey fell by 21 percent nox emissions are also down 87 percent whereas journey times have fallen by around a third 98 due to their size hgvs often receive criticism regarding their co2 emissions however rapid development in engine technology and fuel management is having a largely positive effect role of water vapor edit increasing water vapor in the stratosphere at boulder colorado water vapor accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse effect between 36 and 66 for clear sky conditions and between 66 and 85 when including clouds 19 water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally but human activity does not directly affect water vapor concentrations except at local scales such as near irrigated fields indirectly human activity that increases global temperatures will increase water vapor concentrations a process known as water vapor feedback 99 the atmospheric concentration of vapor is highly variable and depends largely on temperature from less than 0.01 in extremely cold regions up to 3 by mass in saturated air at about 32 c 100 see relative humidity other important facts the average residence time of a water molecule in the atmosphere is only about nine days compared to years or centuries for other greenhouse gases such as ch 4 and co2 101 thus water vapor responds to and amplifies effects of the other greenhouse gases the clausius clapeyron relation establishes that more water vapor will be present per unit volume at elevated temperatures this and other basic principles indicate that warming associated with increased concentrations of the other greenhouse gases also will increase the concentration of water vapor assuming that the relative humidity remains approximately constant modeling and observational studies find that this is indeed so because water vapor is a greenhouse gas this results in further warming and so is a positive feedback that amplifies the original warming eventually other earth processes offset these positive feedbacks stabilizing the global temperature at a new equilibrium and preventing the loss of earth s water through a venus-like runaway greenhouse effect 102 direct greenhouse gas emissions edit between the period 1970 to 2004 greenhouse gas emissions measured in co2-equivalent 103 increased at an average rate of 1.6 per year with co2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels growing at a rate of 1.9 per year 104 105 total anthropogenic emissions at the end of 2009 were estimated at 49.5 gigatonnes co2-equivalent 106 15 these emissions include co2 from fossil fuel use and from land use as well as emissions of methane nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases covered by the kyoto protocol at present the primary source of co2 emissions is the burning of coal natural gas and petroleum for electricity and heat 107 regional and national attribution of emissions edit according to the environmental protection agency epa ghg emissions in the united states can be traced from different sectors 108 there are several different ways of measuring greenhouse gas emissions for example see world bank 2010 109 362 for tables of national emissions data some variables that have been reported 110 include definition of measurement boundaries emissions can be attributed geographically to the area where they were emitted the territory principle or by the activity principle to the territory produced the emissions these two principles result in different totals when measuring for example electricity importation from one country to another or emissions at an international airport time horizon of different gases contribution of a given greenhouse gas is reported as a co2 equivalent the calculation to determine this takes into account how long that gas remains in the atmosphere this is not always known accurately and calculations must be regularly updated to reflect new information what sectors are included in the calculation e g energy industries industrial processes agriculture etc there is often a conflict between transparency and availability of data the measurement protocol itself this may be via direct measurement or estimation the four main methods are the emission factor-based method mass balance method predictive emissions monitoring systems and continuous emissions monitoring systems these methods differ in accuracy cost and usability these different measures are sometimes used by different countries to assert various policy ethical positions on climate change banuri et al 1996 p 94 111 this use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets there are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool or at least the development of communication between different tools 110 emissions may be measured over long time periods this measurement type is called historical or cumulative emissions cumulative emissions give some indication of who is responsible for the build-up in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases iea 2007 p 199 112 the national accounts balance would be positively related to carbon emissions the national accounts balance shows the difference between exports and imports for many richer nations such as the united states the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported this is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods we believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels holtz-eakin 1995 pp 85 101 113 emissions may also be measured across shorter time periods emissions changes may for example be measured against a base year of 1990 1990 was used in the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc as the base year for emissions and is also used in the kyoto protocol some gases are also measured from the year 1995 89 146,149 a country s emissions may also be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year another measurement is of per capita emissions this divides a country s total annual emissions by its mid-year population 109 370 per capita emissions may be based on historical or annual emissions

use can affect the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by altering how much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into carbon sinks 114 accounting for land-use change can be understood as an attempt to measure net emissions i e gross emissions from all sources minus the removal of emissions from the atmosphere by carbon sinks banuri et al 1996 pp 92 93 111 there are substantial uncertainties in the measurement of net carbon emissions 115 additionally there is controversy over how carbon sinks should be allocated between different regions and over time banuri et al 1996 p 93

sharp acceleration in co2 emissions since 2000 to more than a 3 increase per year more than 2 ppm per year from 1.1 per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed nations china was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during this period localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the soviet union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region due to more efficient energy use made necessary by the increasing proportion of it that is exported 87 in comparison methane has not increased appreciably and n 2o by 0.25 y 1 using different base years for measuring emissions has an effect on estimates of national contributions to global warming 118 17 18 121 this

attributing greenhouse gas ghg emissions is to measure the embedded emissions also referred to as embodied emissions of goods that are being consumed emissions are usually measured according to production rather than consumption 126 for example in the main international treaty on climate change the unfccc countries report on emissions produced within their borders e g the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels 119 179 127 1 under a production-based accounting of emissions embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting rather than the importing country under a consumption-based accounting of emissions embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the importing country rather than the exporting country davis and caldeira 2010 127 4 found that a substantial proportion of co2 emissions are traded internationally the net effect of trade was to export emissions from china and other emerging markets to consumers in the us japan and western europe based on annual emissions data from the year 2004 and on a per-capita consumption basis the top-5 emitting countries were found to be in tco2 per person per year luxembourg 34.7 the us 22.0 singapore 20.2 australia 16.7 and canada 16.6 127 5 carbon trust research revealed that approximately 25 of all co2 emissions from human activities flow i e are imported or exported from one country to another major developed economies were found to be typically net importers of embodied carbon emissions with uk consumption emissions 34 higher than production emissions and germany 29 japan 19 and the usa 13 also significant net importers of embodied emissions 128 effect of policy edit governments have taken action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions climate change mitigation assessments of policy effectiveness have included work by the intergovernmental panel on climate change 129 international energy agency 130 131 and united nations environment programme 132 policies implemented by governments have included 133 134 135 national and regional targets to reduce emissions promoting energy efficiency and support for renewable energy such as solar energy as an effective use of renewable energy because solar uses energy from the sun and does not release pollutants into the air countries and regions listed in annex i of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc i e the oecd and former planned economies of the soviet union are required to submit periodic assessments to the unfccc of actions they are taking to address climate change 135 3 analysis by the unfccc 2011 135 8 suggested that policies and measures undertaken by annex i parties may have produced emission savings of 1.5 thousand tg co2-eq in the year 2010 with most savings made in the energy sector the projected emissions saving of 1.5 thousand tg co2-eq is measured against a hypothetical baseline of annex i emissions i e projected annex i emissions in the absence of policies and measures the total projected annex i saving of 1.5 thousand co2-eq does not include emissions savings in seven of the annex i parties 135 8 projections edit a wide range of projections of future emissions have been produced 136 rogner et al 2007 137 assessed the scientific literature on greenhouse gas projections rogner et al 2007 104 concluded that unless energy policies changed substantially the world would continue to depend on fossil fuels until 2025 2030 projections suggest that more than 80 of the world s energy will come from fossil fuels this conclusion was based on much evidence and high agreement in the literature 104 projected annual energy-related co2 emissions in 2030 were 40 110 higher than in 2000 with two-thirds of the increase originating in developing countries 104 projected annual per capita emissions in developed country regions remained substantially lower 2.8 5.1 tonnes co2 than those in developed country regions 9.6 15.1 tonnes co2 138

generator types without scrubbing 1001 removal from the atmosphere sinks edit natural processes edit greenhouse gases can be removed from the atmosphere by various processes as a consequence of a physical change condensation and precipitation remove water vapor from the atmosphere a chemical reaction within the atmosphere for example methane is oxidized by reaction with naturally occurring hydroxyl radical oh and degraded to co2 and water vapor co2 from the oxidation of methane is not included in the methane global warming potential other chemical reactions include solution and solid phase chemistry occurring in atmospheric aerosols a physical exchange between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet an example is the mixing of atmospheric gases into the oceans a chemical change at the interface between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet this is the case for co2 which is reduced by photosynthesis of plants and which after dissolving in the oceans reacts to form carbonic acid and bicarbonate and carbonate ions see ocean acidification a photochemical change halocarbons are dissociated by uv light releasing cl and f as free radicals in the stratosphere with harmful effects on ozone halocarbons are generally too stable to disappear by chemical reaction in the atmosphere negative emissions edit a number of technologies remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere most widely analysed are those that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere either to geologic formations such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage 145 146 147 and carbon dioxide air capture 147 or to the soil as in the case with biochar 147 the ipcc has pointed out that many long-term climate scenario models require large-scale manmade negative emissions to avoid serious climate change 148 history of scientific research edit in the late 19th century scientists experimentally discovered that n 2 and o 2 do not absorb infrared radiation called at that time dark radiation while water both as true vapor and condensed in the form of microscopic droplets suspended in clouds and co2 and other poly-atomic gaseous molecules do absorb infrared radiation in the early 20th century researchers realized that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere made earth s overall temperature higher than it would be without them during the late 20th century a scientific consensus evolved that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cause a substantial rise in global temperatures and changes to other parts of the climate system 149
