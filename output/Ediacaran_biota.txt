cladistics convergent evolution stem and crown groups v t the ediacaran i di k r n formerly vendian biota consisted of enigmatic tubular and frond-shaped mostly sessile organisms that lived during the ediacaran period ca 635 542 mya trace fossils of these organisms have been found worldwide and represent the earliest known complex multicellular organisms note 1 the ediacaran biota may have radiated in a proposed event called the avalon explosion million years ago 1 2 after the earth had thawed from the cryogenian period s extensive glaciation the biota largely disappeared with the rapid increase in biodiversity known as the cambrian explosion most of the currently existing body plans of animals first appeared in the fossil record of the cambrian rather than the ediacaran for macroorganisms the cambrian biota appears to have completely replaced the organisms that dominated the ediacaran fossil record although relationships are still a matter of debate the organisms of the ediacaran period first appeared around million years ago and flourished until the cusp of the cambrian million years ago when the characteristic communities of fossils vanished the earliest reasonably diverse ediacaran community was discovered in 1995 in sonora mexico and is approximately 600 million years in age pre-dating the gaskiers glaciation of about 580 million years ago 3 4 while rare fossils that may represent survivors have been found as late as the middle cambrian 510 to 500 million years ago the earlier fossil communities disappear from the record at the end of the ediacaran leaving only curious fragments of once-thriving ecosystems 5 multiple hypotheses exist to explain the disappearance of this biota including preservation bias a changing environment the advent of predators and competition from other life-forms determining where ediacaran organisms fit in the tree of life has proven challenging it is not even established that they were animals with suggestions that they were lichens fungus-alga symbionts algae protists known as foraminifera fungi or microbial colonies or hypothetical intermediates between plants and animals 6 the morphology and habit of some taxa e g funisia dorothea suggest relationships to porifera or cnidaria 7 kimberella may show a similarity to molluscs and other organisms have been thought to possess bilateral symmetry although this is controversial most macroscopic fossils are morphologically distinct from later life-forms they resemble discs tubes mud-filled bags or quilted mattresses due to the difficulty of deducing evolutionary relationships among these organisms some palaeontologists have suggested that these represent completely extinct lineages that do not resemble any living organism one palaeontologist proposed a separate kingdom level category vendozoa now renamed vendobionta 8 in the linnaean hierarchy for the ediacaran biota if these enigmatic organisms left no descendants their strange forms might be seen as a failed experiment in multicellular life with later multicellular life evolving independently from unrelated single-celled organisms 9 the ediacara biota in context view discuss -650 -640 -630

terranovica in 1868 their discoverer scottish geologist alexander murray found them useful aids for correlating the age of rocks around newfoundland 13 however since they lay below the primordial strata of the cambrian that was then thought to contain the very first signs of animal life a proposal four years after their discovery by elkanah billings that these simple forms represented fauna was dismissed by his peers instead they were interpreted as gas escape structures or inorganic concretions 13 no similar structures elsewhere in the world were then known and the one-sided debate soon fell into obscurity 13 in 1933 georg g rich discovered specimens in namibia 14 but the firm belief that complex life originated in the cambrian led to them being assigned to the cambrian period and no link to aspidella was made in 1946 reg sprigg noticed jellyfishes in the ediacara hills of australia s flinders ranges 15 but these rocks were believed to be early cambrian so while the discovery sparked some interest little serious attention was garnered palaeontologist guy narbonne examining ediacaran fossils in newfoundland it was not until the british discovery of the iconic charnia in 1957 that the pre-cambrian was seriously considered as containing life this frond-shaped fossil was found in england s charnwood forest 16 and due to the detailed geological mapping of the british geological survey there was no doubt these fossils sat in precambrian rocks palaeontologist martin glaessner finally in 1959 made the connection between this and the earlier finds 17 18 and with a combination of improved dating of existing specimens and an injection of vigour into the search many more instances were recognised 19 all specimens discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained sandstone that prevented preservation of fine details making interpretation difficult s b misra s discovery of fossiliferous ash-beds at the mistaken point assemblage in newfoundland changed all this as the delicate detail preserved by the fine ash allowed the description of features that were previously undiscernible 20 21 poor communication combined with the difficulty in correlating globally distinct formations led to a plethora of different names for the biota in 1960 the french name ediacarien after the ediacaran hills in south australia which take their name from aborigine idiyakra water is present was added to the competing terms sinian and vendian 22 for terminal-precambrian rocks and these names were also applied to the life-forms ediacaran and ediacarian were subsequently applied to the epoch or period of geological time and its corresponding rocks in march 2004 the international union of geological sciences ended the inconsistency by formally naming the terminal period of the neoproterozoic after the australian locality 23 the term ediacaran biota and similar ediacara ediacaran ediacarian vendian fauna biota has at various times been used in a geographic stratigraphic taphonomic or biological sense with the latter the most common in modern literature 24 preservation edit modern cyanobacterial-algal mat salty lake on the white sea seaside microbial mats edit the fossil charniodiscus is barely distinguishable from the elephant skin texture on this cast microbial mats are areas of sediment stabilised by the presence of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles they appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony s growth individuals do not themselves move if too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled elephant skin and tubercular texture 25 some ediacaran strata with the texture characteristics of microbial mats contain fossils and ediacaran fossils are almost always found in beds that contain these microbial mats although microbial mats were once widespread the evolution of grazing organisms in the cambrian vastly reduced their numbers 26 these communities are now limited to inhospitable refugia such as the stromatolites found in hamelin pool marine nature reserve in shark bay western australia where the salt levels can be twice those of the surrounding sea 27 fossilization edit the preservation of these fossils is one of their great fascinations to science as soft-bodied organisms they would normally not fossilize and unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the burgess shale or solnhofen limestone the ediacaran biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions they were a global phenomenon the processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide there was something very different about the ediacaran period that permitted these delicate creatures to be left behind and it is thought the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand trapping them against the mud or microbial mats on which they lived 28 their preservation was possibly enhanced by the high concentration of silica in the oceans before silica-secreting organisms such as sponges and diatoms became prevalent 29 ash beds provide more detail and can readily be dated to the nearest million years or better using radiometric dating 30 however it is more common to find ediacaran fossils under sandy beds deposited by storms or high-energy bottom-scraping ocean currents known as turbidites 28 soft-bodied organisms today rarely fossilize during such events but the presence of widespread microbial mats probably aided preservation by stabilising their impressions in the sediment below 31 scale of preservation edit the rate of cementation of the overlying substrate relative to the rate of decomposition of the organism determines whether the top or bottom surface of an organism is preserved most disc-shaped fossils decomposed before the overlying sediment was cemented whereupon ash or sand slumped in to fill the void leaving a cast of the organism s underside conversely quilted fossils tended to decompose after the cementation of the overlying sediment hence their upper surfaces are preserved their more resistant nature is reflected in the fact that in rare occasions quilted fossils are found within storm beds as the high-energy sedimentation did not destroy them as it would have the less-resistant discs further in some cases the bacterial precipitation of minerals formed a death mask ultimately leaving a positive cast-like impression of the organism 32 33 morphology edit forms of ediacaran fossil the earliest discovered potential embryo preserved within an acanthomorphic acritarch the term acritarch describes a range of unclassified cell-like fossils tateana inflata cyclomedusa radiata is the attachment disk of an unknown organism a cast of the quilted charnia the first accepted complex precambrian organism charnia was once interpreted as a relative of the sea pens spriggina was originally interpreted as annelid or arthropod however lack of known limbs and glide reflected isomers instead of true segments rejects any such classification despite some superficial resemblance late ediacaran archaeonassa-type trace fossils are commonly preserved on the top surfaces of sandstone strata epibaion waggoneris chain of trace platforms and the imprint of the body of yorgia waggoneri right which created these traces on microbial mat the ediacaran biota exhibited a vast range of morphological characteristics size ranged from millimetres to metres complexity from blob-like to intricate rigidity from sturdy and resistant to jelly-soft almost all forms of symmetry were present 28 these organisms differed from earlier fossils by displaying an organised differentiated multicellular construction and centimetre-plus sizes these disparate morphologies can be broadly grouped into form taxa embryos recent discoveries of precambrian multicellular life have been dominated by reports of embryos particularly from the doushantuo formation in china some finds 34 generated intense media excitement 35 though some have claimed they are instead inorganic structures formed by the precipitation of minerals on the inside of a hole 36 other embryos have been interpreted as the remains of the giant sulfur-reducing bacteria akin to thiomargarita 37 a view that while it had enjoyed a notable gain of supporters 38 39 as of 2007 has since suffered following further research comparing the potential doushantuo embryos morphologies with those of thiomargarita specimens both living and in various stages of decay 40 microfossils dating from million years ago just 3 million years after the end of the cryogenian glaciations may represent embryonic resting stages in the life cycle of the earliest known animals 41 an alternative proposal is that these structures represent adult stages of the multicellular organisms of this period 42 discs circular fossils such as ediacaria cyclomedusa and rugoconites led to the initial identification of ediacaran fossils as cnidaria which include jellyfish and corals 15 further examination has provided alternative interpretations of all disc-shaped fossils not one is now confidently recognised as a jellyfish alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists 43 the patterns displayed where two meet have led to many individuals being identified as microbial colonies 44 45 and yet others may represent scratch marks formed as stalked organisms spun around their holdfasts 46 useful diagnostic characters are often lacking because only the underside of the organism is preserved by fossilisation bags fossils such as pteridinium preserved within sediment layers resemble mud-filled bags the scientific community is a long way from reaching a consensus on their interpretation 47 toroids the fossil vendoglossa tuberculata from the nama group namibia has been interpreted as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan with a large gut cavity and a transversely ridged ectoderm the organism is in the shape of a flattened torus with the long axis of its toroidal body running through the approximate center of the presumed gut cavity 48 quilted organisms the organisms considered in seilacher s revised definition of the vendobionta 8 share a quilted appearance and resembled an inflatable mattress sometimes these quilts would be torn or ruptured prior to preservation such damaged specimens provide valuable clues in the reconstruction process for example the three or more petaloid fronds of swartpuntia germsi could only be recognised in a posthumously damaged specimen usually multiple fronds were hidden as burial squashed the organisms flat 49 these organisms appear to form two groups the fractal rangeomorphs and the simpler erniettomorphs 50 including such fossils as the iconic charnia and swartpuntia the group is both the most iconic of the ediacaran biota and the most difficult to place within the existing tree of life lacking any mouth gut reproductive organs or indeed any evidence of internal anatomy their lifestyle was somewhat peculiar by modern standards the most widely accepted hypothesis holds that they sucked nutrients out of the surrounding seawater by osmotrophy 51 or osmosis 52 however others argue against this 53 non-ediacarans some ediacaran organisms have more complex details preserved which has allowed them to be interpreted as possible early forms of living phyla excluding them from some definitions of the ediacaran biota the earliest such fossil is the reputed bilaterian vernanimalcula claimed by some however to represent the infilling of an egg-sac or acritarch 36 54 later examples are almost universally accepted as bilaterians and include the mollusc-like kimberella 55 spriggina pictured 56 and the shield-shaped parvancorina 57 whose affinities are currently debated 58 a suite of fossils known as the small shelly fossils are represented in the ediacaran most famously by cloudina 59 a shelly tube-like fossil that often shows evidence of predatory boring suggesting that while predation may not have been common in the ediacaran period it was at least present representatives of modern taxa existed in the ediacaran some of which are recognisable today sponges red and green alg protists and bacteria are all easily recognisable with some pre-dating the ediacaran by nearly three billion years possible arthropods have also been described 60 trace fossils with the exception of some very simple vertical burrows 61 the only ediacaran burrows are horizontal lying on or just below the surface of the seafloor such burrows have been taken to imply the presence of motile organisms with heads which would probably have had a bilateral symmetry this could place them in the bilateral clade of animals 62 but they could also have been made by simpler organisms feeding as they slowly rolled along the sea floor 63 putative burrows dating as far back as million years may have been made by animals that fed on the undersides of microbial mats which would have shielded them from a chemically unpleasant ocean 64 however their uneven width and tapering ends make a biological origin so difficult to defend 65 that even the original proponent no longer believes they are authentic 66 the burrows observed imply simple behaviour and the complex efficient feeding traces common from the start of the cambrian are absent some ediacaran fossils especially discs have been interpreted tentatively as trace fossils but this hypothesis has not gained widespread acceptance as well as burrows some trace fossils have been found directly associated with an ediacaran fossil yorgia and dickinsonia are often found at the end of long pathways of trace fossils matching their shape 67 these fossils are thought to be associated with ciliary feeding but the precise method of formation of these disconnected and overlapping fossils largely remains a mystery 68 the potential mollusc kimberella is associated with scratch marks perhaps formed by a radula 69 classification and interpretation edit classification of the ediacarans is difficult and hence a variety of theories exist as to their placement on the tree of life martin glaessner proposed in the dawn of animal life 1984 that the ediacaran biota were recognizable crown group members of modern phyla but were unfamiliar because they had yet to evolve the characteristic features we use in modern classification 70 in 1998 mark mcmenamin claimed ediacarans did not possess an embryonic stage and thus could not be animals he believed that they independently evolved a nervous system and brains meaning that the path toward intelligent life was embarked upon more than once on this planet 43 a sea pen a modern cnidarian bearing a passing resemblance to charnia cnidarians edit since the most primitive eumetazoans multi-cellular animals with tissues are cnidarians the first attempt to categorise these fossils designated them as jellyfish and sea pens 71 however more recent discoveries have established that many of the circular forms formerly considered cnidarian medusa are actually holdfasts sand-filled vesicles occurring at the base of the stem of upright frond-like ediacarans a notable example is the form known as charniodiscus a circular impression later found to be attached to the long stem of a frond-like organism that now bears the name 72 73 the link between certain frond-like ediacarans and sea pens has been thrown into doubt by multiple lines of evidence chiefly the derived nature of the most frond-like pennatulacean octocorals their absence from the fossil record before the tertiary and the apparent cohesion between segments in ediacaran frond-like organisms 74 some researchers have suggested that an analysis of growth poles discredits the pennatulacean nature of ediacaran fronds 75 76 protozoans edit a single-celled xenophyophore in the galapagos rift adolf seilacher has suggested the ediacaran sees animals usurping giant protists as the dominant life form 77 the modern xenophyophores are giant single-celled protozoans found throughout the world s oceans largely on the abyssal plain a recent genetic study suggested that the xenophyophores are a specialised group of foraminifera there are approximately 42 recognised species in 13 genera and 2 orders one of which syringammina fragilissima is among the largest known protozoans at up to 20 centimetres in diameter new phylum edit seilacher has suggested that the ediacaran organisms represented a unique and extinct grouping of related forms descended from a common ancestor clade and created the kingdom vendozoa 78 79 named after the now-obsolete vendian era he later excluded fossils identified as metazoans and relaunched the phylum vendobionta he described the vendobionta as quilted cnidarians lacking stinging cells this absence precludes the current cnidarian method of feeding so seilacher suggested that the organisms may have survived by symbiosis with photosynthetic or chemoautotrophic organisms 80 mark mcmenamin saw such feeding strategies as characteristic for the entire biota and referred to the marine biota of this period as a garden of ediacara 81 lichen hypothesis edit a modern lichen hypogymnia the lichen hypothesis addresses unusual features in the fossil record from this epoch greg retallack s hypothesis that ediacaran organisms were lichens 82 83 is not widely accepted by the scientific community 84 85 he argues that the fossils are not as squashed as known fossil jellyfish and their relief is closer to compressed woody branches whose compaction can be estimated as compressed cylinders he points out the chitinous walls of lichen colonies would provide a similar resistance to compaction and claims the large size of the organisms up to 1.5 metres long far larger than any of the preserved burrows also hints against classification with animals finally ediacaran fossils from classic localities of the flinders ranges have been found in growth position within red calcareous and gypsiferous paleosols interpreted as soils of well-drained temperate desert soils 83 86 such habitats limit interpretive options for fractal ediacaran fossils such as dickinsonia to lichenised or unlichenised fungi but other ediacaran fossils could have been slime moulds or microbial colonies other interpretations edit several classifications have been used to accommodate the ediacaran biota at some point 87 from algae 88 to protozoans 89 to fungi 90 to bacterial or microbial colonies 44 to hypothetical intermediates between plants and animals 6 a new extant genus discovered in 2014 dendrogramma which appears to be a basal metazoan but of unknown taxonomic placement has been noted to have similarities with the ediacaran fauna 91 it has since been found to be a siphonophore possibly even sections of a more complex species 92 though this in turn has raised suspicions for a similar status for at least some ediacaran organisms origin edit it took almost 4 billion years from the formation of the earth for the ediacaran fossils to first appear 655 million years ago while putative fossils are reported from million years ago 93 94 the first uncontroversial evidence for life is found million years ago 95 and cells with nuclei certainly existed by million years ago 96 the reason why it took so long for forms with an ediacaran grade of organisation to appear is uncertain it could be that no special explanation is required the slow process of evolution simply required 4 billion years to accumulate the necessary adaptations indeed there does seem to be a slow increase in the maximum level of complexity seen over this time with more and more complex forms of life evolving as time progresses with traces of earlier semi-complex life such as nimbia found in the million year old twitya formation 97 and possibly older rocks dating to million years ago 98 possibly displaying the most complex morphology of the time global ice sheets may have delayed or prevented the establishment of multicellular life the alternative train of thought is that it was simply not advantageous to be large until the appearance of the ediacarans the environment favoured the small over the large examples of such scenarios today include plankton whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms but for large size never to be favourable the environment would have to be very different indeed a primary size-limiting factor is the amount of atmospheric oxygen without a complex circulatory system low concentrations of oxygen cannot reach the centre of an organism quickly enough to supply its metabolic demand on the early earth reactive elements such as iron and uranium existed in a reduced form that would react with any free oxygen produced by photosynthesising organisms oxygen would not be able to build up in the atmosphere until all the iron had rusted producing banded iron formations and all the other reactive elements had been oxidised donald canfield detected records of the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first ediacaran fossils appeared 99 and the presence of atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the ediacaran radiation 100 oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses the rise of small sessile stationary organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation 101 however the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the early cambrian and the cretaceous 102 periods of intense cold have also been suggested as a barrier to the evolution of multicellular life the earliest known embryos from china s doushantuo formation appear just a million years after the earth emerged from a global glaciation suggesting that ice cover and cold oceans may have prevented the emergence of multicellular life 103 potentially complex life may have evolved before these glaciations and been wiped out however the diversity of life in modern antarctica has sparked disagreement over whether cold temperatures increase or decrease the rate of evolution in early 2008 a team analysed the range of basic body structures disparity of ediacaran organisms from three different fossil beds avalon in canada to million years ago white sea in russia to million years ago and nama in namibia to million years ago immediately before the start of the cambrian they found that while the white sea assemblage had the most species there was no significant difference in disparity between the three groups and concluded that before the beginning of the avalon timespan these organisms must have gone through their own evolutionary explosion which may have been similar to the famous cambrian explosion 104 preservation bias edit the paucity of ediacaran fossils after the cambrian could simply be due to conditions that no longer favoured the fossilisation of ediacaran organisms which may have continued to thrive unpreserved 25 however if they were common more than the occasional specimen 5 105 might be expected in exceptionally preserved fossil assemblages konservat-lagerst tten such as the burgess shale and chengjiang 106 there are at present no widely accepted reports of ediacara-type organisms in the cambrian period though there are a few disputed reports as well as unpublished observations of vendobiont fossils from 535 ma orsten-type deposits in china 107 kimberella may have had a predatory or grazing lifestyle predation and grazing edit it is suggested that by the early cambrian organisms higher in the food chain caused the microbial mats to largely disappear if these grazers first appeared as the ediacaran biota started to decline then it may suggest that they destabilised the microbial substrate leading to displacement or detachment of the biota or that the destruction of the mat destabilised the ecosystem causing extinctions alternatively skeletonised animals could have fed directly on the relatively undefended ediacaran biota 43 however if the interpretation of the ediacaran age kimberella as a grazer is correct then this suggests that the biota had already had limited exposure to predation 55 there is however little evidence for any trace fossils in the ediacaran period which may speak against the active grazing theory further the onset of the cambrian period is defined by the appearance of a worldwide trace fossil assemblage quite distinct from the activity-barren ediacaran period cambrian animals such as waptia may have competed with or fed upon ediacaran life-forms competition edit it is possible that increased competition due to the evolution of key innovations among other groups perhaps as a response to predation 108 drove the ediacaran biota from their niches however this argument has not successfully explained similar phenomena for instance the bivalve molluscs competitive exclusion of brachiopods was eventually deemed to be a coincidental result of two unrelated trends 109 change in environmental conditions edit while it is difficult to infer the effect of changing planetary conditions on organisms communities and ecosystems great changes were happening at the end of the precambrian and the start of the early cambrian the breakup of the supercontinents 110 rising sea levels creating shallow life-friendly seas 111 a nutrient crisis 112 fluctuations in atmospheric composition including oxygen and carbon dioxide levels 113 and changes in ocean chemistry 114 promoting biomineralisation 115 could all have played a part assemblages edit ediacaran-type fossils are recognised globally in 25 localities 23 and a variety of depositional conditions and are commonly grouped into three main types known as assemblages and named after typical localities each assemblage tends to occupy its own region of morphospace and after an initial burst of diversification changes little for the rest of its existence 116 avalon-type assemblage edit the avalon-type assemblage is defined at mistaken point in canada the oldest locality with a large quantity of ediacaran fossils 117 the assemblage is easily dated because it contains many fine ash-beds which are a good source of zircons used in the uranium-lead method of radiometric dating these fine-grained ash beds also preserve exquisite detail constituents of this biota appear to survive through until the extinction of all ediacarans at the base of the cambrian 116 the biota comprises deep-sea-dwelling rangeomorphs 118 such as charnia all of which share a fractal growth pattern they were probably preserved in situ without post-mortem transportation although this point is not universally accepted the assemblage while less diverse than the ediacara- or nama-types resembles carboniferous suspension-feeding communities which may suggest filter feeding 119 by most interpretations the assemblage is found in water too deep for photosynthesis the low diversity may reflect the depth of water which would restrict speciation opportunities or it may just be too young for a rich biota to have evolved opinion is currently divided between these conflicting hypotheses 120 ediacara-type assemblage edit the ediacara-type assemblage is named after australia s ediacara hills and consists of fossils preserved in facies of coastal lagoons and rivers they are typically found in red gypsiferous and calcareous paleosols formed on loess and flood deposits in an arid cool temperate paleoclimate 83 most fossils are preserved as imprints in microbial earths 121 but a few are preserved within sandy units 120 116 biota ranges 120 view title discussion about this template talk axis scale millions of years ago dated with u pb of zircons nama-type assemblage edit the nama assemblage is best represented in namibia three-dimensional preservation is most common with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing internal bedding dima grazhdankin believes that these fossils represent burrowing organisms 47 while guy narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers 122 these beds are sandwiched between units comprising interbedded sandstones siltstones and shales with microbial mats where present usually containing the fossils the environment is interpreted as sand bars formed at the mouth of a delta s distributaries 120 significance of assemblages edit in the white sea region of russia all three assemblage types have been found in close proximity this and the faunas considerable temporal overlap makes it unlikely that they represent evolutionary stages or temporally distinct communities since they are globally distributed described on all continents except antarctica geographical boundaries do not appear to be a factor 123 the same fossils are found at all palaeolatitudes the latitude where the fossil was created accounting for continental drift and in separate sedimentary basins 120 it is most likely that the three assemblages mark organisms adapted to survival in different environments and that any apparent patterns in diversity or age are in fact an artefact of the few samples that have been discovered the timeline right demonstrates the paucity of ediacaran fossil-bearing assemblages an analysis of one of the white sea fossil beds where the layers cycle from continental seabed to inter-tidal to estuarine and back again a few times found that a specific set of ediacaran organisms was associated with each environment 120 as the ediacaran biota represent an early stage in multicellular life s history it is unsurprising that not all possible modes of life are occupied it has been estimated that of 92 potentially possible modes of life combinations of feeding style tiering and motility no more than a dozen are occupied by the end of the ediacaran just four are represented in the avalon assemblage 124 the lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity the emergence of these during the early cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30 see also edit cambrian explosion list of ediacaran genera origin of life notes edit simple multicellular organisms such as red algae evolved at least million years ago the status of the
