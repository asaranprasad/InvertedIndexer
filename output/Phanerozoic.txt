english phan rozoic is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed it covers 541 million years to the present 4 and began with the cambrian period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared its name was derived from the ancient greek words phaner s and z meaning visible life since it was once believed that life began in the cambrian the first period of this eon the time before the phanerozoic called the precambrian supereon is now divided into the hadean archaean and proterozoic eons the time span of the phanerozoic starts with the rapid emergence of a number of animal phyla the evolution of those phyla into diverse forms the emergence and development of complex plants the evolution of fish the emergence of insects and tetrapods and the development of modern fauna land plant life appeared in the early phanerozoic eon during this time span tectonic forces caused the continents to move and eventually collect into a single landmass known as pangaea which then separated into the current continental landmasses contents 1 proterozoic-phanerozoic boundary 2 eras of the phanerozoic 2.1

how and when to remove this template message the proterozoic-phanerozoic boundary is at 541 million years ago in the 19th century the boundary was set at time of appearance of the first abundant animal metazoan fossils but several hundred groups taxa of metazoa of the earlier proterozoic era have been identified since the systematic study of those forms started in the 1950s most geologists and paleontologists would probably set the proterozoic-phanerozoic boundary either at the classic point where the first trilobites and reef-building animals archaeocyatha such as corals and others appear at the first appearance of a complex feeding burrow called treptichnus pedum or at the first appearance of a group of small generally disarticulated armored forms termed the small shelly fauna the three different dividing points are within a few million years of each other in the older literature the term phanerozoic is generally used as a label for the time period of interest to paleontologists but that use of the term seems to be falling into disuse in more modern literature eras of the phanerozoic edit the phanerozoic is divided into three eras the paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic which are further subdivided into 12 periods the paleozoic features the rise of fish amphibians and reptiles the mesozoic is ruled by the reptiles and features the evolution of mammals birds and more famously dinosaurs the cenozoic is the time of the mammals and more recently humans paleozoic era edit the paleozoic is a time in earth s history when complex life forms evolved took their first breath of oxygen on dry land and when the forerunners of all life on earth began to diversify there are six periods in the paleozoic era cambrian ordovician silurian devonian carboniferous and permian 5 cambrian period edit trilobites the cambrian is the first period of the paleozoic era and starts from million years ago the cambrian sparked a rapid expansion in evolution in an event known as the cambrian explosion during which the greatest number of creatures evolved in a single period in the history of earth plants like algae evolved and the fauna was dominated by armored arthropods such as trilobites almost all marine phyla evolved in this period during this time the super-continent pannotia began to break up most of which later recombined into the super-continent gondwana 6 ordovician period edit cephalaspis a jawless fish the ordovician spans from 485 million years to 440 million years ago the ordovician was a time in earth s history in which many species still prevalent today evolved such as primitive fish cephalopods and coral the most common forms of life however were trilobites snails and shellfish more importantly the first arthropods crept ashore to colonize gondwana a continent empty of animal life by the end of the ordovican gondwana had moved from the equator to the south pole and laurentia had collided with baltica closing the iapetus ocean the glaciation of gondwana resulted in a major drop in sea level killing off all life that had established along its coast glaciation caused a snowball earth leading to the ordovician-silurian extinction during which 60 of marine invertebrates and 25 of families became extinct this is considered the first mass extinction and the second deadliest in the history of earth 7 silurian period edit the silurian spans from 440 million years to 415 million years ago which saw a warming from snowball earth this period saw the mass evolution of fish as jaw-less fish became more numerous jawed fish evolved and the first freshwater fish evolved though arthropods such as sea scorpions remained the apex predators fully terrestrial life evolved which included early arachnids fungi and centipedes the evolution of vascular plants cooksonia allowed plants to gain a foothold on land these early terrestrial plants are the forerunners of all plant life on land during this time there were four continents gondwana africa south america australia antarctica india laurentia north america with parts of europe baltica the rest of europe and siberia northern asia the recent rise in sea levels provided new habitats for many new species 8 devonian period edit eogyrinus an amphibian of the carboniferous the devonian spans from 415 million years to 360 million years ago also known as the age of the fish the devonian features a huge diversification in fish including armored fish like dunkleosteus and lobe-finned fish which eventually evolved into the first tetrapods on land plant groups diversified incredibly in an event known as the devonian explosion during which the first trees evolved as well as seeds this event also allowed the diversification of arthropod life as they took advantage of the new habitat the first amphibians also evolved and the fish were now at the top of the food chain near the end of the devonian 70 of all species became extinct in an event known as the late devonian extinction which is the second mass extinction known to have happened 9 carboniferous period edit dimetrodon the carboniferous spans from 360 million to 300 million years ago during this period average global temperatures were exceedingly high the early carboniferous averaged at about 20 degrees celsius but cooled to 10 degrees during the middle carboniferous 10 tropical swamps dominated the earth and the large amounts of trees created much of the carbon that became coal deposits hence the name carboniferous the high oxygen levels caused by these swamps allowed massive arthropods normally limited in size by their respiratory systems to proliferate perhaps the most important evolutionary development of the time was the evolution of amniotic eggs which allowed amphibians to move farther inland and remain the dominant vertebrates throughout the period also the first reptiles and synapsids evolved in the swamps throughout the carboniferous there was a cooling pattern which eventually led to the glaciation of gondwana as much of it was situated around the south pole in an event known as the permo-carboniferous glaciation or the carboniferous rainforest collapse 11 permian period edit the permian spans from 300 million to 250 million years ago and was the last period of the paleozoic era at its beginning all continents came together to form the super-continent pangaea surrounded by one ocean called panthalassa the earth was very dry during this time with harsh seasons as the climate of the interior of pangaea wasn t regulated by large bodies of water reptiles and synapsids flourished in the new dry climate creatures such as dimetrodon and edaphosaurus ruled the new continent the first conifers evolved then dominated the terrestrial landscape nearing the end of the period scutosaurus and gorgonopsids filled the empty desert eventually they disappeared along with 95 of all life on earth in an event simply known as the great dying the world s third mass extinction event and the largest in its history 12 13 mesozoic era edit the mesozoic ranges from 252 million to 66 million years ago also known as the age of the dinosaurs the mesozoic features the rise of reptiles on their 150 million year conquest of the earth on the land in the seas and in the air there are three periods in the mesozoic triassic jurassic and cretaceous triassic period edit the triassic ranges from 250 million to 200 million years ago the triassic is a desolate transitional time in earth s history between the permian extinction and the lush jurassic period it has three major epochs early triassic middle triassic and late triassic 14 the early triassic lasted between 250 million to 247 million years ago and was dominated by deserts as pangaea had not yet broken up thus the interior was arid the earth had just witnessed a massive die-off in which 95 of all life became extinct the most common life on earth were lystrosaurus labyrinthodonts and euparkeria along with many other creatures that managed to survive the great dying temnospondyli evolved during this time and would be the dominant predator for much of the triassic 15 plateosaurus a prosauropod the middle triassic spans from 247 million to 237 million years ago the middle triassic featured the beginnings of the breakup of pangaea and the beginning of the tethys sea the ecosystem had recovered from the devastation of the great dying phytoplankton coral and crustaceans all had recovered and the reptiles began increasing in size new aquatic reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and nothosaurs evolved meanwhile on land pine forests flourished as well as mosquitoes and fruit flies the first ancient crocodilians evolved which sparked competition with the large amphibians that had long ruled the freshwater world 16 the late triassic spans from 237 million to 200 million years ago following the bloom of the middle triassic the late triassic featured frequent rises of temperature as well as moderate precipitation 10-20 inches per year the recent warming led to a boom of reptilian evolution on land as the first true dinosaurs evolved as well as pterosaurs the climactic change however resulted in a large die-out known as the triassic-jurassic extinction event in which all archosaurs excluding ancient crocodiles synapsids and almost all large amphibians became extinct as well as 34 of marine life in the fourth mass extinction event the extinction s cause is debated 17 18 jurassic period edit rhamphorhynchus the jurassic ranges from 200 million to 145 million years ago and features three major epochs early jurassic middle jurassic and late jurassic 19 the early jurassic epoch spans from 200 million to 175 million years ago 19 the climate was much more humid than the triassic and as a result the world was very tropical in the oceans plesiosaurs ichthyosaurs and ammonites dominanted the seas on land dinosaurs and other reptiles dominated the land with species such as dilophosaurus at the apex the first true crocodiles evolved pushing the large amphibians to near extinction the reptiles rose to rule the world meanwhile the first true mammals evolved but never exceeded the height of a shrew 20 the middle jurassic epoch spans from 175 million to 163 million years ago 19 during this epoch reptiles flourished as huge herds of sauropods such as brachiosaurus and diplodicus filled the fern prairies of the middle jurassic many other predators rose as well such as allosaurus conifer forests made up a large portion of the world s forests in the oceans plesiosaurs were quite common and ichthyosaurs were flourishing this epoch was the peak of the reptiles 21 artist s 1901 depiction of a stegosaurus inaccurately portrayed with a dragging tail the late jurassic epoch spans from 163 million to 145 million years ago 19 the late jurassic featured a massive extinction of sauropods and ichthyosaurs due to the separation of pangaea into laurasia and gondwana in an extinction known as the jurassic-cretaceous extinction sea levels rose destroying fern prairies and creating shallows ichthyosaurs became extinct whereas sauropods as a whole did not in fact some species like titanosaurus lived until the k-t extinction 22 the increase in sea-levels opened up the atlantic sea way which would continue to get larger over time the divided world would give opportunity for the diversification of new dinosaurs cretaceous period edit the cretaceous is the longest period in the mesozoic spans from 145 million to 66 million years ago and is divided into two epochs early cretaceous and late cretaceous 23 tylosaurus a mosasaur hunting xiphactinus the early cretaceous epoch spans from 145 million to 100 million years ago 23 the early cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways and as a result the decline and extinction of sauropods except in south america many coastal shallows were created and that caused ichthyosaurs to die out mosasaurs evolved to replace them as apex species of the seas some island-hopping dinosaurs like eustreptospondylus evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient europe other dinosaurs such as carcharodontosaurus and spinosaurus rose to fill the empty space that the jurassic-cretaceous extinction had created of the most successful would be the iguanodon which spread to every continent seasons came back into effect and the poles grew seasonally colder dinosaurs such as the leaellynasaura inhabited the polar forests year-round while many dinosaurs such as the muttaburrasaurus migrated there during summer since it was too cold for crocodiles it was the last stronghold for large amphibians such as the koolasuchus pterosaurs grew larger as species like tapejara and ornithocheirus evolved more importantly the first true birds evolved sparking competition between them and the pterosaurs the late cretaceous epoch spans from 100 million to 65 million years ago 23 the late cretaceous featured a cooling trend that would continue into the cenozoic era eventually tropical ecology was restricted to the equator and areas beyond the tropic lines featured extreme seasonal changes of weather dinosaurs still thrived as new species such as tyrannosaurus ankylosaurus triceratops and hadrosaurs dominated the food web pterosaurs however were going into a decline as birds took to the skies the last pterosaur to die off was quetzalcoatlus marsupials evolved within the large conifer forests as scavengers in the oceans mosasaurs ruled the seas to fill the role of the ichthyosaurs and huge plesiosaurs such as elasmosaurus evolved also the first flowering plants evolved at the end of the cretaceous the deccan traps and other volcanic eruptions were poisoning the atmosphere as this was continued it is thought that a large meteor smashed into earth creating the chicxulub crater creating the event known as the k-t extinction the fifth and most recent mass extinction event during which 75 of life on earth became extinct including all non-avian dinosaurs every living thing with a body mass over 10 kilograms became extinct and the age of the dinosaurs came to an end 24 25 cenozoic era edit the cenozoic featured the rise of mammals as the dominant class of animals as the end of the age of the dinosaurs left significant evolutionary vacuums there are three divisions of the cenozoic paleogene neogene and quaternary paleogene period edit the paleogene spans from the extinction of the dinosaurs some 66 million years ago to the dawn of the neogene 23 million years ago it features three epochs paleocene eocene and oligocene basilosaurus a whale despite the name the paleocene epoch began with the k-t extinction event caused by the impact of a metorite in the area of present-day yucatan peninsula and caused the destruction of 75 of all species on earth the early paleocene saw the recovery of the earth from that event the continents began to take their modern shape but all continents and india were separated from each other afro-eurasia was separated by the tethys sea and the americas were separated by the strait of panama as the isthmus of panama had not yet formed this epoch featured a general warming trend and jungles eventually reached the poles the oceans were dominated by sharks as the large reptiles that had once ruled became extinct archaic mammals such as creodonts and early primates that evolved during the mesozoic filled the world during this time there were no land creatures over 10 kilograms mammals were still quite small 26 the eocene epoch ranged from 56 million to 34 million years ago in the early eocene land animals were small and living in cramped jungles much like the paleocene none had a mass over 10 kilograms 27 among them were early primates whales and horses along with many other early forms of mammals at the top of the food chains were huge birds such as gastornis it is the only time in recorded history that birds ruled the world excluding their ancestors the dinosaurs the temperature was 30 degrees celsius with little temperature gradient from pole to pole in the middle eocene epoch the circum-antarctic current between australia and antarctica formed which disrupted ocean currents worldwide resulting in global cooling and caused the jungles to shrink this allowed mammals to grow some such as whales to mammoth proportions which were by now almost fully aquatic mammals like andrewsarchus were now at the top of the food-chain and sharks were replaced by basilosaurus whales as rulers of the seas the late eocene epoch saw the rebirth of seasons which caused the expansion of savanna-like areas along with the evolution of grass 28 29 the oligocene epoch spans from 33 million to 23 million years ago the oligocene featured the expansion of grass which had led to many new species to take advantage including the first elephants cats dogs marsupials and many other species still prevalent today many other species of plants evolved during this epoch also such as the evergreen trees the long term cooling continued and seasonal rains patterns established mammals continued to grow larger paraceratherium the largest land mammal to ever live evolved during this epoch along with many other perissodactyls in an event known as the eocene oligocene extinction event grand coupure 30 neogene period edit animals of the miocene chalicotherium hyenadon entelodont the neogene spans from 23.03 million to 2.58 million years ago it features 2 epochs the miocene and the pliocene 31 the miocene spans from 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago and is a period in which grass spread further across effectively dominating a large portion of the world diminishing forests in the process kelp forests evolved leading to the evolution of new species such as sea otters during this time perissodactyla thrived and evolved into many different varieties alongside them were the apes which evolved into a 30 species overall arid and mountainous land dominated most of the world as did grazers the tethys sea finally closed with the creation of the arabian peninsula and in its wake left the black red mediterranean and caspian seas this only increased aridity many new plants evolved and 95 of modern seed plants evolved in the mid-miocene 32 the pliocene lasted from 5.333 to 2.58 million years ago the pliocene featured dramatic climactic changes which ultimately led to modern species and plants the mediterranean sea dried up for several million years along with these major geological events australopithecus evolved in africa beginning the human branch the isthmus of panama formed and animals migrated between north and south america wreaking havoc on the local ecology climatic changes brought savannas that are still continuing to spread across the world indian monsoons deserts in east asia and the beginnings of the sahara desert the earth s continents and seas moved into their present shapes the world map has not changed much since save for changes brought about by the glaciations of the quaternary such as the great lakes 33 34 quaternary period edit the quaternary spans from 2.58 million years ago to present day and is the shortest geological period in the phanerozoic eon it features modern animals and dramatic changes in the climate it is divided into two epochs the pleistocene and the holocene megafauna of the pleistocene mammoths cave lions woolly rhino reindeer horses the pleistocene lasted from 2.58 million to 11,700 years ago this epoch was marked by ice ages as a result of the cooling trend that started in the mid-eocene there were at least four separate glaciation periods marked by the advance of ice caps as far south as 40 degrees n latitude in mountainous areas meanwhile africa experienced a trend of desiccation which resulted in the creation of the sahara namib and kalahari deserts many animals evolved including mammoths giant ground sloths dire wolves saber-toothed cats and most famously homo sapiens 100,000 years ago marked the end of one of the worst droughts of africa and led to the expansion of primitive man as the pleistocene drew to a close a major extinction wiped out much of the world s megafauna including some of the hominid species such as neanderthals all the continents were affected but africa to a lesser extent that continent retains many large animals such as hippos 35 the holocene began 11,700 years ago and lasts until to present day all recorded history and the history of the world lies within the boundaries of the holocene epoch 36 human activity is blamed for a mass extinction that began roughly 10,000 years ago though the species becoming extinct have only been recorded since the industrial revolution this is sometimes referred to as the sixth extinction more than 322 species have become extinct due to human activity since the industrial revolution 37 38 biodiversity edit during the phanerozoic biodiversity shows a steady but not monotonic increase from near zero to several thousands of genera it has been demonstrated that changes in biodiversity through the phanerozoic correlate much better with the hyperbolic model widely used in demography and macrosociology than with exponential and logistic models traditionally used in population biology and extensively applied to fossil biodiversity as well the latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback more ancestors more descendants or a negative feedback that arises from resource limitation or both the hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback the hyperbolic pattern of the human population growth arises from a second-order positive feedback caused by the interaction of the population size and the rate of technological growth 39 the character of biodiversity growth in the phanerozoic eon can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between the diversity and community structure complexity it is suggested that the similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the superposition on the hyperbolic trend of cyclical and random dynamics 39 see also edit paleoclimatology notes edit oxford dictionaries oxford university press retrieved 2016-01-20
