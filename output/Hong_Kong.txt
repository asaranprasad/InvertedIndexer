the southern coast of hong kong island the town of aberdeen was an initial point of contact between british sailors and local fishermen 34 the source of the romanised name is not known but it is generally believed to be an early imprecise phonetic rendering of the spoken cantonese pronunciation of cantonese yale h ung g ng which means fragrant harbour or incense harbour 32 33 35 fragrance may refer to the sweet taste of the harbour s fresh water influx from the pearl river estuary or to the incense from factories lining the coast of northern kowloon the incense was stored near aberdeen harbour for export before victoria harbour was developed 35 another theory is that the name originates from the tanka early inhabitants of the region it is equally probable that a romanisation of the name in their dialect was used i e h ng not h ung in cantonese 36 regardless of origin the name was recorded in the treaty of nanking to encompass all of hong kong island and has been used to refer to the territory in its entirety ever since 37 the name had often been written as the single word hongkong until the government adopted the current form in 1926 38 nevertheless a number of institutions founded during the early colonial era still retain the single-word form such as the hongkong post hongkong electric and the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation history prehistory archaeological studies show a human presence in the chek lap kok area from 35,000 to 39,000 years ago and on sai kung peninsula from 6,000 years ago 39 40 41 wong tei tung and three fathoms cove are the earliest sites of human habitation in hong kong during the paleolithic period it is believed that the three fathom cove was a river-valley settlement and wong tei tung was a lithic manufacturing site excavated neolithic artefacts suggested cultural differences from the longshan culture of northern china and settlement by the che people prior to the migration of the baiyue to hong kong 42 43 eight petroglyphs dating to the shang dynasty were discovered on the surrounding islands 44 imperial china in 214 bce the qin dynasty conquered the baiyue tribes in jiaozhi modern-day liangguang region and vietnam and incorporated the area of hong kong into china for the first time 45 after a brief period of centralisation and subsequent collapse of the qin dynasty the area of hong kong was consolidated under the nanyue kingdom founded by general zhao tuo in 204 bce 46 after the han conquered nanyue in 111 bce hong kong was assigned to the jiaozhi commandery archaeological evidence indicates an increase of population and expansion of salt production the lei cheng uk han tomb on the kowloon peninsula is believed to have been built as a burial site during the han dynasty 47 sung wong toi believed to be a memorial to the last two boy emperors of the southern song dynasty as it appeared before the second sino-japanese war during the tang dynasty the guangdong region flourished as an international trading centre a military stronghold was established in tuen mun to strengthen defence of the coastal area 48 lantau island was a salt production centre and smuggler riots occasionally broke out against the government the first village school li ying college was established around 1075 ce in the modern-day new territories by the song dynasty 49 during their war against the mongols the southern song court was briefly stationed at modern-day kowloon city the sung wong toi site before their ultimate defeat at the battle of yamen in 1279 50 the earliest european visitor on record was jorge lvares a portuguese explorer who arrived in 1513 51 52 having established a settlement in a site they called tam o in hong kong waters portuguese merchants began regularly trading in southern china however subsequent military clashes between china and portugal led to the expulsion of all portuguese merchants in the 1520s 53 the portuguese were able to reestablish trade relations by 1549 with annual trade missions sent to shangchuan island and acquired a land lease from ming authorities in 1557 to establish a permanent trade outpost at macau 54 after the qing conquest hong kong was directly affected by the great clearance an imperial decree that ordered the evacuation of coastal areas of guangdong from 1661 to 1669 as part of the new dynasty s efforts against ming loyalist rebels in southern china over 16,000 inhabitants of xin an county which included hong kong were forced to migrate inland roughly only 10 of those who had evacuated returned in subsequent years 55 with frequent pirate attacks and ever increasing incursions by european explorers forts were constructed at tung chung and the kowloon walled city to guard the region 56 though maritime trade had previously been banned after repopulation of the coast and final defeat of all rebels with ming sympathies the kangxi emperor lifted the trade prohibition in 1684 and allowed foreigners to enter chinese ports 57 trade with europeans was more strictly regulated and became concentrated in the pearl river delta after establishment of the canton system in 1757 which forbade non-russian ships from northern chinese ports and forced all commerce to be conducted solely in the port of canton just north of hong kong 58 while european demand for chinese commodities like tea silk and porcelain was high chinese interest in european manufactured goods was comparatively negligible creating a large trade imbalance between qing china and great britain to counter this deficit the british began to sell increasingly large volumes of indian opium to china 59 faced with a drug addiction crisis 60 chinese officials pursued ever more aggressive actions in an attempt to halt the opium trade 59 british colony hong kong island and the city of victoria 1860s in 1839 the daoguang emperor having rejected proposals to legalise and tax opium tasked imperial commissioner lin zexu with eradicating the opium trade lin ordered the confiscation and destruction of all opium stockpiles in canton and a general blockade of foreign trade 61 the british objected to the sudden seizure especially without monetary compensation for the seized product and dispatched an expeditionary force to china starting the first opium war after british victory in the second battle of chuenpi the qing initially admitted defeat as part of a ceasefire agreement between captain charles elliot and qishan viceroy of liangguang hong kong island was declared to be ceded under the convention of chuenpi british forces took formal possession of the island on 26 january 1841 however disputes between high-ranking officials of both countries prevented the treaty s ratification 62 after over a year of further hostilities hong kong island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the united kingdom under the terms of the treaty of nanking on 29 august 1842 63 the british officially established a crown colony and founded the city of victoria in the following year 64 queen s road central at the junction of duddell street c 1900 the population of hong kong island was 7,450 when the union jack was raised over possession point on 26 january 1841 it mostly consisted of tanka fishermen and hakka charcoal burners whose settlements scattered along several coastal hamlets in the 1850s a large number of chinese refugees fleeing the taiping rebellion crossed the open border natural disasters such as flooding typhoons and famine in mainland china further established hong kong as a place of shelter 65 66 further conflicts over the opium trade between the british and qing quickly escalated into the second opium war following the anglo-french victory the colony was expanded to include kowloon peninsula south of present-day boundary street and stonecutter s island both of which were ceded to the british in perpetuity under the convention of beijing in 1860 the colony was expanded further in 1898 when britain obtained a 99-year lease of additional territory from the qing under the convention for the extension of hong kong territory lantau island the remainder of kowloon north of boundary street further territory beyond kowloon up to the sham chun river and over 200 other outlying islands were given over to british control 67 68 hong kong soon became a major entrep t thanks to its free port status attracting new immigrants from both china and europe however the population remained racially divided and polarised under early british colonial policies despite the rise of a british-educated chinese upper class by the late 19th century zoning laws prevented ethnic chinese from acquiring property in reserved areas though enacted ostensibly to address health concerns of european residents 69 the peak reservation ordinance and other similar pieces of legislation enforced a system of residential zoning that racially segregated the population of the colony creating exclusive communities of europeans in areas like victoria peak and cheung chau 70 71 at this time the majority of the chinese population in hong kong had no political representation in the british colonial government the british governors did rely however on a small number of chinese elites including sir kai ho and robert hotung who served as ambassadors and mediators between the government and local population chinese appointments to the legislative council and executive council were not made until 1880 and 1926 with wu tingfang and shouson chow serving as the first members of the colony s ethnic majority on the respective chambers 72 73 play media hong kong filmed in 1937 the colony continued to experience modest growth during the first half of the 20th century the university of hong kong was established in 1911 as the territory s first higher education institute during the first world war many chinese residents left the city fearing a german attack on the colony 74 hong kong ultimately remained unscathed and continued growing its population increased from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925 and reached 1.6 million by 1941 75 kai tak airport entered operation in 1925 and the colony was able to avoid a prolonged economic downturn after the canton hong kong strike ended which had lasted for more than a year from 1925 through 1926 76 77 78 at the outbreak of the second sino-japanese war in 1937 when the empire of japan invaded china from its protectorate in manchuria governor geoffry northcote declared the colony a neutral zone to safeguard hong kong s status as a free port 79 japanese military occupation liberation of hong kong in 1945 picture taken at the cenotaph in central on 8 december 1941 the same morning as the attack on pearl harbor the imperial japanese army moved south from guangzhou and crossed the sham chun river to attack hong kong as part of a coordinated military offensive against the allied powers 80 the battle of hong kong lasted for 17 days through which british canadian indian and local colonial units defended the territory by the fifth day commonwealth troops under heavy artillery and aerial bombardment had been forced to abandon their positions in kowloon and retreated to hong kong island 81 with the remaining troops unable to further mount an effective defence governor young surrendered the colony on christmas day this day is remembered by locals as black christmas 82 during the occupation the garrisoned japanese soldiers committed many atrocities against both civilians and prisoners of war including the st stephen s college massacre local residents suffered widespread food shortages strict rationing and hyperinflation arising from the forced exchange of currency from hong kong dollars to japanese military yen widespread starvation and forced deportation of residents to mainland china for use as slave labour drastically reduced the population of the city from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945 83 some residents were able to flee to nearby macau which was comparatively untouched by the japanese as a colony of neutral portugal with a few of these refugees further managing to find passage from there to allied territory 84 britain resumed control of the colony shortly after the surrender of japan on 30 august 1945 after almost four years of occupation 85 post-war industrialisation flag of british hong kong from 1959 to 1997 hong kong s population recovered quickly after the war as a wave of skilled migrants from the republic of china sought refuge from the chinese civil war in a territory neutral to the conflict when the communist party took full control of mainland china in 1949 even more refugees fled across the open border in fear of persecution 67 many newcomers especially those who had been based in the major port cities of shanghai and guangzhou established corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses and shifted their base operations to hong kong 67 the establishment of the people s republic of china caused the british colonial government to reconsider hong kong s open border to mainland china in 1951 a boundary zone was demarcated as a buffer zone against potential military attacks from communist china 86 the border was actively patrolled to regulate the movement of people and goods into and out of the territory 87 hong kong in 1965 in the 1950s hong kong became the first of the four asian tiger economies to undergo rapid industrialisation driven by textile exports manufacturing industries and re-exports of goods to china as the population grew with labour costs remaining low living standards began to rise steadily 88 the construction of the shek kip mei estate in 1953 marked the beginning of the public housing estate programme which provided shelter for the less privileged and helped cope with the continuing influx of immigrants under governor murray maclehose the government began a series of reforms to improve the quality of infrastructure and public services through the 1970s systemic corruption in the uniformed services had crippled trust in the government maclehose established the icac an independent security service under the direct authority of the governor to restore the integrity of the civil service 89 chinese was recognised as an official language during his tenure accelerating the process of localisation in the government slowly handing key official posts long held only by british members of the government over to local ethnic chinese people 10 90 to alleviate road traffic congestion and provide a more reliable means of crossing the victoria harbour the mass transit railway was constructed and began operations of its first line in 1979 the island line kwun tong line and tsuen wan line all opened in the early 1980s connecting hong kong island kowloon and parts of the new territories to a single transport system 91 maclehose was the longest-serving colonial governor and by the end of his governorship had become one of the most popular and well-known figures in the territory maclehose laid the foundation for hong kong to establish itself as a key global city in the 1980s and early 1990s 92 since 1983 the value of the hong kong dollar has been pegged to that of the united states dollar the territory s competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due to rising labour and property costs as well as new industrial capacity developed in southern china under the 1978 open door policy nevertheless by the early 1990s hong kong had established itself as a global financial centre a regional hub for logistics and freight one of the fastest-growing economies in asia and the world s exemplar of laissez-faire market policy 93 an aerial view of the northern shore of hong kong island in 1986 the hong kong issue in 1971 china s permanent seat on the united nations security council was transferred from the republic of china which had evacuated to taiwan at the conclusion of the chinese civil war to the people s republic of china hong kong was soon after removed from the organisation s list of non-self-governing territories at the request of the prc facing an uncertain future for the colony and the expiration of the new territories lease beyond 1997 governor maclehose raised the question of hong kong s status with deng xiaoping in 1979 94 diplomatic negotiations with china resulted in the sino-british joint declaration in 1984 the united kingdom agreed to transfer to china the entirety of the colony including the perpetually ceded areas of hong kong island and kowloon peninsula at the conclusion of the 99-year new territories lease in 1997 hong kong would then become a special administrative region governed separately from the mainland retaining its free-market economy common law judicial system independent representation in international organisations treaty arrangements and self-governance in all areas except foreign diplomacy and military defence the treaty further stipulated that the territory would be guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the transfer with the basic law of hong kong serving as its constitutional document 67 a street at the edge of the kowloon walled city at night under the terms of the second convention of peking the colony was expanded out to the new territories but the treaty did not include a small military outpost over which the kowloon walled city would later be built after the end of japanese occupation thousands of refugees fleeing from the mainland during the chinese civil war made their way to the walled city and became squatters occupying this parcel of land where china was technically still the sovereign power over the following decades the population of this 2.6-hectare 6.4-acre area dramatically increased reaching 33,000 by 1987 making the walled city the most densely populated area in the world at that time 95 96 despite widespread illegal activity and unsanitary living conditions the british largely took a hands-off approach with regard to the walled city due to the area s muddled territorial status and the likelihood of confrontation with the mainland authority 97 the joint declaration laid the groundwork for bilateral co-operation concerning any hong kong-related issues including the fate of the former military fort the chinese government acquiesced to the demolition of the settlement in 1987 98 the structure was cleared away in 1994 and the area converted into the kowloon walled city park 99 the signing of the joint declaration and impending retrocession of the colony to china triggered a wave of mass emigration residents during the transitional period were apprehensive about life after the transfer of sovereignty and feared an erosion of civil rights and individual liberties and the integrity of the legal system as well as an overall reduction in quality of life post-handover 100 although colonial residents were british subjects parliament denied hongkongers the right of abode in britain 101 102 emigrants left with the goal of obtaining residency or citizenship in western countries such as the united states canada and australia 103 104 over half a million people in total left the territory during the peak migration period from 1987 until 1996 105 in preparation for the transfer of sovereignty the colonial administration implemented a series of electoral reforms that gradually introduced elected seats to the then-fully appointed legislative council indirectly elected functional constituency seats were introduced in 1985 and directly elected geographical constituency seats in 1991 106 however following the tiananmen square protests of 1989 both the british and colonial governments were under intensified pressure to allow a faster pace of democratisation 107 the outflow of emigrants rapidly increased 108 from around 20,000 people per year throughout most of the 1980s to over 66,000 in 1992 105 governor chris patten proposed further reforms that broadly expanded the electorate to enable a fully elected legislature in 1995 109 the mainland authority considered these changes to be incompatible with the basic law and created a parallel provisional legislative council that would assume legislative powers after the transfer of sovereignty 109 transfer of sovereignty the hong kong convention and exhibition centre where the handover ceremony took place in 1997 on 1 july 1997 sovereignty over hong kong was officially transferred from the united kingdom to the people s republic of china marking the end of 156 years of british colonial rule as britain s last major and most populous remaining colony the handover effectively represented the end of the british empire exactly at midnight all government organisations with royal patronage simultaneously dropped the royal prefix from their titles and any regalia with references to the crown were replaced with insignia bearing the bauhinia 110 after the handover ceremony chris patten the last governor of hong kong together with prince charles departed the city on board the royal yacht britannia 111 tung chee-hwa was then sworn in as the first chief executive of hong kong with president jiang zemin administering the oath of office 112 the following morning the hong kong garrison of the people s liberation army entered the city and assumed control of the territory s military bases 112 special administrative region almost immediately after the transfer of sovereignty hong kong s economy was severely affected by the asian financial crisis and further depressed by the outbreak of the h5n1 strain of avian flu financial secretary donald tsang used the substantial territorial foreign currency reserves to maintain the hong kong dollar s currency peg and spent over hk 120 billion on significant holdings of major hong kong companies to prevent a general market collapse 67 while complete disaster was averted chief executive tung s housing policy of building 85,000 subsidised flats a year triggered a housing market crisis in 1998 depressing property prices and bankrupting some homeowners 113 hong kong was again gravely affected by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 114 115 in total 1,755 people were infected with 299 fatalities 116 economic activities slowed and schools were closed for weeks at the height of the epidemic an estimated hk 380 million us 48.9 million in contracts were lost as a result of the epidemic 117 while hong kong was also severely affected by the global recession of the late 2000s the tsang government introduced a series of economic stimulus measures that prevented a prolonged recession 118 hong kong island north coast overlooking victoria harbour and central and east kowloon from middle section of lugard road at daytime infrastructure post-handover has been rapidly developed with major transport links continuing to be planned and constructed the rose garden project to construct a new international airport begun under british administration was completed in 1998 operations began at the new site later that year the ngong ping cable car west kowloon cultural district multiple new railway lines and additional cross-harbour tunnels were all completed in the first 20 years of territorial self-governance direct infrastructure links with mainland china are also being actively developed with both the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge and hong kong section of the national high-speed railway currently under construction construction of the rail link generated a high level of controversy surrounding the demolition of key landmarks and displacement of residents along the planned route 119 political debates have centred themselves predominately on issues surrounding electoral reform and hong kong s jurisdictional independence from the central government following the handover democratic reform of the legislative council was immediately terminated and the government attempted to legislate sweeping national security legislation pursuant to article 23 of the basic law coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of chief executive tung s pro-beijing stance over 500,000 people demonstrated against the government which eventually led to tung s resignation in 2005 120 further proposals by the government to introduce a national education curriculum and nominee pre-screening before allowing chief executive elections triggered a number of mass protests in 2014 collectively known as the umbrella revolution 121 violent attacks on journalists an increasing level of press self-censorship alleged extraterritorial abduction of anti-china publishers 122 and covert intervention into hong kong s educational political and independent institutions have posed challenges to the policy of one country two systems in the 2016 legislative election there were reports of discrepancies in the electorate registry which contained ghost registrations across constituencies as well as political intervention to strip pro-independence individuals of their right to stand in elections 123 and alleged death threats to election candidates 124 social divisiveness on ethnic identity heightened markedly during leung s term especially among younger members of the population an ongoing university of hong kong study found that 69.7 of those aged 18 to 29 considered themselves as hongkongers while only 0.3 identified as chinese at the end of 2011 before the start of leung s tenure as chief executive ethnic identity polling for that demographic measured 42.4 and 11.8 respectively 125 126 government and politics carrie lam chief executive matthew cheung chief secretary hong kong is a special administrative region of china and maintains a separate legislature executive and judiciary from the rest of the country it has an executive-led parliamentary government modelled after the westminster system inherited from british colonial administration 127 128 the sino-british joint declaration guarantees the territory s capitalist economic system and autonomous government for 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty 129 under this framework and the concept of one country two systems the basic law of hong kong is the regional constitutional document establishing the structure and responsibility of the government 130 131 the chief executive is the head of government and is selected for a once-renewable five-year term by the election committee a 1,200-member nominating body composed of prominent corporate community and government leaders 132 the central government provides oversight for the regional government final interpretative power of the basic law rests with the standing committee of the national people s congress and the chief executive is formally appointed by the state council after nomination by the aforementioned election committee 130 responsibility for diplomatic and military affairs is also assumed by the central authority 129 government house official residence of the chief executive a chamber within the legislative council complex court of final appeal building in central formerly housed the supreme court and the legislative council before its current function the legislative council is a unicameral legislature with 70 members consisting of 35 directly elected members apportioned to geographical constituencies 30 members representing professional or special interest groups formed as functional constituencies and 5 members nominated by members of the district councils and selected in territory-wide elections 133 legislators are elected using multiple different voting systems determined by whichever constituency a particular seat is representing all directly elected seats are filled using proportional representation while functional constituencies other than the all-territory district council constituency choose their councillors using first-past-the-post or instant-runoff voting 134 government policy is determined by the executive council a body of advisors appointed by the chief executive with the authority to issue delegated legislation and proposes new bills to the legislature for debate and promulgation direct administration is managed by the civil service an apolitical bureaucracy intended to ensure positive implementation of policy 133 135 hong kong is represented in the national people s congress by 36 deputies chosen through an electoral college and 203 delegates in the chinese people s political consultative conference appointed by the central government 3 136 137 22 political parties had representatives elected to the legislative council in the 2016 election 138 these parties have aligned themselves into three ideological groups the pro-beijing camp who form the current government the pro-democracy camp and localist groups 139 the communist party does not have an official political presence in hong kong and its members do not run in local elections 140 the monetary authority is the currency board and de facto central bank of the territory 141 it is responsible for regulation of the hong kong dollar and along with hsbc standard chartered hong kong and the bank of china issues currency in the form of banknotes coinage is minted solely by the monetary authority 142 legal system and judiciary the judicial system is derived from the common law system of english law and was created at the establishment of the territory as a british colony chinese national law does not generally apply in the region and hong kong is treated as an independent jurisdiction 143 the court of final appeal is the territory s highest court exercising final adjudication over interpretation of laws and has the power to strike down statutes and legislation inconsistent with the basic law 144 145 it is led by the chief justice and consists of three additional permanent judges and one non-permanent seat filled on a rotating basis by both local judges and those invited from overseas common law jurisdictions 133 146 however authoritative interpretative power over the basic law itself instead lies with the standing committee of the national people s congress judges on all courts are appointed by the chief executive on the recommendation of an independent commission 133 147 as a common law jurisdiction hong kong courts may refer to precedents set in english law and commonwealth judicial rulings 133 146 the department of justice is responsible for handling legal matters on behalf of the government its responsibilities include providing legal advice criminal prosecution civil representation legal and policy drafting and reform and international judicial co-operation between different jurisdictions 143 apart from prosecuting criminal cases lawyers of the department of justice represent the government in any civil and administrative lawsuits against the administration 143 the department may call for judicial review of government action or legislation and may intervene in cases that may involve the greater public interest 148 the basic law protects the department of justice from interference by the government when exercising its control over criminal prosecution 133 149 law enforcement is a responsibility of the security bureau and its uniformed services which include the hong kong police customs and excise department and immigration department 150 greater china relations hong kong macau and mainland china each issue separate passports for their respective residents the three jurisdictions maintain distinct immigration policies 151 152 border controls are enforced for all travellers between these different parts of china 153 the constitutional and mainland affairs bureau is responsible for co-ordinating with the central government on issues related to the implementation and interpretation of the basic law electoral matters and bilateral economic and legal co-operative efforts 154 because national law does not automatically apply in the territory the two governments periodically negotiate formal agreements that cover a range of issues including cross-boundary trade law enforcement co-operation environmental protection shipping logistics among other fields 155 the liaison office is the mainland authority s corresponding representative and co-operative body in the region and maintains an extensive network of relations with local commercial educational and cultural organisations in addition to its government functions 156 the closer partnership economic arrangement formalised a policy of free trade between hong kong and the mainland with each government committing to reduce regulations concerning cross-boundary trade and investments 157 the agreement forms the basis for further integration between the two regions with supplements concerning more areas of co-operation added to the arrangement almost every year since its signing 157 a similar economic partnership arrangement with macau also details liberalisation of trade and deregulation of the movement of goods and services between the two special administrative regions 158 cross-strait relations with taiwan falls under the purview of the hong kong taiwan economic and cultural co-operation and promotion council 159 foreign relations scottish first minister nicola sturgeon meeting chief executive carrie lam responsibility for diplomatic affairs is assumed by the central government and the ministry of foreign affairs but hong kong retains the ability to enter into international agreements in commercial economic and other appropriate fields defined by the basic law 160 under the name hong kong china the territory co-operates with foreign nations in international organisations such as the world trade organization the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum and the international olympic committee although not a member of the united nations as the territory is not a sovereign nation hong kong actively participates in the organisation s agencies and is party to many of its international agreements 161 162 163 though no longer administering the territory after the transfer of sovereignty the united kingdom maintains strong ties with hong kong hundreds of british corporations maintain offices or their regional headquarters in the territory 164 and both governments collaborate on a number of economic and bilateral agreements 165 166 hong kong regularly invites british and commonwealth judges to sit on the court of final appeal 167 and its universities remain involved in the association of commonwealth universities 168 as a party to the sino-british joint declaration the united kingdom is obligated to ensure proper implementation of the treaty the foreign secretary gives biannual reports to parliament on the status of hong kong 169 there are 123 consular missions in hong kong maintained not only by other countries but major supranational organizations including the european union a number of consulates-general such as those of the united states and united kingdom operate independently of their corresponding embassies in beijing extend their areas of jurisdiction beyond hong kong to include macau are headed by officials with ambassadorial rank and report directly to their respective foreign offices 170 171 the regional government itself maintains trade offices for conducting external commercial relations throughout greater china and in foreign countries 172 regional and administrative divisions hong kong consists of three geographical regions divided by their historical time of acquisition by the united kingdom hong kong island kowloon and the new territories the city of victoria the first urban settlement in the territory was established on hong kong island and its area is analogous to present-day central and western district the territory is administratively divided into 18 districts each district is represented by a district council which advises the government on local issues such as the provisioning of public facilities maintenance of community programmes promotion of cultural activities and improvement of environmental policies 173 there are a total of 458 seats in the district councils 431 of which are directly elected while the remaining 27 are filled by ex officio members consisting of rural committee chairmen representing villages and towns of outlying areas of the new territories 173 the home affairs department communicates government policies and plans to the public through the district offices 174 local administration of municipal services was previously delegated to the urban council in kowloon and hong kong island and to the regional council in the new territories until they were abolished in 1999 175 electoral and political reforms presentation of an electoral reform consultation report in 2014 although the basic law lays the foundation for the regional government some of its articles require more specific legislation to be adopted before implementation article 23 provides for laws that prohibit treason and subversion in the territory and a bill was drafted pursuant to this constitutional requirement the government dropped this proposal after fierce opposition and protests against its perceived potential to restrict freedom of information 136 176 articles 45 and 68 state that the ultimate goal is for both the chief executive and all members of the legislative council to be selected by universal suffrage 160 while the legislature is now partially directly elected the executive continues to be selected by means other than direct election from its establishment as a colony hong kong has not had a fully representative democratic government colonial administration prior to the second world war largely excluded chinese representation 177 when hong kong was a british territory the executive was embodied by the sovereign who appointed and was personally represented by the governor the legislative council initially consisted exclusively of appointed white british members with its first chinese member not joining the chamber until 1880 72 after the end of japanese occupation and the resumption of british control amidst the greater movement of global decolonisation the government seriously considered constitutional reform in hong kong this was ultimately shelved due to fears of government infiltration by communist sympathisers after their victory at the conclusion of the chinese civil war 178 after negotiation of the sino-british joint declaration the legislative council was reformed from an assembly consisting solely of government officials and appointed members to include indirectly elected functional constituency seats in 1985 and directly elected seats in 1991 106 electoral reform introduced in 1994 greatly expanded the electorate for functional constituencies effectively making them representative 179 however the legislature was abolished after the handover and replaced with an interim provisional legislative council before new elections in 1998 were held under a selection system similar to what was used prior to the last colonial era reforms 180 181 electoral reform continues to be a contentious issue after the transfer of sovereignty the government faces ongoing calls to introduce direct election of the chief executive and all legislative council members 182 these efforts have been partially successful the election committee no longer selects a portion of the legislative council it was expanded from 800 to 1,200 members and ten new council seats were added for a total of 70 183 a central government decision in 2014 to require chief executive candidates to be pre-screened as part of a reform package to introduce universal suffrage incited large-scale protests demanding a more open process 184 the proposal was later rejected by the legislature and the executive selection process remains unchanged 185 sociopolitical issues and human rights protest in admiralty against an electoral reform proposal in 2014 the basic law establishes a series of fundamental rights for every resident of hong kong 186 though the regional government generally observes these guarantees the central government has been increasingly perceived to be encroaching on the autonomy of the territory 187 188 189 the standing committee of the national people s congress holds final interpretative power over the basic law and use of it can override any regional judicial process after the 2016 legislative elections six incoming legislative council members took their oaths of office improperly the standing committee subsequently issued a new interpretation of the basic law article regarding assumption of office preempting a territorial judicial review and allowing the high court to disqualify the legislators 190 191 judicial independence was also questioned after the disappearance of five staff members of a causeway bay bookstore that was known to sell literary material prohibited in the mainland 192 their possible abduction and rendition by chinese public security bureau officials would represent a breach of the sino-british joint declaration violating the guarantee of regional autonomy 193 mainland authorities do not have extraterritorial jurisdiction to enforce national laws 186 freedom of the press since the handover have been threatened by incidents of physical violence against journalists and as news media organisations are pressured to not publish stories that portray the central government in a negative way 194 195 news media has been increasingly prone to self-censorship as publication owners expand business interests on the mainland or media organisations become acquired by chinese corporations 196 197 the police have been accused of using excessive force against protesters at public rallies and overtly barring demonstrators from free assembly 198 199 ethnic minorities excluding those of european ancestry have marginal representation in government and are often discriminated against while seeking housing education and employment opportunities 200 201 while legislation prohibits discrimination based on age sex and disability it specifically excludes migrant workers along with immigrants and mainland chinese 202 203 employment vacancies and public service appointments frequently have language requirements which minority job seekers frequently fail to meet while language education resources remain inadequate for chinese learners 204 205 in recent years residents of a minority ethnicity have been more frequently placed on government advisory committees to address racial issues 206 foreign domestic helpers predominately women from the philippines and indonesia have little protection under territorial law although residing and working in hong kong workers of this class are not treated as ordinarily resident barring them from eligibility for right of abode 207 domestic helpers are required to live in the residence of the employer and must leave hong kong within two weeks on termination of an employment contract or face deportation 208 additionally the immigration department does not renew visas for workers who change employers more than three times in a single year 209 legislation offers nominal protection for migrant workers but the legal process for recourse is time-consuming and costly potentially taking 15 months for cases to be heard in the district court or labour tribunal 210 the culmulative effect of these policies and legislation leaves foreign domestic helpers vulnerable to exploitation and abuse by employers and greatly restricts their labour mobility 211 212 military a pla navy houjian-class missile boat patrolling hong kong waters the president of china holds the title of chairman of the central military commission making him supreme commander of the nation s armed forces 213 under the basic law responsibility for the defence of hong kong is assumed by the central government 136 the hong kong garrison with 6,000 active duty servicemen of the people s liberation army is stationed in the territory and headquartered at the chinese people s liberation army forces hong kong building in central 214 the basic law also protects civilians and civil affairs against interference by the garrison military personnel are subject to both national and hong kong laws while serving in the territory 215 under exceptional circumstances the regional government may ask the central government for assistance from the garrison in disaster relief 136 residents of hong kong are not required to perform military service current law has no provision for enlistment of local residents meaning that the military force defending the territory is composed entirely of non-hongkonger personnel 216 as responsibility for the defence of hong kong rests solely with the central authority the regional government is not obligated to bear the expenditures of the garrison stationed in the city 136 during the colonial era territorial defence was the responsibility of the british forces overseas hong kong supplemented by local militia organized as the royal hong kong regiment 217 the only military-affiliated organisation that recruits local residents is the hong kong army cadets association a uniformed youth organisation of children aged 6 and older sponsored by the people s liberation army 218 geography areas of urban development and vegetation are visible in this false-colour satellite image hong kong is located on china s south coast 60 km 37 mi east of macau on the opposite side

scattered settlements throughout the new territories 225 the highest elevation in the territory is at tai mo shan 957 metres 3,140 ft above sea level 226 hong kong s long and irregular coast provides it with many bays rivers and beaches 227 in 2011 unesco listed the hong kong global geopark as part of its global geoparks network hong kong geopark is made up of eight geo-areas distributed across the sai kung volcanic rock region and northeast new territories sedimentary rock region 228 despite hong kong s intense urbanisation it has tried to promote a green environment 229 and recent growing public concern has prompted the severe restriction of further land reclamation from victoria harbour 230 environmental awareness is growing as hong kong suffers from increasing pollution compounded by its geography and tall buildings approximately 80 of the city s smog originates from other parts of the pearl river delta 231 climate in the k ppen geiger classification system hong kong has a humid

the high density and tall skyline of hong kong s urban area is due to a lack of available sprawl space with the average distance from the harbourfront to the steep hills of hong kong island at 1.3 km 0.81 mi 242 much of it reclaimed land this lack of space causes demand for dense high-rise offices and housing thirty-six of the world s 100 tallest residential buildings are in hong kong 243 more people in hong kong live or work above the 14th floor than anywhere else on earth making it the world s most vertical city 244 245 as a result of the lack of space and demand for construction few older buildings remain and the city is becoming a centre for modern architecture 246 247 the international commerce centre icc at 484 m 1,588 ft high is the tallest building in hong kong and the seventh tallest in the world by height to roof measurement 248 the previous record holder was tower 2 of the international finance centre at 415 m 1,362 ft high 249 other recognisable skyline features

600,000 in 1945 264 6 since 1979 267 the fertility rate has consistently declined below the replacement level of 2.1 reaching 1.2 children per woman in 2016 268 continued growth can be attributed to high rates of immigration from foreign countries and greater china 40 of the population were born outside of the territory 269 the overwhelming majority 92 of the population is han chinese 2 the majority of whom are taishanese teochew hakka and a variety of other cantonese peoples a large portion of hong kong s majority population originated from the neighbouring province of guangdong 264

rights may be acquired through marriage e g the right to work but these do not include the right to vote or stand for office 279 the influx of chinese immigrants is a significant contributor to

official presence in the government only anglican and catholic bishops were placed in the colonial order of precedence 297 other religions with significant numbers of adherents are now similarly acknowledged by the post-handover government 298 among the religious population the traditional three teachings of china buddhism confucianism and taoism have the most adherents estimated to be around 1.5 million 299 about 869,000 residents profess christianity as their faith forming 11.7 of the total population 299 protestants and catholics make up the bulk of this number while the remainder is composed of members of other denominations including mormons 300 jehovah s witnesses 301 and eastern orthodox christians 299 islam has about 300,000 adherents in the territory 50,000 of whom are chinese 299 followers of other religions including sikhism hinduism judaism and the bah faith generally ethnically originate from the same region as their faith 299 regulation and restrictions on religion in mainland china do not apply in hong kong the anglican and catholic churches freely appoint their own bishops and maintain ties with the church of england and the vatican although banned by the central government the practice of falun gong is tolerated in the territory 302 economy economic indicators nominal gdp us 334 billion 2017 7 real gdp growth 3.9 2016 303 cpi inflation 2.4

2017 307 hong kong has a capitalist mixed service economy characterised by low taxation minimal government market intervention and an established international financial market 308 it is the 35th-largest economy in the world with a nominal gdp of approximately us 334 billion 7 hong kong s economy has consistently ranked at the top of the heritage foundation s index of economic freedom since 1995 309 310 311 and had been described by milton friedman as the world s greatest experiment in laissez-faire capitalism 312 but the territory suffers from a relatively high level of income disparity 8 92 the hong kong stock exchange is the seventh largest in the world and has a market capitalisation of us 4.3 trillion as of december 2017 313 the city is an important centre for international finance and trade with one of the greatest concentrations of corporate headquarters in the asia-pacific region 314 hong kong is the world s seventh largest trading entity in both exports and imports with the total value of traded goods exceeding its gross domestic product 20 21 it is also the world s largest transshipment centre 315 much of its exports consist of re-exports 316 products manufactured outside of the territory especially in mainland china and distributed via hong kong its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world s second busiest container port and the world s busiest airport for international cargo the territory s largest export markets are mainland china and the united states 4 the port of hong kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world the territory has little arable land and few natural resources so it imports most of its food and raw materials imports account for more than 90 per cent of hong kong s food supply including nearly all of the meat and rice available there 317 agricultural activity relatively unimportant to hong kong s economy and contributing just 0.1 of gdp primarily consists of growing premium food and flower varieties 318 while the territory boasted one of the largest manufacturing economies in asia during the latter half of the colonial era as the city industrialised hong kong s economy is now dominated by the services sector services alone constitute 92.7 per cent of economic output with the public sector accounting for about 10 per cent 319 as one of the four asian tigers hong kong rapidly industrialised as a manufacturing centre driven by exports through the post-war decades of the 20th century turning the territory into a developed high-income area by the end of the colonial era 320 between 1961 and 1997 hong kong s gross domestic product multiplied by a factor of 180 while per-capita gdp increased 87 times over 321 322 323 the territory s gdp relative to mainland china s peaked at 27 per cent in 1993 but this has since fallen significantly as the mainland developed and liberalised its economy declining to less than 3 per cent in 2017 324 the government traditionally played a passive role in the economy with little by way of industrial policy and almost no import or export controls under the official policy of positive non-interventionism hong kong was often cited as a comprehensive example of laissez-faire capitalism 320 while the economy transitioned to become service-based in the 1980s 320 late colonial governments steadily introduced interventionist policies that were continued and expanded by post-handover administrations including export credit guarantees a compulsory pension scheme a minimum wage anti-discrimination laws and a state mortgage backer 312 trading floor of the hong kong stock exchange hong kong s economic and infrastructure integration with china has increased significantly from the start of market liberalisation in the mainland beginning in 1978 since resumption of cross-boundary train service in 1979 multiple rail and road links have been continuously improved and constructed facilitating trade between the regions 325 326 the closer partnership economic arrangement formalised a policy of free trade between hong kong and the mainland with each jurisdiction pledging to eliminate remaining obstacles to the trade of goods and services and cross-boundary investments 327 chinese companies have greatly expanded their economic presence in the territory since the transfer of sovereignty mainland firms now represent over half of the total value of the hang seng index up from just 5 per cent in 1997 328 329 the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the united states dollar since 1983 because most business transactions in the territory are done in us dollars the fixed exchange-rate system is intended to reduce foreign exchange risk for international traders and investors 330 policy changes implemented by the federal reserve affect hong kong but do not necessarily take the territory into account and volatility in the value of the us dollar itself requires the monetary authority to continually maintain the fixed exchange rate at substantial cost 331 consequently there are periodic appeals to discontinue the existing currency peg and to either allow the hong kong dollar to be freely floated or peg it to the chinese renminbi 332 333 tourism forms a major part of the territorial economy accounting for 5 of gdp 334 26.6 million visitors contributed us 32.9 billion in international tourism receipts in 2016 making hong kong the 14th most popular destination for international tourists it is also the most popular city for tourists receiving over 70 per cent more visitors than its closest competitor macau 335 the city is further consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities for expatriates 336 337 infrastructure energy lamma power station the oldest operating generating plant in the territory hong kong imports most of its generated electricity and fuel 338 1 the vast majority of this energy comes from fossil fuels with 46 from coal and 47 from petroleum 338 9 the remainder is from other imports including nuclear energy generated on the mainland 338 29 renewable sources accounts for a negligible amount of total energy generated for the territory 338 6 wind power sources have only been developed at a very small scale 338 1 while solar panels are deployed on a limited scale for use in private homes 339 water and sanitation with few natural lakes and rivers a high population density groundwater sources inaccessible through hard granite bedrock and extremely seasonal variations in rainfall the territory does not have an adequately reliable local source of fresh water thus the dongjiang river in neighbouring guangdong supplies 70 of the city s water use of seawater for toilet flushing supplied through a separate distribution system greatly reduces strain on freshwater supply 340 a planned desalination plant in tseung kwan o is expected to reduce dependence on imports and provide a more reliable water source during periods of low rainfall and severe droughts 341 telecommunications mobile phone usage in hong kong is ubiquitous 342 9 there are more than 17 million active mobile phone subscribers 343 246 more than double the total number of residents in the territory 6 internet usage is similarly high with 5.58 million users or 87.5 of the population 342 10 the regional average broadband connection speed is 21.9 mbit s making hong kong fourth in the world in terms of internet speed 344 broadband internet access is available to 92.4 of households connections over fibre-optic infrastructure are increasingly prevalent 345 there are 29 submarine communications cables linking hong kong s telecommunications network with the rest of the world 346 transport

kong has a highly developed and sophisticated transport network encompassing both public and private modes of travel regulation and administrative policy is handled by the transport department over 90 of daily journeys are made on public transport the highest such percentage in the world 28 the octopus card a contactless smart payment card is widely accepted on railways buses and ferries and can be used for payment in most retail stores 347 348 launched in 1997 on the mass transit railway it is the second contactless smart card system in the world to be used and is a ubiquitous form of payment throughout the territory rail the mass transit railway mtr is an extensive passenger railway network connecting 93 metro stations throughout the territory 349 with a daily ridership of over five million the system serves 41 of all public transit passengers in the city 350 service is extremely punctual achieving an on-time rate of 99.9 351 the rapid transit network operates within inner urban hong kong and extends to new kowloon lantau island and the northeastern and northwestern parts of the new territories nine railway lines provide general metro services while the airport express provides a direct link from hong kong international airport to the city centre and a dedicated line transports passengers to and from hong kong disneyland cross-boundary train service to shenzhen is offered by the east rail line terminating at immigration checkpoints at lo wu and lok ma chau inter-city trains to guangzhou shanghai and beijing are operated from hung hom station 352 connecting service to the national high-speed rail system is scheduled to begin in 2018 after construction of west kowloon station completes 353 roads and taxis entrance to the cross-harbour tunnel in hung hom kowloon red taxis outside the international commerce centre in kowloon road traffic in the territory drives on the left unlike that of mainland china highways are organised as the hong kong strategic route and exit number system a system of major roads comprising three north-south routes five east-west routes and the new territories circular road all major geographic areas of the territory are connected over this road system route 8 runs along the tsing ma bridge to connect the city centre with tsing yi and lantau island and routes 1 2 and 3 pass through the three tunnels under victoria

expressway system at lok ma chau the g4 beijing hong kong macau expressway ends at the huanggang port and is connected to route 9 by a short spur road beginning at immediately at the territorial border when completed the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge will provide an additional connection to the mainland road system and create a direct route to the western side of the pearl river estuary 326 while public transport systems handle the majority of passenger traffic there are over 500,000 private vehicles licensed in hong kong 354 because of the territory s small size residents are discouraged from private car ownership cars are subjected to a first-time registration tax which varies from 35 to over 100 depending on the size and value of the car and over half the cost of petrol sold at filling stations is due to taxes 355 356 357 road traffic is extremely congested during peak hours with average vehicle speeds reaching as a low as 10 km h 6.2 mph on major roads 358 congestion is exacerbated by the urban layout of the city the physical constraints to expanding road transport infrastructure and a growing number of vehicles 359 more than 18,000 taxicabs easily identifiable by their bright paint are licensed to carry riders in the territory 360 colour codes signify service areas red taxis serve hong kong island kowloon all of the new territories and the northern part of lantau island green taxis operate in portions of the new territories and specific stations outside of their assigned area blue taxis are available only on lantau island 361 aviation

most air cargo traffic in the world 363 with over 70 million passengers annually it is the eighth busiest airport worldwide by passenger traffic 364 hkg is constructed on an artificial island north of lantau island and was built to replace the overcrowded kai tak airport in kowloon bay 365 ferries the star ferry in service since 1888 operates two lines across victoria harbour providing scenic views

kowloon ferry and tsui wah ferry they also operate routes to macau and nearby cities in mainland china including direct service between hong kong international airport and shenzhen bao an international airport for transiting passengers 367 cross-boundary services operate out of the macau ferry terminal china ferry terminal and tuen mun ferry pier 368 hong kong is famous for its junk ships that traverse the harbour and small kai-to ferries that serve remote coastal settlements 369 370 buses and trams public bus services are franchised and run by five private companies together operating more than 700 routes across the territory the largest are kowloon motor bus providing 402 routes in kowloon and new territories citybus operating 154 routes on hong kong island and new world first bus running an additional 56 routes in kowloon and hong kong island all three major bus operators provide cross-harbour services serving as a major transport link for the 3.9 million daily bus passengers 350 double-decker buses were introduced to hong kong in 1949 and are now almost exclusively used single-decker buses remain in use for routes with lower demand or roads with lower load capacity public light buses serve most parts of hong kong particularly areas where standard bus lines cannot reach or do not reach as frequently quickly or directly 371 hong kong island s steep hilly terrain was initially served by sedan chairs 372 the peak tram the first public transport system in hong kong has provided vertical rail transport between central and victoria peak since 1888 373 in the central and western district there is an extensive system of escalators and moving pavements including the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world the mid-levels escalator 374 hong kong tramways which has served the territory since 1904 covers the northern parts of hong kong island 375 the mtr operates the light rail system serving the districts of tuen mun and yuen long 376 education main building of the university of hong kong in 1912 shortly after the campus opened to students education in hong kong is largely modelled after that of the united kingdom particularly the english system 377 children are required to attend school from the age of six until completion of secondary education generally at age 18 378 379 mandatory education has contributed to an adult literacy rate of 95.7 380 at the end of secondary schooling a public examination is administered to all students awarding the hong kong diploma of secondary education on successful completion 381 of residents aged 15 and older 81.3 completed lower secondary schooling 66.4 graduated from upper secondary 31.6 attended a non-degree tertiary program and 24 earned a bachelor s degree or higher 294 66 comprehensive schools fall under three categories public schools which are fully government-run subsidised schools including government aid-and-grant schools and private schools often those run by religious organisations and that base admissions on academic merit these schools are subject to the curriculum guidelines as provided by the education bureau private schools subsidised under the direct subsidy scheme and international schools fall outside of this system and may elect to use differing curricula and teach based on other languages 379 old campus of st paul s college the first school established in the colonial era the government maintains a policy of mother tongue instruction in which the medium of instruction is cantonese 382 with written education in both chinese and english in secondary schools biliterate and trilingual proficiency is emphasised which has encouraged the proliferation of spoken mandarin language education 383 the programme for international student assessment ranked hong kong s education system as the second best in the world 384 hong kong has ten universities within its territory the university of hong kong was founded as the city s first institute of higher education during the early colonial period in 1911 385 the chinese university of hong kong was established in 1963 to fill the need for a university that taught using chinese as its primary language of instruction 386 along with the hong kong university of science and technology and city university of hong kong these universities are ranked among the best in asia 387 in subsequent years the hong kong polytechnic university hong kong baptist university lingnan university education university of hong kong open university of hong kong and hong kong shue yan university were established to meet growing demand for higher education competition among students for admission into undergraduate programmes is fierce as the number of available placements remains limited the city additionally has post-secondary institutes that provide an alternative path for tertiary education 388 389 health queen elizabeth hospital once the largest hospital in the commonwealth of nations was opened in 1963 healthcare in hong kong is mainly provided by the hospital authority a government agency that administers the 42 public medical facilities in the territory 390 treatment in the universal public system is highly subsidised and available to all residents permanent and non-permanent who have an identity card 391 while the statutory system fulfills the vast majority of medical service needs private healthcare facilities provide more readily accessible and specialised care at higher cost especially for individuals with non-resident status 391 healthcare policy and provisioning is set by the department of health which also directly supervises the 12 registered private hospital facilities 392 life expectancy in hong kong is 81.3 years for males and 87.3 years for females as of 2016 making it the highest in the world 4 393 the region also has one of the lowest infant mortality rates at 1.5 per 1,000 births 394 infants are generally well immunised against communicable diseases 395 cancer pneumonia heart disease cerebrovascular disease and severe injuries caused by accidents are the five leading causes of death in the territory 395 obesity rates have increased sharply in the last decade approximately 30 of the population is obese and an additional 20 is overweight 396 adolescent pregnancy rates are comparatively lower than many developed nations 397 official abortion rates are similarly low but it is estimated that the number of people who seek termination is higher due to procedural barriers and costs 398 399 400 the territorial healthcare system is separate from those serving mainland china and macau individuals from those regions seeking medical services in hong kong are not entitled to publicly subsidised care intended for local residents 401 with the reverse being true as well 402 403 stricter medical procedure standards lower mortality rates and the prospect of permanent residency have led expectant mothers from the mainland to travel to the city to give birth straining capacity of local maternity wards 404 405 macanese residents also often seek regular care in hong kong due to a lack of developed healthcare infrastructure in macau s physically limited area 401 culture a statue of bruce lee on the avenue of stars a tribute to the city s martial arts hong kong is frequently described as a place where east meets west reflecting the cultural mix of the territory s chinese roots with western influence from its time as a british colony 406 though the vast majority of the population is ethnically chinese the long period of colonial administration and sustained exposure to western culture has resulted in a distinct cultural identity from that of mainland china 407 mainstream culture in hong kong is an eastern culture largely derived from immigrants originating from various parts of china but influenced by british-style education a separate political system and the territory s status as a major port of trade 407 408 chinese immigrants after the second world war fueled hong kong s economic growth in the post-war decades creating the perception that residents enjoy high social mobility and a culture characterised by individual entrepreneurialism and a strong work ethic among those who arrived 409 410 as most incoming migrants from the mainland were fleeing economic hardship people in hong kong today tend to tie self-image and decision-making to material benefits quite closely 409 411 412 concepts like feng shui are taken very seriously with expensive construction projects often hiring expert consultants and are often believed to make or break a business 413 other objects like ba gua mirrors are still regularly used to deflect evil spirits 414 and buildings often lack any floor number that has a 4 in it 415 due to its similarity to the word for die in cantonese 416 the fusion of east and west also characterises hong kong s cuisine where dim sum hot pot and fast food restaurants coexist with haute cuisine 417 hong kong is a recognized global centre of trade and calls itself an entertainment hub 418 its martial arts film genre gained a high level of popularity in the late 1960s and 1970s several hollywood performers notable actors and martial artists began their careers in hong kong cinema notably bruce lee jackie chan chow yun-fat michelle yeoh maggie cheung and jet li a number of hong kong film-makers have succeeded in hollywood such as john woo wong kar-wai and stephen chow 418 homegrown films such as chungking express infernal affairs shaolin soccer rumble in the bronx in the mood for love and echoes of the rainbow have gained international recognition hong kong is the centre for cantopop music which draws its influence from other forms of chinese music and western genres and has a multinational fanbase 419 the hong kong government supports cultural institutions such as the hong kong heritage museum the hong kong museum of art the hong kong academy for performing arts and the hong kong philharmonic orchestra the government s leisure and cultural services department subsidises and sponsors international performers brought to hong kong many international cultural activities are organised by the government consulates and privately 420 421 sport and recreation the hong kong sevens is considered the premier tournament on the irb

asian cup and the 1995 dynasty cup 424 425 competitive dragon boat racing originated in hong kong due to british colonial influence hong kong had an earlier introduction to western athletics compared to other east asian regions 426 as part of the government s active involvement in promoting sports participation the tourism board organised the first international dragon boat racing competition in 1976 427 428 hong kong maintains territory-wide teams for participation in all international sporting events and represents itself separately instead of as a part of chinese national teams the city has sent athletes to almost every summer olympics since 1952 as of 2017 hong kong has won 3 medals at the olympic games 126 at the paralympic games and 17 at the commonwealth games no longer part of the commonwealth of nations the city s last appearance at the commonwealth games was in 1994 429 media tvb city headquarters of the first wireless television station in the territory the largest and

circulation are the headline daily and oriental daily news the most widely circulating english-language counterparts are the south china morning post which is the publication of record for the territory and the standard the media in hong kong is relatively free from official interference compared to mainland china although the far eastern economic review pointed to signs of self-censorship by media whose owners have close ties to or business interests in the people s republic of china and states that even western media outlets are not immune to growing chinese economic power 433 notable
