https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet) theia planet from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search theia i is a hypothesized ancient planetary-mass object in the early solar system that according to the giant impact hypothesis collided with another planetary-mass object gaia the early earth around 4.5 billion years ago 1 2 according to the hypothesis theia was an earth trojan about the size of mars with diameter of about 6,000 km 3,700 miles geologist edward young of the university of california los angeles drawing on an analysis of rocks collected by apollo missions 12 15 and 17 proposes that theia collided head-on with earth 3 in contrast to the previous theory that suggested a glancing impact models of the impact indicate that theia s debris gathered around earth to form the early moon some scientists think the material thrown into orbit originally formed two moons 4 5 that later merged to form the single moon we know today the theia hypothesis also explains why earth s core is larger than would be expected for a body its size according to the hypothesis theia s core and mantle mixed with earth s 6 contents 1 orbit 2 name 3 collision 4 hypothesis 5 see also 6 references orbit edit theia is thought to have orbited in the l4 or l5 configuration presented by the earth sun system where it would tend to remain in that case it would have grown potentially to a size comparable to mars gravitational perturbations by venus could have eventually put it onto a collision course with the earth 7 name edit theia was named for the titaness theia who in greek mythology was the mother of selene the goddess of the moon 8 that echoes the planet theia s collision with the early earth theorized to have created the moon citation needed an alternative name orpheus is also used 9 collision edit animation of collision event between earth and theia according to the giant-impact hypothesis theia orbited the sun nearly along the orbit of the proto-earth by staying close to one or the other of the sun earth system s two more stable lagrangian points i e either l4 or l5 citation needed theia was eventually perturbed away from that relationship by the gravitational influence of jupiter and or venus resulting in a collision between theia and earth citation needed originally the hypothesis supposed that theia had struck earth with a glancing blow 10 and ejected many pieces of both the proto-earth and theia those pieces either forming one body that became the moon or forming two moons that eventually merged to form the moon 4 such accounts assumed that theia striking the proto-earth head-on would have led to the destruction of both planets creating a short-lived second asteroid belt between the orbits of venus and mars in contrast evidence published in january 2016 suggests that the impact was indeed a head-on collision and that theia s remains can be found both in the earth and the moon 11 hypothesis edit from the beginning of modern astronomy there have been at least four hypotheses for the origin of the moon that a single body split into earth and the moon that the moon was captured by earth s gravity as most of the outer planets smaller moons were captured that earth and the moon formed at the same time when the protoplanetary disk accreted and the theia scenario the lunar rock samples retrieved by apollo astronauts were found to be very similar in composition to earth s crust and so were likely removed from earth in some violent event 3 12 13 see also edit disrupted planet nibiru babylonian astronomy
