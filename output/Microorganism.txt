https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism microorganism from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a cluster of escherichia coli bacteria magnified 10,000 times a microorganism or microbe a is a microscopic organism which may exist in its single-celled form or in a colony of cells the possible existence of unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times such as in jain scriptures from 6th-century-bc india and the 1st-century-bc book on agriculture by marcus terentius varro microbiology the scientific study of microorganisms began with their observation under the microscope in the 1670s by antonie van leeuwenhoek in the 1850s louis pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage debunking the theory of spontaneous generation in the 1880s robert koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases tuberculosis cholera and anthrax microorganisms include all unicellular organisms and so are extremely diverse of the three domains of life identified by carl woese all of the archaea and bacteria are microorganisms these were previously grouped together in the two domain system as prokaryotes the other being the eukaryotes the third domain eukaryota includes all multicellular organisms and many unicellular protists and protozoans some protists are related to animals and some to green plants many of the multicellular organisms are microscopic namely micro-animals some fungi and some algae but these are not discussed here they live in almost every habitat from the poles to the equator deserts geysers rocks and the deep sea some are adapted to extremes such as very hot or very cold conditions others to high pressure and a few such as deinococcus radiodurans to high radiation environments microorganisms also make up the microbiota found in and on all multicellular organisms a december 2017 report stated that 3.45 billion year old australian rocks once contained microorganisms the earliest direct evidence of life on earth 1 2 microbes are important in human culture and health in many ways serving to ferment foods treat sewage produce fuel enzymes and other bioactive compounds they are essential tools in biology as model organisms and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism they are a vital component of fertile soils in the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora they are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases and as such are the target of hygiene measures contents 1 discovery 1.1 ancient precursors 1.2 early modern 1.3

references 9 external links discovery edit antonie van leeuwenhoek was the first to study microorganisms using simple microscopes of his own design lazzaro spallanzani showed that boiling a broth stopped it from decaying ancient precursors edit the possible existence of microorganisms was discussed for many centuries before their discovery in the 17th century the existence of unseen microbial life was postulated by jainism in the 6th century bc mahavira asserted the existence of unseen microbiological creatures living in earth water air and fire 3 the jain scriptures also describe nigodas as sub-microscopic creatures living in large clusters and having a very short life which were said to pervade every part of the universe even the tissues of plants and animals 4 the earliest known idea to indicate the possibility of diseases spreading by yet unseen organisms was that of the roman scholar marcus terentius varro in a 1st-century bc book titled on agriculture in which he called the unseen creatures animalcules and warns against locating a homestead near a swamp 5 and because there are bred certain minute creatures that cannot be seen by the eyes which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and they cause serious diseases 5 in the canon of medicine 1020 avicenna suggested that tuberculosis and other diseases might be contagious 6 7 early modern edit akshamsaddin turkish scientist mentioned the microbe in his work maddat ul-hayat the material of life about two centuries prior to antonie van leeuwenhoek s discovery through experimentation it is incorrect to assume that diseases appear one by one in humans disease infects by spreading from one person to another this infection occurs through seeds that are so small they cannot be seen but are alive 8 9 in 1546 girolamo fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact or even without contact over long distances 10 antonie van leeuwenhoek is considered to be the father of microbiology he was the first in 1673 to discover observe describe study and conduct scientific experiments with microoorganisms using simple single-lensed microscopes of his own design 11 12 13 14 robert hooke a contemporary of leeuwenhoek also used microscopy to observe microbial life in the form of the fruiting bodies of moulds in his 1665 book micrographia he made drawings of studies and he coined the term cell 15 19th century edit louis pasteur showed that spallanzani s findings held even if air could enter through a filter that kept particles out robert koch showed that microorganisms caused disease louis pasteur 1822 1895 exposed boiled broths to the air in vessels that contained a filter to prevent particles from passing through to the growth medium and also in vessels without a filter but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not come in contact with the broth by boiling the broth beforehand pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths at the beginning of his experiment nothing grew in the broths in the course of pasteur s experiment this meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside as spores on dust rather than spontaneously generated within the broth thus pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease 16 in 1876 robert koch 1843 1910 established that microorganisms can cause disease he found that the blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of bacillus anthracis koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking a small sample of blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one and this caused the healthy animal to become sick he also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth then inject it into a healthy animal and cause illness based on these experiments he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as koch s postulates 17 although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today 18 the discovery of microorganisms such as euglena that did not fit into either the animal or plant kingdoms since they were photosynthetic like plants but motile like animals led to the naming of a third kingdom in the 1860s in 1860 john hogg called this the protoctista and in 1866 ernst haeckel named it the protista 19 20 21 the work of pasteur and koch did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance it was not until the work of martinus beijerinck and sergei winogradsky late in the 19th century that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed 22 beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques 23 while his work on the tobacco mosaic virus established the basic principles of virology it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation of a wide range of microbes with wildly different physiologies winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes 24 he was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria 22 french-canadian microbiologist felix d herelle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists 25 classification and structure edit microorganisms can be found almost anywhere on earth bacteria and archaea are almost always microscopic while a number of eukaryotes are also microscopic including most protists some fungi as well as some micro-animals and plants viruses are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered as microorganisms although a subfield of microbiology is virology the study of viruses 26 27 28 evolution edit carl woese s 1990 phylogenetic tree based on rrna data shows the domains of bacteria archaea and eukaryota all are microorganisms except some eukaryote groups single-celled microorganisms were the first forms of life to develop on earth approximately 3 4 billion years ago 29 30 31 further evolution was slow 32 and for about 3 billion years in the precambrian eon much of the history of life on earth all organisms were microorganisms 33 34 bacteria algae and fungi have been identified in amber that is 220 million years old which shows that the morphology of microorganisms has changed little since the triassic period 35 the newly discovered biological role played by nickel however especially that brought about by volcanic eruptions from the siberian traps may have accelerated the evolution of methanogens towards the end of the permian triassic extinction event 36 microorganisms tend to have a relatively fast rate of evolution most microorganisms can reproduce rapidly and bacteria are also able to freely exchange genes through conjugation transformation and transduction even between widely divergent species 37 this horizontal gene transfer coupled with a high mutation rate and other means of transformation allows microorganisms to swiftly evolve via natural selection to survive in new environments and respond to environmental stresses this rapid evolution is important in medicine as it has led to the development of multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics 38 a possible transitional form of microorganism between a prokaryote and a eukaryote was discovered in 2012 by japanese scientists parakaryon myojinensis is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote and the presence of endosymbionts this is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote 39 40 archaea edit archaea are prokaryotic unicellular organisms and form the first domain of life in carl woese s three-domain system a prokaryote is defined as having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria with which they were once grouped in 1990 the microbiologist woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria archaea and eukaryotes 41 and thereby split the prokaryote domain archaea differ from bacteria in both their genetics and biochemistry for example while bacterial cell membranes are made from phosphoglycerides with ester bonds archaean membranes are made of ether lipids 42 archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments such as hot springs but have since been found in all types of habitats 43 only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment with crenarchaeota being the most common form of life in the ocean dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth 44 45 these organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation 46 the combined domains of archaea and bacteria make up the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on earth and inhabit practically all environments where the temperature is below 140 c they are found in water soil air as the microbiome of an organism hot springs and even deep beneath the earth s crust in rocks 47 the number of prokaryotes is estimated to be around five million trillion trillion or 5 1030 accounting for at least half the biomass on earth 48 the biodiversity of the prokaryotes is unknown but may be very large a may 2016 estimate based on laws of scaling from known numbers of species against the size of organism gives an estimate of perhaps 1 trillion species on the planet of which most would be microorganisms currently only one-thousandth of one percent of that total have been described 49 bacteria edit staphylococcus aureus bacteria magnified about 10,000x bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic unicellular and having no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle bacteria are microscopic with a few extremely rare exceptions such as thiomargarita namibiensis 50 bacteria function and reproduce as individual cells but they can often aggregate in multicellular colonies 51 some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures operating as multicellular groups as part of their life cycle 52 or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as e coli their genome is usually a circular bacterial chromosome a single loop of dna although they can also harbor small pieces of dna called plasmids these plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation bacteria have an enclosing cell wall which provides strength and rigidity to their cells they reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction however many bacterial species can transfer dna between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation 53 some species form extraordinarily resilient spores but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival not reproduction under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and their numbers can double as quickly as every 20 minutes 54 eukaryotes edit most living things that are visible to the naked eye in their adult form are eukaryotes including humans however a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms unlike bacteria and archaea eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus the golgi apparatus and mitochondria in their cells the nucleus is an organelle that houses the dna that makes up a cell s genome dna deoxyribonucleic acid itself is arranged in complex chromosomes 55 mitochondria are organelles vital in metabolism as they are the site of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation they evolved from symbiotic bacteria and retain a remnant genome 56 like bacteria plant cells have cell walls and contain organelles such as chloroplasts in addition to the organelles in other eukaryotes chloroplasts produce energy from light by photosynthesis and were also originally symbiotic bacteria 56 unicellular eukaryotes consist of a single cell throughout their life cycle this qualification is significant since most multicellular eukaryotes consist of a single cell called a zygote only at the beginning of their life cycles microbial eukaryotes can be either haploid or diploid and some organisms have multiple cell nuclei 57 unicellular eukaryotes usually reproduce asexually by mitosis under favorable conditions however under stressful conditions such as nutrient limitations and other conditions associated with dna damage they tend to reproduce sexually by meiosis and syngamy 58 protists edit euglena mutabilis a photosynthetic flagellate of eukaryotic groups the protists are most commonly unicellular and microscopic this is a highly diverse group of organisms that are not easy to classify 59 60 several algae species are multicellular protists and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular colonial and multicellular forms 61 the number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified protist diversity is high in oceans deep sea-vents river sediment and an acidic river suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may yet be discovered 62 63 fungi edit the fungi have several unicellular species such as baker s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe some fungi such as the pathogenic yeast candida albicans can undergo phenotypic switching and grow as single cells in some environments and filamentous hyphae in others 64 plants edit the green algae are a large group of photosynthetic eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms although some green algae are classified as protists others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants which are the most familiar group of land plants algae can grow as single cells or in long chains of cells the green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates usually but not always with two flagella per cell as well as various colonial coccoid and filamentous forms in the charales which are the algae most closely related to higher plants cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism there are about 6000 species of green algae 65 ecology edit microorganisms are found in almost every habitat present in nature including hostile environments such as the north and south poles deserts geysers and rocks they also include all the marine microorganisms of the oceans and deep sea some types of microorganisms have adapted to extreme environments and sustained colonies these organisms are known as extremophiles extremophiles have been isolated from rocks as much as 7 kilometres below the earth s surface 66 and it has been suggested that the amount of organisms living below the earth s surface is comparable with the amount of life on or above the surface 47 extremophiles have been known to survive for a prolonged time in a vacuum and can be highly resistant to radiation which may even allow them to survive in space 67 many types of microorganisms have intimate symbiotic relationships with other larger organisms some of which are mutually beneficial mutualism while others can be damaging to the host organism parasitism if microorganisms can cause disease in a host they are known as pathogens and then they are sometimes referred to as microbes microorganisms play critical roles in earth s biogeochemical cycles as they are responsible for decomposition and nitrogen fixation 68 bacteria use regulatory networks that allow them to adapt to almost every environmental niche on earth 69 70 a network of interactions among diverse types of molecules including dna rna proteins and metabolites is utilised by the bacteria to achieve regulation of gene expression in bacteria the principal function of regulatory networks is to control the response to environmental changes for example nutritional status and environmental stress 71 a complex organization of networks permits the microorganism to coordinate and integrate multiple environmental signals 69 extremophiles edit a tetrad of deinococcus radiodurans a radioresistant extremophile bacterium extremophiles are microorganisms that have adapted so that they can survive and even thrive in extreme environments that are normally fatal to most life-forms thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive in high temperatures psychrophiles thrive in extremely low temperatures temperatures as high as 130 c 266 f 72 as low as 17 c 1 f 73 halophiles such as halobacterium salinarum an archaean thrive in high salt conditions up to saturation 74 alkaliphiles thrive in an alkaline ph of about 8.5 11 75 acidophiles can thrive in a ph of 2.0 or less 76 piezophiles thrive at very high pressures up to 1,000 2,000 atm down to 0 atm as in a vacuum of space 77 a few extremophiles such as deinococcus radiodurans are radioresistant 78 resisting radiation exposure of up to 5k gy extremophiles are significant in different ways they extend terrestrial life into much of the earth s hydrosphere crust and atmosphere their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their extreme environment can be exploited in biotechnology and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life 79 in soil edit the nitrogen cycle in soils depends on the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen this is achieved by a number of diazotrophs one way this can occur is in the nodules in the roots of legumes that contain symbiotic bacteria of the genera rhizobium mesorhizobium sinorhizobium bradyrhizobium and azorhizobium 80 symbiosis edit the photosynthetic cyanobacterium hyella caespitosa round shapes with fungal hyphae translucent threads in the lichen pyrenocollema halodytes a lichen is a symbiosis of a macroscopic fungus with photosynthetic microbial algae or cyanobacteria 81 82 applications edit microorganisms are useful in producing foods treating waste water creating biofuels and a wide range of chemicals and enzymes they are invaluable in research as model organisms they have been weaponised and sometimes used in warfare and bioterrorism they are vital to agriculture through their roles in maintaining soil fertility and in decomposing organic matter 83 food production edit microorganisms are used in a fermentation process to make yoghurt cheese curd kefir ayran xynogala and other types of food fermentation cultures provide flavor and aroma and inhibit undesirable organisms 84 they are used to leaven bread and to convert sugars to alcohol in wine and beer microorganisms are used in brewing wine making baking pickling and other food-making processes 85 water treatment edit wastewater treatment plants rely largely on microorganisms to oxidise organic matter sewage treatment works depend for their ability to clean up water contaminated with organic material on microorganisms that can respire dissolved substances respiration may be aerobic with a well-oxygenated filter bed such as a slow sand filter 86 anaerobic digestion by methanogens generate useful methane gas as a by-product 87 energy edit microorganisms are used in fermentation to produce ethanol 88 and in biogas reactors to produce methane 89 scientists are researching the use of algae to produce liquid fuels 90 and bacteria to convert various forms of agricultural and urban waste into usable fuels 91 chemicals enzymes edit microorganisms are used to produce many commercial and industrial chemicals enzymes and other bioactive molecules organic acids produced on a large industrial scale by microbial fermentation include acetic acid produced by acetic acid bacteria such as acetobacter aceti butyric acid made by the bacterium clostridium butyricum lactic acid made by lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria 92 and citric acid produced by the mould fungus aspergillus niger 92 microorganisms are used to prepare bioactive molecules such as streptokinase from the bacterium streptococcus 93 cyclosporin a from the ascomycete fungus tolypocladium inflatum 94 and statins produced by the yeast monascus purpureus 95 science edit a laboratory fermentation vessel microorganisms are essential tools in biotechnology biochemistry genetics and molecular biology the yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe are important model organisms in science since they are simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated 96 they are particularly valuable in genetics genomics and proteomics 97 98 microorganisms can be harnessed for uses such as creating steroids and treating skin diseases scientists are also considering using microorganisms for living fuel cells 99 and as a solution for pollution 100 warfare edit in the middle ages as an early example of biological warfare diseased corpses were thrown into castles during sieges using catapults or other siege engines individuals near the corpses were exposed to the pathogen and were likely to spread that pathogen to others 101 in modern times bioterrorism has included the 1984 rajneeshee bioterror attack 102 and the 1993 release of anthrax by aum shinrikyo in tokyo 103 soil edit microbes can make nutrients and minerals in the soil available to plants produce hormones that spur growth stimulate the plant immune system and trigger or dampen stress responses in general a more diverse set of soil microbes results in fewer plant diseases and higher yield 104 human health edit human gut flora edit microorganisms can form an endosymbiotic relationship with other larger organisms for example microbial symbiosis plays a crucial role in the immune system the microorganisms that make up the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates 105 some microorganisms that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements or food additives 106 disease edit the eukaryotic parasite plasmodium falciparum spiky blue shapes a causative agent of malaria in human blood microorganisms are the causative agents pathogens in many infectious diseases the organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria causing diseases such as plague tuberculosis and anthrax protozoa causing diseases such as malaria sleeping sickness dysentery and toxoplasmosis and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm candidiasis or histoplasmosis however other diseases such as influenza yellow fever or aids are caused by pathogenic viruses which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not therefore microorganisms by the strict definition no clear examples of archaean pathogens are known 107 although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease 108 hygiene edit hygiene is a set of practices to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings as microorganisms in particular bacteria are found virtually everywhere harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated in food preparation microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking cleanliness of utensils short storage periods or by low temperatures if complete sterility is needed as with surgical equipment an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure 109 110 see also
