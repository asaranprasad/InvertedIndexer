origin and subsequent evolution of photosynthesis the process by which light energy synthesizes sugars from carbon dioxide releasing oxygen as a waste product the first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or electrons rather than water 1 there are three major metabolic pathways by which

as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria 2 the geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in earth s history at least 2450 2320 million years ago ma and it is speculated much earlier 3 4 available evidence from geobiological studies of archean 2500 ma sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed 3500 ma but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered a clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 ma revealing an already-diverse biota of blue-greens cyanobacteria remained principal primary producers throughout the proterozoic eon 2500 543 ma in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation citation needed green algae joined blue-greens as major primary producers on continental shelves near the end of the proterozoic but only with the mesozoic 251 65 ma radiations of dinoflagellates coccolithophorids and diatoms did primary production in marine shelf waters take modern form cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers in oceanic gyres as agents of biological nitrogen fixation and in modified form as the plastids of marine algae 5 early photosynthetic systems such as those from green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria are thought to have been anoxygenic using various molecules as electron donors green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as an electron donor green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old 6 7 the main source of oxygen in the atmosphere is oxygenic photosynthesis and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis such as that in cyanobacteria became important during the paleoproterozoic era around 2 billion years ago modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor which is oxidized to molecular oxygen o 2 in the photosynthetic reaction center symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts edit plant cells with visible chloroplasts from a moss plagiomnium affine several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae these are most common in corals sponges and sea anemones it is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes 8 in addition a few marine mollusks elysia viridis and elysia chlorotica also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies this allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time 9 10 some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive 11 an even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria including a circular chromosome prokaryotic-type ribosomes and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center 12 13 the endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired by endocytosis by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells therefore chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells like mitochondria chloroplasts still possess their own dna separate from the nuclear dna of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast dna resemble those in cyanobacteria 14 dna in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as photosynthetic reaction centers the corr hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation a 2010 study by researchers at tel aviv university discovered that the oriental hornet vespa orientalis converts sunlight into electric power using a pigment called xanthopterin this is the first scientific evidence of a member of the animal kingdom engaging in photosynthesis 15 evolution of photosynthetic pathways edit the c 4 carbon concentrating mechanism photosynthesis is not quite as simple as adding water to co2 to produce sugars and oxygen a complex chemical pathway is involved facilitated along the way by a range of enzymes and co-enzymes the enzyme rubisco is responsible for fixing co2 that is it attaches it to a carbon-based molecule to form a sugar which can be used by the plant releasing an oxygen molecule along the way however the enzyme is notoriously inefficient and just as effectively will also fix oxygen instead of co2 in a process called photorespiration this is energetically costly as the plant has to use energy to turn the products of photorespiration back into a form that can react with co2 concentrating carbon edit the c4 metabolic pathway is a valuable recent evolutionary innovation in plants involving a complex set of adaptive changes to physiology and gene expression patterns 16 about 7600 species of plants use c4 carbon fixation which represents about 3 of all terrestrial species of plants all these 7600 species are angiosperms c4 plants evolved carbon concentrating mechanisms these work by increasing the concentration of co2 around rubisco thereby facilitating photosynthesis and decreasing photorespiration the process of concentrating co2 around rubisco requires more energy than allowing gases to diffuse but under certain conditions i e warm temperatures 25 c low co2 concentrations or high oxygen concentrations pays off in terms of the decreased loss of sugars through photorespiration one type of c4 metabolism employs a so-called kranz anatomy this transports co2 through an outer mesophyll layer via a range of organic molecules to the central bundle sheath cells where the co2 is released in this way co2 is concentrated near the site of rubisco operation because rubisco is operating in an environment with much more co2 than it otherwise would be it performs more efficiently a second mechanism cam photosynthesis is a carbon fixation pathway that evolved in some plants as an adaptation to arid conditions 17 18 the most important benefit of cam to the plant is the ability to leave most leaf stomata closed during the day 19 this reduces water loss due to evapotranspiration the stomata open at night to collect co2 which is stored as the four-carbon acid malate and then used during photosynthesis during the day the pre-collected co2 is concentrated around the enzyme rubisco increasing photosynthetic efficiency more co2 is then harvested from the atmosphere when stomata open during the cool moist nights reducing water loss cam has evolved convergently many times 20 it occurs in 16,000 species about 7 of plants belonging to over 300 genera and around 40 families but this is thought to be a considerable underestimate 21 it is found in quillworts relatives of club mosses in ferns and in gymnosperms but the great majority of plants using cam are angiosperms flowering plants evolutionary record edit these two pathways with the same effect on rubisco evolved a number of times independently indeed c4 alone arose 62 times in 18 different plant families a number of pre-adaptations seem to have paved the way for c4 leading to its clustering in certain clades it has most frequently been innovated in plants that already had features such as extensive vascular bundle sheath tissue 22 many potential evolutionary pathways resulting in the c4 phenotype are possible and have been characterised using bayesian inference 16 confirming that non-photosynthetic adaptations often provide evolutionary stepping stones for the further evolution of c4 cam is named after the family crassulaceae to which the jade plant belongs another example of a cam plant is the pineapple the c4 construction is most famously used by a subset of grasses while cam is employed by many succulents and cacti the trait appears to have emerged during the oligocene around million years ago 23 however they did not become ecologically significant until the miocene million years ago 24 remarkably some charcoalified fossils preserve tissue organised into the kranz anatomy with intact bundle sheath cells 25 allowing the presence c4 metabolism to be identified without doubt at this time isotopic markers are used to deduce their distribution and significance c3 plants preferentially use the lighter of two isotopes of carbon in the atmosphere 12c which is more readily involved in the chemical pathways involved in its fixation because c4 metabolism involves a further chemical step this effect is accentuated plant material can be analysed to deduce the ratio of the heavier 13c to 12c this ratio is denoted 13c c3 plants are on average around 14 parts per thousand lighter than the atmospheric ratio while c4 plants are about 28 lighter the 13c of cam plants depends on the percentage of carbon fixed at night relative to what is fixed in the day being closer to c3 plants if they fix most carbon in the day and closer to c4 plants if they fix all their carbon at night 26 it is troublesome procuring original fossil material in sufficient quantity to analyse the grass itself but fortunately there is a good proxy horses horses were globally widespread in the period of interest and browsed almost exclusively on grasses there s an old phrase in isotope pal ontology you are what you eat plus a little bit this refers to the fact that organisms reflect the isotopic composition of whatever they eat plus a small adjustment factor there is a good record of horse teeth throughout the globe and their 13c has been measured the record shows a sharp negative inflection around million years ago during the messinian and this is interpreted as the rise of c4 plants on a global scale 24 when is c4 an advantage edit while c4 enhances the efficiency of rubisco the concentration of carbon is highly energy intensive this means that c4 plants only have an advantage over c3 organisms in certain conditions namely high temperatures and low rainfall c4 plants also need high levels of sunlight to thrive 27 models suggest that without wildfires removing shade-casting trees and shrubs there would be no space for c4 plants 28 but wildfires have occurred for 400 million years why did c4 take so long to arise and then appear independently so many times the carboniferous period million years ago had notoriously high oxygen levels almost enough to allow spontaneous combustion 29 and very low co2 but there is no c4 isotopic signature to be found and there doesn t seem to be a sudden trigger for the miocene rise during the miocene the atmosphere and climate were relatively stable if anything co2 increased gradually from million years ago before settling down to concentrations similar to the holocene 30 this suggests that it did not have a key role in invoking c4 evolution 23 grasses themselves the group which would give rise to the most occurrences of c4 had probably been around for 60 million years or more so had had plenty of time to evolve c4 31 32 which in any case is present in a diverse range of groups and thus evolved independently there is a strong signal of climate change in south asia 23 increasing aridity hence increasing fire frequency and intensity may have led to an increase in the importance of grasslands 33 however this is difficult to reconcile with the north american record 23 it is possible that the signal is entirely biological forced by the fire- and elephant - 34 driven acceleration of grass evolution which both by increasing weathering and incorporating more carbon into sediments reduced atmospheric co2 levels 34 finally there is evidence that the onset of c4 from million years ago is a biased signal which only holds true for north america from where most samples originate emerging evidence suggests that grasslands evolved to a dominant state at least 15ma earlier in south america
