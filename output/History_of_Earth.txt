formation to the present day 1 2 nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to the understanding of the main events of earth s past the age of the earth is approximately one-third of the age of the universe an immense amount of geological change has occurred in that timespan accompanied by the emergence of life and its subsequent evolution earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the solar nebula 3 4 5 volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen and so would not have supported known forms of life much of the earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism a giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named theia while earth was in its earliest stage also known as early earth is thought to have been responsible for forming the moon over time the earth cooled causing the formation of a solid crust and allowing liquid water to exist on the surface the geological time scale gts depicts the larger spans of time from the beginning of the earth to the present and it chronicles some definitive events of earth history the hadean eon represents time before the reliable fossil record of life beginning on earth it began with the formation of the planet and ended at 4.0 billion years ago as defined by international convention 6 the archean and proterozoic eons follow they produced the abiogenesis of life on earth and then the evolution of early life the succeeding eon is the phanerozoic which is represented by its three component eras the palaeozoic the mesozoic which spanned the rise reign and climactic extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and the cenozoic which presented the subsequent development of dominant mammals on earth hominins the earliest direct ancestors of the human clade rose sometime during the latter part of the miocene epoch the precise time marking the first hominins is broadly debated over a current range of 13 to 4 million years ago the succeeding quaternary period is the time of recognizable humans i e the genus homo but that period s two million-year-plus term of the recent times is too small to be visible at the scale of the gts graphic notes re the graphic ga means billion years ma million years the earliest undisputed evidence of life on earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago 7 8 9 during the eoarchean era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten hadean eon there are microbial mat fossils such as stromatolites found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in western australia 10 11 12 other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern greenland 13 as well as remains of biotic life found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia 14 15 according to one of the researchers if life arose relatively quickly on earth then it could be common in the universe 14 photosynthetic organisms appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the atmosphere with oxygen life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago when complex multicellular life arose developed over time and culminated in the cambrian explosion about 541 million years ago this event drove a rapid diversification of life forms on earth that produced most of the major phyla known today and it marked the end of the proterozoic eon and the beginning of the cambrian period of the paleozoic era more than 99 percent of all species amounting to over five billion species 16 that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct 17 18 estimates on the number of earth s current species range from 10 million to 14 million 19 of which about 1.2 million are documented but over 86 percent have not been described 20 scientists recently reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described 21 the earth s crust has constantly changed since its formation likewise life has constantly changed since its first appearance species continue to evolve taking on new forms splitting into daughter species or going extinct in the process of adapting or dying in response to ever-changing physical environments the process of plate tectonics continues to shape the earth s continents and oceans and the life they harbor human activity is now a dominant force affecting global change adversely affecting the biosphere the earth s surface hydrosphere and atmosphere with the loss of wild lands over-exploitation of the oceans production of greenhouse gases degradation of the ozone layer and general

period of approximately 1,000,000 years in the past the history of earth is divided into four great eons starting 4,540 mya with the formation of the planet each eon saw the most significant changes in earth s composition climate and life each eon is subsequently divided into eras which in turn are divided into periods which are further divided into epochs eon time mya description hadean 4,540 4,000 the earth is formed out of debris around the solar protoplanetary disk there is no life temperatures are extremely hot with frequent volcanic activity and hellish environments the atmosphere is

current of earth s atmospheres plants later animals and possibly earlier forms of fungi form around this time the early and late phases of this eon may have undergone snowball earth periods in which all of the planet suffered below-zero temperatures the early continents of columbia rodinia and pannotia may have formed around this time in that order phanerozoic 541 present complex life including vertebrates begin to dominate the earth s ocean in a process known as the cambrian explosion pangaea forms and later dissolves into laurasia and gondwana gradually life expands to land and all familiar forms of plants animals and fungi begin appearing including annelids insects and reptiles several mass extinctions occur among which birds the descendants of dinosaurs and more recently mammals emerge modern animals including humans evolve at the most recent phases of this eon geologic time scale edit the history of the earth can be organized chronologically according to the geologic time scale which is split into intervals based on stratigraphic analysis 2 22 the following four timelines show the geologic time scale the first shows the entire time from the formation of the earth to the present but this gives little space for the most recent eon therefore the second timeline shows an expanded view of the most recent eon in a similar way the most recent era is expanded in the third timeline and the most recent period is expanded in the fourth timeline millions of years solar system formation edit an artist s rendering of a protoplanetary disk the standard model for the formation of the solar system including the earth is the solar nebula hypothesis 23 in this model the solar system formed from a large rotating cloud of interstellar dust and gas called the solar nebula it was composed of hydrogen and helium created shortly after the big bang 13.8 ga billion years ago and heavier elements ejected by supernovae about 4.5 ga the nebula began a contraction that may have been triggered by the shock wave from a nearby supernova 24 a shock wave would have also made the nebula rotate as the cloud began to accelerate its angular momentum gravity and inertia flattened it into a protoplanetary disk perpendicular to its axis of rotation small perturbations due to collisions and the angular momentum of other large debris created the means by which kilometer-sized protoplanets began to form orbiting the nebular center 25 the center of the nebula not having much angular momentum collapsed rapidly the compression heating it until nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium began after more contraction a t tauri star ignited and evolved into the sun meanwhile in the outer part of the nebula gravity caused matter to condense around density perturbations and dust particles and the rest of the protoplanetary disk began separating into rings in a process known as runaway accretion successively larger fragments of dust and debris clumped together to form planets 25 earth formed in this manner about 4.54 billion years ago with an uncertainty of 1 26 27 3 28 and was largely completed within 10 20 million years 29 the solar wind of the newly formed t tauri star cleared out most of the material in the disk that had not already condensed into larger bodies the same process is expected to produce accretion disks around virtually all newly forming stars in the universe some of which yield planets 30 the proto-earth grew by accretion until its interior was hot enough to melt the heavy siderophile metals having higher densities than the silicates these metals sank this so-called iron catastrophe resulted in the separation of a primitive mantle and a metallic core only 10 million years after the earth began to form producing the layered structure of earth and setting up the formation of earth s magnetic field 31 j a jacobs 32 was the first to suggest that the inner core a solid center distinct from the liquid outer core is freezing and growing out of the liquid outer core due to the gradual cooling of earth s interior about 100 degrees celsius per billion years 33 hadean and archean eons edit artist s conception of hadean eon earth when it was much hotter and inhospitable to all forms of life the first eon in earth s history the hadean begins with the earth s formation and is followed by the archean eon at 3.8 ga 2 145 the oldest rocks found on earth date to about 4.0 ga and the oldest detrital zircon crystals in rocks to about 4.4 ga 34 35 36 soon after the formation of the earth s crust and the earth itself the giant impact hypothesis for the moon s formation states that shortly after formation of an initial crust the proto-earth was impacted by a smaller protoplanet which ejected part of the mantle and crust into space and created the moon 37 38 39 from crater counts on other celestial bodies it is inferred that a period of intense meteorite impacts called the late heavy bombardment began about 4.1 ga and concluded around 3.8 ga at the end of the hadean 40 in addition volcanism was severe due to the large heat flow and geothermal gradient 41 nevertheless detrital zircon crystals dated to 4.4 ga show evidence of having undergone contact with liquid water suggesting that the earth already had oceans or seas at that time 34 by the beginning of the archean the earth had cooled significantly present life forms could not have survived at earth s surface because the archean atmosphere lacked oxygen hence had no ozone layer to block ultraviolet light nevertheless it is believed that primordial life began to evolve by the early archean with candidate fossils dated to around 3.5 ga 42 some scientists even speculate that life could have begun during the early hadean as far back as 4.4 ga surviving the possible late heavy bombardment period in hydrothermal vents below the earth s surface 43 formation of the moon edit artist s impression of the enormous collision that probably formed the moon earth s only natural satellite the moon is larger relative to its planet than any other satellite in the solar system nb 1 during the apollo program rocks from the moon s surface were brought to earth radiometric dating of these rocks shows that the moon is 4.53 0.01 billion years old 46 formed at least 30 million years after the solar system 47 new evidence suggests the moon formed even later 4.48 0.02 ga or 70 110 million years after the start of the solar system 48 theories for the formation of the moon must explain its late formation as well as the following facts first the moon has a low density 3.3 times that of water compared to 5.5 for the earth 49 and a small metallic core second there is virtually no water or other volatiles on the moon third the earth and moon have the same oxygen isotopic signature relative abundance of the oxygen isotopes of the theories proposed to account for these phenomena one is widely accepted the giant impact hypothesis proposes that the moon originated after a body the size of mars sometimes named theia 47 struck the proto-earth a glancing blow 1 256 50 51 the collision released about 100 million times more energy than the more recent chicxulub impact that is believed to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs it was enough to vaporize some of the earth s outer layers and melt both bodies 50 1 256 a portion of the mantle material was ejected into orbit around the earth the giant impact hypothesis predicts that the moon was depleted of metallic material 52 explaining its abnormal composition 53 the ejecta in orbit around the earth could have condensed into a single body within a couple of weeks under the influence of its own gravity the ejected material became a more spherical body the moon 54 first continents edit geologic map of north america color-coded by age the reds and pinks indicate rock from the archean mantle convection the process that drives plate tectonics is a result of heat flow from the earth s interior to the earth s surface 55 2 it involves the creation of rigid tectonic plates at mid-oceanic ridges these plates are destroyed by subduction into the mantle at subduction zones during the early archean about 3.0 ga the mantle was much hotter than today probably around 1,600 c 2,910 f 56 82 so convection in the mantle was faster although a process similar to present-day plate tectonics did occur this would have gone faster too it is likely that during the hadean and archean subduction zones were more common and therefore tectonic plates were smaller 1 258 57 the initial crust formed when the earth s surface first solidified totally disappeared from a combination of this fast hadean plate tectonics and the intense impacts of the late heavy bombardment however it is thought that it was basaltic in composition like today s oceanic crust because little crustal differentiation had yet taken place 1 258 the first larger pieces of continental crust which is a product of differentiation of lighter elements during partial melting in the lower crust appeared at the end of the hadean about 4.0 ga what is left of these first small continents are called cratons these pieces of late hadean and early archean crust form the cores around which today s continents grew 58 the oldest rocks on earth are found in the north american craton of canada they are tonalites from about 4.0 ga they show traces of metamorphism by high temperature but also sedimentary grains that have been rounded by erosion during transport by water showing that rivers and seas existed then 59 cratons consist primarily of two alternating types of terranes the first are so-called greenstone belts consisting of low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary rocks these greenstones are similar to the sediments today found in oceanic trenches above subduction zones for this reason greenstones are sometimes seen as evidence for subduction during the archean the second type is a complex of felsic magmatic rocks these rocks are mostly tonalite trondhjemite or granodiorite types of rock similar in composition to granite hence such terranes are called ttg-terranes ttg-complexes are seen as the relicts of the first continental crust formed by partial melting in basalt 60 chapter 5 oceans and atmosphere edit graph showing range of estimated partial pressure of atmospheric oxygen through geologic time 61 earth is often described as having had three atmospheres the first atmosphere captured from the solar nebula was composed of light atmophile elements from the solar nebula mostly hydrogen and helium a combination of the solar wind and earth s heat would have driven off this atmosphere as a result of which the atmosphere is now depleted of these elements compared to cosmic abundances 62 after the impact which created the moon the molten earth released volatile gases and later more gases were released by volcanoes completing a second atmosphere rich in greenhouse gases but poor in oxygen 1 256 finally the third atmosphere rich in oxygen emerged when bacteria began to produce oxygen about 2.8 ga 63 83 84,116 117 in early models for the formation of the atmosphere and ocean the second atmosphere was formed by outgassing of volatiles from the earth s interior now it is considered likely that many of the volatiles were delivered during accretion by a process known as impact degassing in which incoming bodies vaporize on impact the ocean and atmosphere would therefore have started to form even as the earth formed 64 the new atmosphere probably contained water vapor carbon dioxide nitrogen and smaller amounts of other gases 65 planetesimals at a distance of 1 astronomical unit au the distance of the earth from the sun probably did not contribute any water to the earth because the solar nebula was too hot for ice to form and the hydration of rocks by water vapor would have taken too long 64 66 the water must have been supplied by meteorites from the outer asteroid belt and some large planetary embryos from beyond 2.5 au 64 67 comets may also have contributed though most comets are today in orbits farther away from the sun than neptune computer simulations show that they were originally far more common in the inner parts of the solar system 59 130 132 as the earth cooled clouds formed rain created the oceans recent evidence suggests the oceans may have begun forming as early as 4.4 ga 34 by the start of the archean eon they already covered much of the earth this early formation has been difficult to explain because of a problem known as the faint young sun paradox stars are known to get brighter as they age and at the time of its formation the sun would have been emitting only 70 of its current power thus the sun has become 30 brighter in the last 4.5 billion years 68 many models indicate that the earth would have been covered in ice 69 64 a likely solution is that there was enough carbon dioxide and methane to produce a greenhouse effect the carbon dioxide would have been produced by volcanoes and the methane by early microbes another greenhouse gas ammonia would have been ejected by volcanos but quickly destroyed by ultraviolet radiation 63 83 origin of life edit life timeline view discuss -4500 -4000 -3500 -3000 -2500 -2000 -1500 -1000 -500 0 water single-celled life photosynthesis eukaryotes multicellular life

ages also see human timeline and nature timeline one of the reasons for interest in the early atmosphere and ocean is that they form the conditions under which life first arose there are many models but little consensus on how life emerged from non-living chemicals chemical systems created in the laboratory fall well short of the minimum complexity for a living organism 70 71 the first step in the emergence of life may have been chemical reactions that produced many of the simpler organic compounds including nucleobases and amino acids that are the building blocks of life an experiment in 1953 by stanley miller and harold urey showed that such molecules could form in an atmosphere of water methane ammonia and hydrogen with the aid of sparks to mimic the effect of lightning 72 although atmospheric composition was probably different from that used by miller and urey later experiments with more realistic compositions also managed to synthesize organic molecules 73 computer simulations show that extraterrestrial organic molecules could have formed in the protoplanetary disk before the formation of the earth 74 additional complexity could have been reached from at least three possible starting points self-replication an organism s ability to produce offspring that are similar to itself metabolism its ability to feed and repair itself and external cell membranes which allow food to enter and waste products to leave but exclude unwanted substances 75 replication first rna world edit even the simplest members of the three modern domains of life use dna to record their recipes and a complex array of rna and protein molecules to read these instructions and use them for growth maintenance and self-replication the discovery that a kind of rna molecule called a ribozyme can catalyze both its own replication and the construction of proteins led to the hypothesis that earlier life-forms were based entirely on rna 76 they could have formed an rna world in which there were individuals but no species as mutations and horizontal gene transfers would have meant that the offspring in each generation were quite likely to have different genomes from those that their parents started with 77 rna would later have been replaced by dna which is more stable and therefore can build longer genomes expanding the range of capabilities a single organism can have 78 ribozymes remain as the main components of ribosomes the protein factories of modern cells 79 although short self-replicating rna molecules have been artificially produced in laboratories 80 doubts have been raised about whether natural non-biological synthesis of rna is possible 81 82 83 the earliest ribozymes may have been formed of simpler nucleic acids such as pna tna or gna which would have been replaced later by rna 84 85 other pre-rna replicators have been posited including crystals 86 150 and even quantum systems 87 in 2003 it was proposed that porous metal sulfide precipitates would assist rna synthesis at about 100 c 212 f and ocean-bottom pressures near hydrothermal vents in this hypothesis lipid membranes would be the last major cell components to appear and until they did the proto-cells would be confined to the pores 88 metabolism first iron sulfur world edit the replicator in virtually all known life is deoxyribonucleic acid dna is far more complex than the original replicator and its replication systems are highly elaborate another long-standing hypothesis is that the first life was composed of protein molecules amino acids the building blocks of proteins are easily synthesized in plausible prebiotic conditions as are small peptides polymers of amino acids that make good catalysts 89 295 297 a series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that amino acids and peptides could form in the presence of carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide with iron sulfide and nickel sulfide as catalysts most of the steps in their assembly required temperatures of about 100 c 212 f and moderate pressures although one stage required 250 c 482 f and a pressure equivalent to that found under 7 kilometers 4.3 mi of rock hence self-sustaining synthesis of proteins could have occurred near hydrothermal vents 90 a difficulty with the metabolism-first scenario is finding a way for organisms to evolve without the ability to replicate as individuals aggregates of molecules would have compositional genomes counts of molecular species in the aggregate as the target of natural selection however a recent model shows that such a system is unable to evolve in response to natural selection 91 membranes first lipid world edit it has been suggested that double-walled bubbles of lipids like those that form the external membranes of cells may have been an essential first step 92 experiments that simulated the conditions of the early earth have reported the formation of lipids and these can spontaneously form liposomes double-walled bubbles and then reproduce themselves although they are not intrinsically information-carriers as nucleic acids are they would be subject to natural selection for longevity and reproduction nucleic acids such as rna might then have formed more easily within the liposomes than they would have outside 93 the clay theory edit some clays notably montmorillonite have properties that make them plausible accelerators for the emergence of an rna world they grow by self-replication of their crystalline pattern are subject to an analog of natural selection as the clay species that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant and can catalyze the formation of rna molecules 94 although this idea has not become the scientific consensus it still has active supporters 95 150 158 86 cross-section through a liposome research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of fatty acids into bubbles and that the bubbles could encapsulate rna attached to the clay bubbles can then grow by absorbing additional lipids and dividing the formation of the earliest cells may have been aided by similar processes 96 a similar hypothesis presents self-replicating iron-rich clays as the progenitors of nucleotides lipids and amino acids 97 last universal ancestor edit it is believed that of this multiplicity of protocells only one line survived current phylogenetic evidence suggests that the last universal ancestor lua lived during the early archean eon perhaps 3.5 ga or earlier 98 99 this lua cell is the ancestor of all life on earth today it was probably a prokaryote possessing a cell membrane and probably ribosomes but lacking a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts like modern cells it used dna as its genetic code rna for information transfer and protein synthesis and enzymes to catalyze reactions some scientists believe that instead of a single organism being the last universal common ancestor there were populations of organisms exchanging genes by lateral gene transfer 98 proterozoic eon edit the proterozoic eon lasted from 2.5 ga to 542 ma million years ago 2 130 in this time span cratons grew into continents with modern sizes the change to an oxygen-rich atmosphere was a crucial development life developed from prokaryotes into eukaryotes and multicellular forms the proterozoic saw a couple of severe ice ages called snowball earths after the last snowball earth about 600 ma the evolution of life on earth accelerated about 580 ma the ediacaran biota formed the prelude for the cambrian explosion citation needed oxygen revolution edit lithified stromatolites on the shores of lake thetis western australia archean stromatolites are the first direct fossil traces of life on earth a banded iron formation from the 3.15 ga moories group barberton greenstone belt south africa red layers represent the times when oxygen was available gray layers were formed in anoxic circumstances the earliest cells absorbed energy and food from the surrounding environment they used fermentation the breakdown of more complex compounds into less complex compounds with less energy and used the energy so liberated to grow and reproduce fermentation can only occur in an anaerobic oxygen-free environment the evolution of photosynthesis made it possible for cells to derive energy from the sun 100 377 most of the life that covers the surface of the earth depends directly or indirectly on photosynthesis the most common form oxygenic photosynthesis turns carbon dioxide water and sunlight into food it captures the energy of sunlight in energy-rich molecules such as atp which then provide the energy to make sugars to supply the electrons in the circuit hydrogen is stripped from water leaving oxygen as a waste product 101 some organisms including purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria use an anoxygenic form of photosynthesis that uses alternatives to hydrogen stripped from water as electron donors examples are hydrogen sulfide sulfur and iron such extremophile organisms are restricted to otherwise inhospitable environments such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents 100 379 382 102 the simpler anoxygenic form arose about 3.8 ga not long after the appearance of life the timing of oxygenic photosynthesis is more controversial it had certainly appeared by about 2.4 ga but some researchers put it back as far as 3.2 ga 101 the latter probably increased global productivity by at least two or three orders of magnitude 103 104 among the oldest remnants of oxygen-producing lifeforms are fossil stromatolites 103 104 61 at first the released oxygen was bound up with limestone iron and other minerals the oxidized iron appears as red layers in geological strata called banded iron formations that formed in abundance during the siderian period between 2500 ma and 2300 ma 2 133 when most of the exposed readily reacting minerals were oxidized oxygen finally began to accumulate in the atmosphere though each cell only produced a minute amount of oxygen the combined metabolism of many cells over a vast time transformed earth s atmosphere to its current state this was earth s third atmosphere 105 50 51 63 83 84,116 117 some oxygen was stimulated by solar ultraviolet radiation to form ozone which collected in a layer near the upper part of the atmosphere the ozone layer absorbed and still absorbs a significant amount of the ultraviolet radiation that once had passed through the atmosphere it allowed cells to colonize the surface of the ocean and eventually the land without the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation bombarding land and sea would have caused unsustainable levels of mutation in exposed cells 106 59 219 220 photosynthesis had another major impact oxygen was toxic much life on earth probably died out as its levels rose in what is known as the oxygen catastrophe resistant forms survived and thrived and some developed the ability to use oxygen to increase their metabolism and obtain more energy from the same food 106 snowball earth edit the natural evolution of the sun made it progressively more luminous during the archean and proterozoic eons the sun s luminosity increases 6 every billion years 59 165 as a result the earth began to receive more heat from the sun in the proterozoic eon however the earth did not get warmer instead the geological record suggests it cooled dramatically during the early proterozoic glacial deposits found in south africa date back to 2.2 ga at which time based on paleomagnetic evidence they must have been located near the equator thus this glaciation known as the huronian glaciation may have been global some scientists suggest this was so severe that the earth was frozen over from the poles to the equator a hypothesis called snowball earth 107 the huronian ice age might have been caused by the increased oxygen concentration in the atmosphere which caused the decrease of methane ch4 in the atmosphere methane is a strong greenhouse gas but with oxygen it reacts to form co2 a less effective greenhouse gas 59 172 when free oxygen became available in the atmosphere the concentration of methane could have decreased dramatically enough to counter the effect of the increasing heat flow from the sun 108 however the term snowball earth is more commonly used to describe later extreme ice ages during the cryogenian period there were four periods each lasting about 10 million years between 750 and 580 million years ago when the earth is thought to have been covered with ice apart from the highest mountains and average temperatures were about 50 c 58 f 109 the snowball may have been partly due to the location of the supercontintent rodinia straddling the equator carbon dioxide combines with rain to weather rocks to form carbonic acid which is then washed out to sea thus extracting the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere when the continents are near the poles the advance of ice covers the rocks slowing the reduction in carbon dioxide but in the cryogienian the weathering of rodinia was able to continue unchecked until the ice advanced to the tropics the process may have finally been reversed by the emission of carbon dioxide from volcanoes or the destabilization of methane gas hydrates according to the alternative slushball earth theory even at the height of the ice ages there was still open water at the equator 110 111 emergence of eukaryotes edit chloroplasts in the cells of a moss modern taxonomy classifies life into three domains the time of their origin is uncertain the bacteria domain probably first split off from the other forms of life sometimes called neomura but this supposition is controversial soon after this by 2 ga 112 the neomura split into the archaea and the eukarya eukaryotic cells eukarya are larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells bacteria and archaea and the origin of that complexity is only now becoming known citation needed around this time the first proto-mitochondrion was formed a bacterial cell related to today s rickettsia 113 which had evolved to metabolize oxygen entered a larger prokaryotic cell which lacked that capability perhaps the large cell attempted to digest the smaller one but failed possibly due to the evolution of prey defenses the smaller cell may have tried to parasitize the larger one in any case the smaller cell survived inside the larger cell using oxygen it metabolized the larger cell s waste products and derived more energy part of this excess energy was returned to the host the smaller cell replicated inside the larger one soon a stable symbiosis developed between the large cell and the smaller cells inside it over time the host cell acquired some genes from the smaller cells and the two kinds became dependent on each other the larger cell could not survive without the energy produced by the smaller ones and these in turn could not survive without the raw materials provided by the larger cell the whole cell is now considered a single organism and the smaller cells are classified as organelles called mitochondria 114 a similar event occurred with photosynthetic cyanobacteria 115 entering large heterotrophic cells and becoming chloroplasts 105 60 61 116 536 539 probably as a result of these changes a line of cells capable of photosynthesis split off from the other eukaryotes more than 1 billion years ago there were probably several such inclusion events besides the well-established endosymbiotic theory of the cellular origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts there are theories that cells led to peroxisomes spirochetes led to cilia and flagella and that perhaps a dna virus led to the cell nucleus 117 118 though none of them are widely accepted 119 archaeans bacteria and eukaryotes continued to diversify and to become more complex and better adapted to their environments each domain repeatedly split into multiple lineages although little is known about the history of the archaea and bacteria around 1.1 ga the supercontinent rodinia was assembling 120 121 the plant animal and fungi lines had split though they still existed as solitary cells some of these lived in colonies and gradually a division of labor began to take place for instance cells on the periphery might have started to assume different roles from those in the interior although the division between a colony with specialized cells and a multicellular organism is not always clear around 1 billion years ago 122 the first multicellular plants emerged probably green algae 123 possibly by around 900 ma 116 488 true multicellularity had also evolved in animals citation needed at first it probably resembled today s sponges which have totipotent cells that allow a disrupted organism to reassemble itself 116 483 487 as the division of labor was completed in all lines of multicellular organisms cells became more specialized and more dependent on each other isolated cells would die citation needed supercontinents in the proterozoic edit a reconstruction of pannotia 550 ma reconstructions of tectonic plate movement in the past 250 million years the cenozoic and mesozoic eras can be made reliably using fitting of continental margins ocean floor magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic poles no ocean crust dates back further than that so earlier reconstructions are more difficult paleomagnetic poles are supplemented by geologic evidence such as orogenic belts which mark the edges of ancient plates and past distributions of flora and fauna the further back in time the scarcer and harder to interpret the data get and the more uncertain the reconstructions 124 370 throughout the history of the earth there have been times when continents collided and formed a supercontinent which later broke up into new continents about 1000 to 830 ma most continental mass was united in the supercontinent rodinia 124 370 125 rodinia may have been preceded by early-middle proterozoic continents called nuna and columbia 124 374 126 127 after the break-up of rodinia about 800 ma the continents may have formed another short-lived supercontinent around 550 ma the hypothetical supercontinent is sometimes referred to as pannotia or vendia 128 321 322 the evidence for it is a phase of continental collision known as the pan-african orogeny which joined the continental masses of current-day africa south america antarctica and australia the existence of pannotia depends on the timing of the rifting between gondwana which included most of the landmass now in the southern hemisphere as well as the arabian peninsula and the indian subcontinent and laurentia roughly equivalent to current-day north america 124 374 it is at least certain that by the end of the proterozoic eon most of the continental mass lay united in a position around the south pole 129 late proterozoic climate and life edit a 580 million year old fossil of spriggina floundensi an animal from the ediacaran period such life forms could have been ancestors to the many new forms that originated in the cambrian explosion the end of the proterozoic saw at least two snowball earths so severe that the surface of the oceans may have been completely frozen this happened about 716.5 and 635 ma in the cryogenian period 130 the intensity and mechanism of both glaciations are still under investigation and harder to explain than the early proterozoic snowball earth 131 most paleoclimatologists think the cold episodes were linked to the formation of the supercontinent rodinia 132 because rodinia was centered on the equator rates of chemical weathering increased and carbon dioxide co2 was taken from the atmosphere because co2 is an important greenhouse gas climates cooled globally citation needed in the same way during the snowball earths most of the continental surface was covered with permafrost which decreased chemical weathering again leading to the end of the glaciations an alternative hypothesis is that enough carbon dioxide escaped through volcanic outgassing that the resulting greenhouse effect raised global temperatures 132 increased volcanic activity resulted from the break-up of rodinia at about the same time citation needed the cryogenian period was followed by the ediacaran period which was characterized by a rapid development of new multicellular lifeforms 133 whether there is a connection between the end of the severe ice ages and the increase in diversity of life is not clear but it does not seem coincidental the new forms of life called ediacara biota were larger and more diverse than ever though the taxonomy of most ediacaran life forms is unclear some were ancestors of groups of modern life 134 important developments were the origin of muscular and neural cells none of the ediacaran fossils had hard body parts like skeletons these first appear after the boundary between the proterozoic and phanerozoic eons or ediacaran and cambrian periods citation needed phanerozoic eon edit the phanerozoic is the current eon on earth which started approximately 542 million years ago it consists of three eras the paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic 22 and is the time when multi-cellular life greatly diversified into almost all the organisms known today 135 the paleozoic old life era was the first and longest era of the phanerozoic eon lasting from 542 to 251 ma 22 during the paleozoic many modern groups of life came into existence life colonized the land first plants then animals two major extinctions occurred the continents formed at the break-up of pannotia and rodinia at the end of the proterozoic slowly moved together again forming the supercontinent pangaea in the late paleozoic citation needed the mesozoic middle life era lasted from 251 ma to 66 ma 22 it is subdivided into the triassic jurassic and cretaceous periods the era began with the permian triassic extinction event the most severe extinction event in the fossil record 95 of the species on earth died out 136 it ended with the cretaceous paleogene extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs citation needed the cenozoic new life era began at 66 ma 22 and is subdivided into the paleogene neogene and quaternary periods these three periods are further split into seven sub-divisions with the paleogene composed of the paleocene eocene and oligocene the neocene divided into the miocene pliocene and the quaternary composed of the pleistocene and holocene 137 mammals birds amphibians crocodilians turtles and lepidosaurs survived the cretaceous paleogene extinction event that killed off the non-avian dinosaurs and many other forms of life and this is the era during which they diversified into their modern forms citation needed tectonics paleogeography and climate edit pangaea was a supercontinent that existed from about 300 to 180 ma the outlines of the modern continents and other landmasses are indicated on this map at the end of the proterozoic the supercontinent pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents laurentia baltica siberia and gondwana 138 during periods when continents move apart more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust the ocean floors rise during such periods this causes the sea level to rise therefore in the first half of the paleozoic large areas of the continents were below sea level citation needed early paleozoic climates were warmer than today but the end of the ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole where the huge continent gondwana was situated traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former gondwana during the late ordovician ice age a few mass extinctions took place in which many brachiopods trilobites bryozoa and corals disappeared these marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water 139 the continents laurentia and baltica collided between 450 and 400 ma during the caledonian orogeny to form laurussia also known as euramerica 140 traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in scandinavia scotland and the northern appalachians in the devonian period 416 359 ma 22 gondwana and siberia began to move towards laurussia the collision of siberia with laurussia caused the uralian orogeny the collision of gondwana with laurussia is called the variscan or hercynian orogeny in europe or the alleghenian orogeny in north america the latter phase took place during the carboniferous period 359 299 ma 22 and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent pangaea 60 by 180 ma pangaea broke up into laurasia and gondwana citation needed cambrian explosion edit trilobites first appeared during the cambrian period and were among the most widespread and diverse groups of paleozoic organisms the rate of the evolution of life as recorded by fossils accelerated in the cambrian period 542 488 ma 22 the sudden emergence of many new species phyla and forms in this period is called the cambrian explosion the biological fomenting in the cambrian explosion was unpreceded before and since that time 59 229 whereas the ediacaran life forms appear yet primitive and not easy to put in any modern group at the end of the cambrian most modern phyla were already present the development of hard body parts such as shells skeletons or exoskeletons in animals like molluscs echinoderms crinoids and arthropods a well-known group of arthropods from the lower paleozoic are the trilobites made the preservation and fossilization of such life forms easier than those of their proterozoic ancestors for this reason much more is known about life in and after the cambrian than about that of older periods some of these cambrian groups appear complex but are quite different from modern life examples are anomalocaris and haikouichthys citation needed during the cambrian the first vertebrate animals among them the first fishes had appeared 116 357 a creature that could have been the ancestor of the fishes or was probably closely related to it was pikaia it had a primitive notochord a structure that could have developed into a vertebral column later the first fishes with jaws gnathostomata appeared during the next geological period the ordovician the colonisation of new niches resulted in massive body sizes in this way fishes with increasing sizes evolved during the early paleozoic such as the titanic placoderm dunkleosteus which could grow 7 meters 23 ft long citation needed the diversity of life forms did not increase greatly because of a series of mass extinctions that define widespread biostratigraphic units called biomeres 141 after each extinction pulse the continental shelf regions were repopulated by similar life forms that may have been evolving slowly elsewhere 142 by the late cambrian the trilobites had reached their greatest diversity and dominated nearly all fossil assemblages 143 34 colonization of land edit artist s conception of devonian flora oxygen accumulation from photosynthesis resulted in the formation of an ozone layer that absorbed much of the sun s ultraviolet radiation meaning unicellular organisms that reached land were less likely to die and prokaryotes began to multiply and become better adapted to survival out of the water prokaryote lineages 144 had probably colonized the land as early as 2.6 ga 145 even before the origin of the eukaryotes for a long time the land remained barren of multicellular organisms the supercontinent pannotia formed around 600 ma and then broke apart a short 50 million years later 146 fish the earliest vertebrates evolved in the oceans around 530 ma 116 354 a major extinction event occurred near the end of the cambrian period 147 which ended 488 ma 148 several hundred million years ago plants probably resembling algae and fungi started growing at the edges of the water and then out of it 149 138 140 the oldest fossils of land fungi and plants date to 480 460 ma though molecular evidence suggests the fungi may have colonized the land as early as 1000 ma and the plants 700 ma 150 initially remaining close to the water s edge mutations and variations resulted in further colonization of this new environment the timing of the first animals to leave the oceans is not precisely known the oldest clear evidence is of arthropods on land around 450 ma 151 perhaps thriving and becoming better adapted due to the vast food source provided by the terrestrial plants there is also unconfirmed evidence that arthropods may have appeared on land as early as 530 ma 152 evolution of tetrapods edit tiktaalik a fish with limb-like fins and a predecessor of tetrapods reconstruction from fossils about 375 million years old at the end of the ordovician period 443 ma 22 additional extinction events occurred perhaps due to a concurrent ice age 139 around 380 to 375 ma the first tetrapods evolved from fish 153 fins evolved to become limbs that the first tetrapods used to lift their heads out of the water to breathe air this would let them live in oxygen-poor water or pursue small prey in shallow water 153 they may have later ventured on land for brief periods eventually some of them became so well adapted to terrestrial life that they spent their adult lives on land although they hatched in the water and returned to lay their eggs this was the origin of the amphibians about 365 ma another period of extinction occurred perhaps as a result of global cooling 154 plants evolved seeds which dramatically accelerated their spread on land around this time by approximately 360 ma 155 156 about 20 million years later 340 ma 116 293 296 the amniotic egg evolved which could be laid on land giving a survival advantage to tetrapod embryos this resulted in the divergence of amniotes from amphibians another 30 million years 310 ma 116 254 256 saw the divergence of the synapsids including mammals from the sauropsids including birds and reptiles other groups of organisms continued to evolve and lines diverged in fish insects bacteria and so on but less is known of the details citation needed dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates throughout most of the mesozoic after yet another the most severe extinction of the period 251 250 ma around 230 ma dinosaurs split off from their reptilian ancestors 157 the triassic jurassic extinction event at 200 ma spared many of the dinosaurs 22 158 and they soon became dominant among the vertebrates though some mammalian lines began to separate during this period existing mammals were probably small animals resembling shrews 116 169 the boundary between avian and non-avian dinosaurs is not clear but archaeopteryx traditionally considered one of the first birds lived around 150 ma 159 the earliest evidence for the angiosperms evolving flowers is during the cretaceous period some 20 million years later 132 ma 160 extinctions edit the first of five great mass extinctions was the ordovician-silurian extinction its possible cause was the intense glaciation of gondwana which eventually led to a snowball earth 60 of marine invertebrates became extinct and 25 of all families citation needed the second mass extinction was the late devonian extinction probably caused by the evolution of trees which could have led to the depletion of greenhouse gases like co2 or the eutrophication of water 70 of all species became extinct citation needed the third mass extinction was the permian-triassic or the great dying event was possibly caused by some combination of the siberian traps volcanic event an asteroid impact methane hydrate gasification sea level fluctuations and a major anoxic event either the proposed wilkes land crater 161 in antarctica or bedout structure off the northwest coast of australia may indicate an impact connection with the permian-triassic extinction but it remains uncertain whether either these or other proposed permian-triassic boundary craters are either real impact craters or even contemporaneous with the permian-triassic extinction event this was by far the deadliest extinction ever with about 57 of all families and 83 of all genera killed 162 163 the fourth mass extinction was the triassic-jurassic extinction event in which almost all synapsids and archosaurs became extinct probably due to new competition from dinosaurs citation needed the fifth and most recent mass extinction was the k-t extinction in 66 ma a 10-kilometer 6.2 mi asteroid struck earth just off the yucat n peninsula somewhere in the south western tip of then laurasia where the chicxulub crater is today this ejected vast quantities of particulate matter and vapor into the air that occluded sunlight inhibiting photosynthesis 75 of all life including the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct 164 marking the end of the cretaceous period and mesozoic era citation needed diversification of mammals edit the first true mammals evolved in the shadows of dinosaurs and other large archosaurs that filled the world by the late triassic the first mammals were very small and were probably nocturnal to escape predation mammal diversification truly began only after the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event 165 by the early paleocene the earth recovered from the extinction and mammalian diversity increased creatures like ambulocetus took to the oceans to eventually evolve into whales 166 whereas some creatures like primates took to the trees 167 this all changed during the mid to late eocene when the circum-antarctic current formed between antarctica and australia which disrupted weather patterns on a global scale grassless savannas began to predominate much of the landscape and mammals such as andrewsarchus rose up to become the largest known terrestrial predatory mammal ever 168 and early whales like basilosaurus took control of the seas citation needed the evolution of grass brought a remarkable change to the earth s landscape and the new open spaces created pushed mammals to get bigger and bigger grass started to expand in the miocene and the miocene is where many modern- day mammals first appeared giant ungulates like paraceratherium and deinotherium evolved to rule the grasslands the evolution of grass also brought primates down from the trees and started human evolution the first big cats evolved during this time as well 169 the tethys sea was closed off by the collision of africa and europe 170 the formation of panama was perhaps the most important geological event to occur in the last 60 million years atlantic and pacific currents were closed off from each other which caused the formation of the gulf stream which made europe warmer the land bridge allowed the isolated creatures of south america to migrate over to north america and vice versa 171 various species migrated south leading to the presence in south america of llamas the spectacled bear kinkajous and jaguars citation needed three million years ago saw the start of the pleistocene epoch which featured dramatic climactic changes due to the ice ages the ice ages led to the evolution of modern man in saharan africa and expansion the mega-fauna that dominated fed on grasslands that by now had taken over much of the subtropical world the large amounts of water held in the ice allowed for various bodies of water to shrink and sometimes disappear such as the north sea and the bering strait it is believed by many that a huge migration took place along beringia which is why today there are camels which evolved and became extinct in north america horses which evolved and became extinct in north america and native americans the ending of the last ice age coincided with the expansion of man along with a massive die out

reasons that are still unclear apes in one branch developed the ability to walk upright 116 95 99 brain size increased rapidly and by 2 ma the first animals classified in the genus homo had appeared 149 300 of course the line between different species or even genera is somewhat arbitrary as organisms continuously change over generations around the same time the other branch split into the ancestors of the common chimpanzee and the ancestors of the bonobo as evolution continued simultaneously in all life forms 116 100 101 the ability to control fire probably began in homo erectus or homo ergaster probably at least 790,000 years ago 172 but perhaps as early as 1.5 ma 116 67 the use and discovery of controlled fire may even predate homo erectus fire was possibly used by the early lower paleolithic oldowan hominid homo habilis or strong australopithecines such as paranthropus 173 a reconstruction of human history based on fossil data 174 it is more difficult to establish the origin of language it is unclear whether homo erectus could speak or if that capability had not begun until homo sapiens 116 67 as brain size increased babies were born earlier before their heads grew too large to pass through the pelvis as a result they exhibited more plasticity and thus possessed an increased capacity to learn and required a longer period of dependence social skills became more complex language became more sophisticated and tools became more elaborate this contributed to further cooperation and intellectual development 175 7 modern humans homo sapiens are believed to have originated around 200,000 years ago or earlier in africa the oldest fossils date back to around 160,000 years ago 176 the first humans to show signs of spirituality are the neanderthals usually classified as a separate species with no surviving descendants they buried their dead often with no sign of food or tools 177 17 however evidence of more sophisticated beliefs such as the early cro-magnon cave paintings probably with magical or religious significance 177 17 19 did not appear until 32,000 years ago 178 cro-magnons also left behind stone figurines such as venus of willendorf probably also signifying religious belief 177 17 19 by 11,000 years ago homo sapiens had reached the southern tip of south america the last of the uninhabited continents except for antarctica which

leonardo da vinci epitomizes the advances in art and science seen during the renaissance throughout more than 90 of its history homo sapiens lived in small bands as nomadic hunter-gatherers 175 8 as language became more complex the ability to remember and communicate information resulted according to a theory proposed by richard dawkins in a new replicator the meme 180 ideas could be exchanged quickly and passed down the generations cultural evolution quickly outpaced biological evolution and history proper began between 8500 and 7000 bc humans in the fertile crescent in the middle east began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals agriculture 181 this spread to neighboring regions and developed independently elsewhere until most homo sapiens lived sedentary lives in permanent settlements as farmers not all societies abandoned nomadism especially those in isolated areas of the globe poor in domesticable plant species such as australia 182 however among those civilizations that did adopt agriculture the relative stability and increased productivity provided by farming allowed the population to expand citation needed agriculture had a major impact humans began to affect the environment as never before surplus food allowed a priestly or governing class to arise followed by increasing division of labor this led to earth s first civilization at sumer in the middle east between 4000 and 3000 bc 175 15 additional civilizations quickly arose in ancient egypt at the indus river valley and in china the invention of writing enabled complex societies to arise record-keeping and libraries served as a storehouse of knowledge and increased the cultural transmission of information humans no longer had to spend all their time working for survival enabling the first specialized occupations e g craftsmen merchants priests etc curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom and various disciplines including science in a primitive form arose this in turn led to the emergence of increasingly larger and more complex civilizations such as the first empires which at times traded with one another or fought for territory and resources by around 500 bc there were advanced civilizations in the middle east iran india china and greece at times expanding at times entering into decline 175 3 in 221 bc china became a single polity that would grow to spread its culture throughout east asia and it has remained the most populous nation in the world the fundamentals of western civilization were largely shaped in ancient greece with the world s first democratic government and major advances in philosophy science and mathematics and in ancient rome in law government and engineering 183 the roman empire was christianized by emperor constantine in the early 4th century and declined by the end of the 5th beginning with the 7th century christianization of europe began in 610 islam was founded and quickly became the dominant religion in western asia the house of wisdom was established in abbasid-era baghdad iraq 184 it is considered to have been a major intellectual center during the islamic golden age where muslim scholars in baghdad and

colonial era also see age of discovery 175 295 299 in the 18th century a cultural movement known as the age of enlightenment further shaped the mentality of europe and contributed to its secularization from 1914 to 1918 and 1939 to 1945 nations around the world were embroiled in world wars established following world war i the league of nations was a first step in establishing international institutions to settle disputes peacefully after failing to prevent world war ii mankind s bloodiest conflict it was replaced by the united nations after the war many new states were formed declaring or being granted independence in a period of decolonization the united states and soviet union became the world s dominant superpowers for a time and they held an often-violent
