is a widely used chemical compound it is a white caustic alkaline crystalline solid at room temperature the broadly used term lime connotes calcium-containing inorganic materials in which carbonates oxides and hydroxides of calcium silicon magnesium aluminium and iron predominate by contrast quicklime specifically applies to the single chemical compound calcium oxide calcium oxide that survives processing without reacting in building products such as cement is called free lime 5 quicklime is relatively inexpensive both it and a chemical derivative calcium hydroxide of which quicklime is the base anhydride are important commodity chemicals contents 1 preparation 2 usage 2.1 as a weapon 3 safety 4 references 5 external links preparation edit calcium oxide is usually made by the thermal decomposition of materials such as limestone or seashells that contain calcium carbonate caco3 mineral calcite in a lime kiln this is accomplished by heating the material to above 825 c 1,517 f 6 a process called calcination or lime-burning to liberate a molecule of carbon dioxide co2 leaving quicklime caco 3 s cao s co 2 g the quicklime is not stable and when cooled will spontaneously react with co2 from the air until after enough time it will be completely converted back to calcium carbonate unless slaked with water to set as lime plaster or lime mortar annual worldwide production of quicklime is around 283 million tonnes china is by far the world s largest producer with a total of around 170 million tonnes per year the united states is the next largest with around 20 million tonnes per year 7 approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime quicklime has a high affinity for water and is a more efficient desiccant than silica gel the reaction of quicklime with water is associated with an increase in volume by a factor of at least 2.5 8 usage edit play media a demonstration of slaking of quicklime as a strongly exothermic reaction drops of water are added to pieces of quicklime after a while a pronounced exothermic reaction occurs slaking of lime the temperature can reach up to some 300 the major use of quicklime is in the basic oxygen steelmaking bos process its usage varies from about 30 50 kg t of steel the quicklime neutralizes the acidic oxides sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 to produce a basic molten slag 8 ground quicklime is used in the production of aerated concrete blocks with densities of ca 0.6 1.0 g cm 8 quicklime and hydrated lime can considerably increase the load carrying capacity of clay-containing soils they do this by reacting with finely divided silica and alumina to produce calcium silicates and aluminates which possess cementing properties 8 small quantities of quicklime are used in other processes e g the production of glass calcium aluminate cement and organic chemicals 8 heat quicklime releases thermal energy by the formation of the hydrate calcium hydroxide by the following equation 9 cao s h 2o l ca oh 2 aq h r 63.7 kj mol of cao as it hydrates an exothermic reaction results and the solid puffs up the hydrate can be reconverted to quicklime by removing the water by heating it to redness to reverse the hydration reaction one litre of water combines with approximately 3.1 kilograms 6.8 lb of quicklime to give calcium hydroxide plus 3.54 mj of energy this process can be used to provide a convenient portable source of heat as for on-the-spot food warming in a self-heating can cooking and heating water without open flames several companies sell cooking kits using this heating method 10 light when quicklime is heated to 2,400 c 4,350 f it emits an intense glow this form of illumination is known as a limelight and was used broadly in theatrical productions prior to the invention of electric lighting 11 cement calcium oxide is a key ingredient for the process of making cement as a cheap and widely available alkali about 50 of the total quicklime production is converted to calcium hydroxide before use both quick- and hydrated lime are used in the treatment of drinking water 8 petroleum industry water detection pastes contain a mix of calcium oxide and phenolphthalein should this paste come into contact with water in a fuel storage tank the cao reacts with the water to form calcium hydroxide calcium hydroxide has a high enough ph to turn the phenolphthalein a vivid purplish-pink color thus indicating the presence of water paper calcium oxide is used to regenerate sodium hydroxide from sodium carbonate in the chemical recovery at kraft pulp mills plaster there is archeological evidence that pre-pottery neolithic b humans used limestone-based plaster for flooring and other uses 12 13 14 such lime-ash floor remained in use until the late nineteenth century chemical or power production solid sprays or slurries of calcium oxide can be used to remove sulfur dioxide from exhaust streams in a process called flue-gas desulfurization as a weapon edit in 80 bc the roman general sertorius deployed choking clouds of caustic lime powder to defeat the characitani of hispania who had taken refuge in inaccessible caves a similar dust was used in china to quell an armed peasant revolt in 178 ad when lime chariots equipped with bellows blew limestone powder into the crowds 15 david hume in his history of england recounts that early in the reign of henry iii the english navy destroyed an invading french fleet by blinding the enemy fleet with quicklime 16 quicklime may have been used in medieval naval warfare - up to the use of lime-mortars to throw it at the enemy ships 17 quicklime is also thought to have been a component of greek fire upon contact with water quicklime would increase its temperature above 150 c and ignite the fuel 18 safety edit because of vigorous reaction of quicklime with water quicklime causes severe irritation when inhaled or placed in contact with moist skin or eyes inhalation may cause coughing sneezing labored breathing it may then evolve into burns with perforation of the nasal septum abdominal pain nausea and vomiting although quicklime is not considered a fire hazard its reaction with water can release enough heat to ignite combustible materials 19 references edit a b haynes william m ed 2011 crc handbook of chemistry and physics 92nd ed boca raton fl crc press p 4.55 isbn 1439855110 2013-12-30 at the wayback
