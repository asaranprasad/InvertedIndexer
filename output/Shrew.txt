shrew scientific classification kingdom animalia phylum chordata class mammalia infraclass eutheria order eulipotyphla family soricidae g fischer 1814 subfamilies crocidurinae myosoricinae soricinae a shrew or shrew mouse family soricidae is a small mole-like mammal classified in the order eulipotyphla true shrews are not to be confused with west indies shrews treeshrews otter shrews or elephant shrews which belong to different families or orders although its external appearance is generally that of a long-nosed mouse a shrew is not a rodent as mice are it is in fact a much closer relative of hedgehogs and moles and related to rodents only in that both belong to the boreoeutheria magnorder along with humans monkeys cats dogs horses rhinos cows pigs whales bats and others shrews have sharp spike-like teeth not the familiar gnawing front incisor teeth of rodents shrews are distributed almost worldwide of the major tropical and temperate land masses only new guinea australia and new zealand do not have any native shrews in south america shrews are relatively recent immigrants and are present only in the northern andes in terms of species diversity the shrew family is the fourth most successful mammal family being rivalled only by the muroid rodent families muridae and cricetidae and the bat family vespertilionidae contents 1 characteristics 1.1 echolocation 2 classification 3 references 4 further reading 5 external links characteristics edit all shrews are comparatively small most no larger than a mouse the largest species is the asian house shrew suncus murinus of tropical asia which is about 15 cm long and weighs around 100 g 2 several are very small notably the etruscan shrew suncus etruscus which at about 3.5 cm 1.4 in and 1.8 g 0.063 oz is the smallest living terrestrial mammal water shrew skeleton in general shrews are terrestrial creatures that forage for seeds insects nuts worms and a variety of other foods in leaf litter and dense vegetation but some specialise in climbing trees living underground living under snow or even hunting in water they have small eyes and generally poor vision but have excellent senses of hearing and smell 3 they are very active animals with voracious appetites shrews have unusually high metabolic rates above that expected in comparable small mammals 4 shrews in captivity can eat 1 2 to 2 times their own body weight in food daily 5 they do not hibernate but are capable of entering torpor in winter many species undergo morphological changes that drastically reduce their body weight shrews can lose between 30 and 50 of their body weight shrinking the size of bones skull and internal organs 6 whereas rodents have gnawing incisors that grow throughout life the teeth of shrews wear down throughout life a problem made more extreme because they lose their milk teeth before birth so have only one set of teeth throughout their lifetimes apart from the first pair of incisors which are long and sharp and the chewing molars at the back of the mouth the teeth of shrews are small and peg-like and may be reduced in number the dental formula of shrews is 3.1.1-3.31-2.0-1.1.3 shrews are fiercely territorial driving off rivals and only coming together to mate many species dig burrows for caching food and hiding from predators although this is not universal 3 female shrews can have up to 10 litters a year in the tropics they breed all year round in temperate zones they only stop breeding in the winter shrews have gestation periods of 17 32 days the female often becomes pregnant within a day or so of giving birth and lactates during her pregnancy weaning one litter as the next is born 3 shrews live 12 to 30 months 7 shrews are unusual among mammals in a number of respects unlike most mammals some species of shrews are venomous shrew venom is not conducted into the wound by fangs but by grooves in the teeth the venom contains various compounds and the contents of the venom glands of the american short-tailed shrew are sufficient to kill 200 mice by intravenous injection one chemical extracted from shrew venom may be potentially useful in the treatment of high blood pressure while another compound may be useful in the treatment of some neuromuscular diseases and migraines 8 the saliva of the northern short-tailed shrew blarina brevicauda contains soricidin a peptide which has been studied for use in treating ovarian cancer 9 also along with the bats and toothed whales some species of shrews use echolocation unlike most other mammals shrews lack zygomatic bones also called the jugals so have incomplete zygomatic arches echolocation edit the northern short-tailed shrew is known to echolocate the only terrestrial mammals known to echolocate are two genera sorex and blarina of shrews the tenrecs of madagascar rats and the solenodons citation needed these include the eurasian or common shrew sorex araneus and the american vagrant shrew sorex vagrans and northern short-tailed shrew blarina brevicauda these shrews emit series of ultrasonic squeaks 10 11 by nature the shrew sounds unlike those of bats are low-amplitude broadband multiharmonic and frequency modulated 11 they contain no echolocation clicks with reverberations and would seem to be used for simple close-range spatial orientation in contrast to bats shrews use echolocation only to investigate their habitats rather than additionally to pinpoint food 11 except for large and thus strongly reflecting objects such as a big stone or tree trunk they probably are not able to disentangle echo scenes but rather derive information on habitat type from the overall call reverberations this might be comparable to human hearing whether one calls into a beech forest or into a reverberant wine cellar 11 classification edit the 385 shrew species are in 26 genera 12 which are grouped into three living subfamilies crocidurinae white-toothed shrews myosoricinae african shrews and soricinae red-toothed shrews in addition the family contains the extinct subfamilies limnoecinae crocidosoricinae allosoricinae and heterosoricinae although heterosoricinae is also commonly considered a separate family family soricidae subfamily crocidurinae crocidura diplomesodon feroculus paracrocidura ruwenzorisorex scutisorex solisorex suncus sylvisorex subfamily myosoricinae
