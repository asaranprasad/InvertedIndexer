with magma rising from the mantle in red in geology the places known as hotspots or hot spots are volcanic regions thought to be fed by underlying mantle that is anomalously hot compared with the surrounding mantle their position on the earth s surface is independent of tectonic plate boundaries there are two hypotheses that attempt to explain their origins one suggests that hotspots are due to mantle plumes that rise as thermal diapirs from the core mantle boundary 1 the other hypothesis is that lithospheric extension permits the passive rising of melt from shallow depths 2 3 this hypothesis considers the term hotspot to be a misnomer asserting that the mantle source beneath them is in fact not anomalously hot at all well known examples include hawaii iceland and yellowstone

6 see also 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links origin edit schematic diagram showing the physical processes inside the earth that lead to the generation of magma partial melting begins above the fusion point the origins of the concept of hotspots lie in the work of j tuzo wilson who postulated in 1963 that the formation of the hawaiian islands resulted from the slow movement of a tectonic plate across a hot region beneath the surface 4 it was later postulated that hotspots are fed by narrow streams of hot mantle rising from the earth s core mantle boundary in a structure called a mantle plume 5 whether or not such mantle plumes exist is the subject of a major controversy in earth science 3 6 estimates for the number of hotspots postulated to be fed by mantle plumes has ranged from about 20 to several thousands over the years with most geologists considering a few tens to exist hawaii r union yellowstone gal pagos and iceland are some of the most active volcanic regions to which the hypothesis is applied composition edit most hotspot volcanoes are basaltic e g hawaii tahiti as a result they are less explosive than subduction zone volcanoes in which water is trapped under the overriding plate where hotspots occur in continental regions basaltic magma rises through the continental crust which melts to form rhyolites these rhyolites can form violent eruptions 7 8 for example the yellowstone caldera was formed by some of the most powerful volcanic explosions in geologic history however when the rhyolite is completely erupted it may be followed by eruptions of basaltic magma rising through the same lithospheric fissures cracks in the lithosphere an example of this activity is the ilgachuz range in british columbia which was created by an early complex series of trachyte and rhyolite eruptions and late extrusion of a sequence of basaltic lava flows 9 the hotspot hypothesis is now closely linked to the mantle plume hypothesis 10 comparison with island arc volcanoes edit hotspot volcanoes are considered to have a fundamentally different origin from island arc volcanoes the latter form over subduction zones at converging plate boundaries when one oceanic plate meets another the denser plate is forced downward into a deep ocean trench this plate as it is subducted releases water into the base of the over-riding plate and this water mixes with the rock thus changing its composition causing some rock to melt and rise it is this that fuels a chain of volcanoes such as the aleutian islands near alaska hotspot volcanic chains edit over millions of years the pacific plate has moved over the hawaii hotspot creating a trail of underwater mountains that stretch across the pacific kilauea is the most active shield volcano in the world the volcano has erupted nonstop since 1983 and it is part of the hawaiian emperor seamount chain mauna loa is a large shield volcano its last eruption was in 1984 and it is part of the hawaiian emperor seamount chain bowie seamount is a dormant submarine volcano and it is part of the kodiak-bowie seamount chain axial seamount is the youngest seamount of the cobb eickelberg seamount chain its last eruption was on 6 april 2011 11 mauna kea is the tallest volcano in the hawaiian emperor seamount chain it is dormant and it has cinder cones growing on the volcano hualalai is a massive shield volcano in the hawaiian emperor seamount chain its last eruption was in 1801 the joint mantle plume hotspot hypothesis envisages the feeder structures to be fixed relative to one another with the continents and seafloor drifting overhead the hypothesis thus predicts that time-progressive chains of volcanoes are developed on the surface examples are yellowstone which lies at the end of a chain of extinct calderas which become progressively older to the west another example is the hawaiian archipelago where islands become progressively older and more deeply eroded to the northwest geologists have tried to use hotspot volcanic chains to track the movement of the earth s tectonic plates this effort has been vexed by the lack of very long chains by the fact that many are not time-progressive e g the gal pagos and by the fact that hotspots do not appear to be fixed relative to one another e g hawaii and iceland 12 postulated hotspot volcano chains edit an example of mantle plume locations
