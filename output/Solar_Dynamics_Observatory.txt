scientists uncover new secrets about the sun the solar dynamics observatory sdo is a nasa mission which has been observing the sun since 2010 4 launched on february 11 2010 the observatory is part of the living with a star lws program 5 the goal of the lws program is to develop the scientific understanding necessary to effectively address those aspects of the connected sun earth system directly affecting life and society the goal of the sdo is to understand the influence of the sun on the earth and near-earth space by studying the solar atmosphere on small scales of space and time and in many wavelengths simultaneously sdo has been investigating how the sun s magnetic field is generated and structured how this stored magnetic energy is converted and released into the heliosphere and geospace in the form of solar wind energetic particles and variations in the solar irradiance 6 contents 1 general 1.1 helioseismic and magnetic imager hmi 1.2 extreme ultraviolet variability

general edit play media this visualization covers the same time span of 17 hours over the full wavelength range of the sdo the sdo spacecraft was developed at nasa s goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland and launched on february 11 2010 from cape canaveral air force station the primary mission is scheduled to last five years and three months with expendables expected to last for ten years 7 some consider sdo to be a follow-on mission to the solar and heliospheric observatory soho 8 sdo is a 3-axis stabilized spacecraft with two solar arrays and two high-gain antennas in an inclined geosynchronous orbit around earth the spacecraft includes three instruments the extreme ultraviolet variability experiment eve built in partnership with the university of colorado at boulder s laboratory for atmospheric and space physics lasp the helioseismic and magnetic imager hmi built in partnership with stanford university and the atmospheric imaging assembly aia built in partnership with the lockheed martin solar astrophysics laboratory data which is collected by the craft is made available as soon as possible after it is received 9 helioseismic and magnetic imager hmi edit the helioseismic and magnetic imager hmi led from stanford university in stanford california studies solar variability and characterizes the sun s interior and the various components of magnetic activity hmi produces data to determine the interior sources and mechanisms of solar variability and how the physical processes inside the sun are related to surface magnetic field and activity it also produces data to enable estimates of the coronal magnetic field for studies of variability in the extended solar atmosphere hmi observations will enable establishing the relationships between the internal dynamics and magnetic activity in order to understand solar variability and its effects 10 hmi will take high-resolution measurements of the longitudinal and vector magnetic field over the entire visible solar disk thus extending the capabilities of the soho s mdi instrument 11 extreme ultraviolet variability experiment eve edit the extreme ultraviolet variability experiment eve measures the sun s extreme ultraviolet irradiance with improved spectral resolution temporal cadence accuracy and precision over preceding measurements made by timed see soho and sorce xps the instrument incorporates physics-based models in order to further scientific understanding of the relationship between solar euv variations and magnetic variation changes in the sun 12 the sun s output of energetic extreme ultraviolet photons is primarily what heats the earth s upper atmosphere and creates the ionosphere solar euv radiation output undergoes constant changes both moment to moment and over the sun s 11-year solar cycle and these changes are important to understand because they have a significant impact on atmospheric heating satellite drag and communications system degradation including disruption of the global positioning system 13 the eve instrument package was built by the university of colorado at boulder s laboratory for atmospheric and space physics with dr tom woods as principal investigator 7 and was delivered to goddard space flight center on september 7 2007 14 the instrument provides improvements of up to 70 percent in spectral resolution measurements in the wavelengths below 30 nm and a 30 percent improvement in time cadence by taking measurements every 10 seconds over a 100 percent duty cycle 13 atmospheric imaging assembly aia edit the atmospheric imaging assembly aia led from the lockheed martin solar and astrophysics laboratory lmsal provides continuous full-disk observations of the solar chromosphere and corona in seven extreme ultraviolet euv channels spanning a temperature range from approximately 20,000 kelvin to in excess of 20 million kelvin the 12-second cadence of the image stream with 4096 by 4096 pixel images at 0.6 arcsec pixel provides unprecedented views of the various phenomena that occur within the evolving solar outer atmosphere the aia science investigation is led by lmsal which also operates the instrument and jointly with stanford university runs the joint science operations center from which all of the data are served to the worldwide scientific community as well as the general public lmsal designed the overall instrumentation and led its development and integration the four telescopes providing the individual light feeds for the instrument were designed and built at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory sao 15 since beginning its operational phase on 2010 05 01 aia has operated successfully with unprecedented euv image quality aia wavelength channel source 16 region of solar atmosphere
