is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid which is nearly colorless apart from a hint of blue it is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the universal solvent for its ability to dissolve many substances 16 17 this allows it to be the solvent of life 18 it is the most abundant substance on earth 19 and the only common substance to exist as a solid liquid and gas on earth s surface 20 it is also the third most abundant molecule in the universe 19 water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other and are strongly polar this polarity allows it to separate ions in salts and strongly bond to other polar substances such as alcohols and acids thus dissolving them its hydrogen bonding causes its many unique properties such as having a solid form less dense than its liquid form a relatively high boiling point of 100 c for its molar mass and a high heat capacity water is amphoteric meaning it is both an acid and a base it produces h and oh ions by self ionization c this means the product of the concentrations of h and oh has to be a constant because water is a very good solvent it is rarely pure and some of the properties of impure water can vary from those of the pure substance there are also many compounds that are essentially if not completely insoluble in water such as fats oils and other non-polar substances contents 1 nomenclature 2

references 11.1 notes 11.2 bibliography 12 external links nomenclature edit the accepted iupac name of water is oxidane or simply water 21 or its equivalent in different languages although there are other systematic names which can be used to describe the molecule oxidane is only intended to be used as the name of the mononuclear parent hydride used for naming derivatives of water by substituent nomenclature 22 these derivatives commonly have other recommended names for example the name hydroxyl is recommended over oxidanyl for the oh group the name oxane is explicitly mentioned by the iupac as being unsuitable for this purpose since it is already the name of a cyclic ether also known as tetrahydropyran 23 24 the simplest systematic name of water is hydrogen oxide this is analogous to related compounds such as hydrogen peroxide hydrogen sulfide and deuterium oxide heavy water using chemical nomenclature for type i ionic binary compounds water would take the name hydrogen monoxide 25 but this is not among the names published by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac 21 another name is dihydrogen monoxide which is a rarely used name of water and mostly used in the dihydrogen monoxide hoax other systematic names for water include hydroxic acid hydroxylic acid and hydrogen hydroxide using acid and base names d none of these exotic names are used widely the polarized form of the water molecule h oh is also called hydron hydroxide by iupac nomenclature 26 physical properties edit water is the chemical substance with chemical formula h 2o one molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to a single oxygen atom 27 water is a tasteless odorless liquid at ambient temperature and pressure and appears colorless in small quantities although it has its own intrinsic very light blue hue 28 2 ice also appears colorless and water vapor is essentially invisible as a gas unlike other analogous hydrides of the oxygen family water is primarily a liquid under standard conditions due to hydrogen bonding the molecules of water are constantly moving in relation to each other and the hydrogen bonds are continually breaking and reforming at timescales faster than 200 femtoseconds 2 10 13 seconds 29 however these bonds are strong enough to create many of the peculiar properties of water some of which make it integral to life water ice and vapor edit within the earth s atmosphere and surface the liquid phase is the most common and is the form that is generally denoted by the word water the solid phase of water is known as ice and commonly takes the structure of hard amalgamated crystals such as ice cubes or loosely accumulated granular crystals like snow there are other crystalline and amorphous phases of ice than the common hexagonal crystalline ice the gaseous phase of water is known as water vapor or steam visible steam and clouds are formed from minute droplets of water suspended in the air water also forms a supercritical fluid the critical temperature is 647 k and the critical pressure is 22.064 mpa in nature this only rarely occurs in extremely hostile conditions a likely example of naturally occurring supercritical water is in the hottest parts of deep water hydrothermal vents in which water is heated to the critical temperature by volcanic plumes and the critical pressure is caused by the weight of the ocean at the extreme depths where the vents are located this pressure is reached at a depth of about 2200 meters much less than the mean depth of the ocean 3800 meters 30 heat capacity and heats of vaporization and fusion edit heat of vaporization of water from melting to critical temperature water has a very high specific heat capacity of 4.1814 j g k at 25 c the second highest among all the heteroatomic species after ammonia as well as a high heat of vaporization 40.65 kj mol or 2257 kj kg at the normal boiling point both of which are a result of the extensive hydrogen bonding between its molecules these two unusual properties allow water to moderate earth s climate by buffering large fluctuations in temperature most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has accumulated in the oceans 31 the specific enthalpy of fusion more commonly known as latent heat of water is 333.55 kj kg at 0 c the same amount of energy is required to melt ice as to warm ice from 160 c up to its melting point or to heat the same amount of water by about 80 c of common substances only that of ammonia is higher this property confers resistance to melting on the ice of glaciers and drift ice before and since the advent of mechanical refrigeration ice was and still is in common use for retarding food spoilage the specific heat capacity of ice at 10 c is 2.03 j g k 32 and the heat capacity of steam at 100 c is 2.08 j g k 33 density of water and ice edit density of ice and water as a function of temperature the density of water is about 1 gram per cubic centimetre 62 lb cu ft this relationship was originally used to define the gram 34 the density varies with temperature but not linearly as the temperature increases the density rises to a peak at 3.98 c 39.16 f and then decreases 35 this unusual negative thermal expansion below 4 c 39 f is also observed in molten silica 36 regular hexagonal ice is also less dense than liquid water upon freezing the density of water decreases by about 9 37 these effects are due to the reduction of thermal motion with cooling which allows water molecules to form more hydrogen bonds that prevent the molecules from coming close to each other 35 while below 4 c the breakage of hydrogen bonds due to heating allows water molecules to pack closer despite the increase in the thermal motion which tends to expand a liquid above 4 c water expands as the temperature increases 35 water near the boiling point is about 4 less dense than water at 4 c 39 f 37 e under increasing pressure ice undergoes a number of transitions to other polymorphs with higher density than liquid water such as ice ii ice iii high-density amorphous ice hda and very-high-density amorphous ice vhda 38 39 temperature distribution in a lake in summer and winter the unusual density curve and lower density of ice than of water is vital to life if water were most dense at the freezing point then in winter the very cold water at the surface of lakes and other water bodies would sink the lake could freeze from the bottom up and all life in them would be killed 37 furthermore given that water is a good thermal insulator due to its heat capacity some frozen lakes might not completely thaw in summer 37 the layer of ice that floats on top insulates the water below 40 water at about 4 c 39 f also sinks to the bottom thus keeping the temperature of the water at the bottom constant see diagram 37 density of saltwater and ice edit woa surface density the density of salt water depends on the dissolved salt content as well as the temperature ice still floats in the oceans otherwise they would freeze from the bottom up however the salt content of oceans lowers the freezing point by about 1.9 c 41 see here for explanation and lowers the temperature of the density maximum of water to the former freezing point at 0 c this is why in ocean water the downward convection of colder water is not blocked by an expansion of water as it becomes colder near the freezing point the oceans cold water near the freezing point continues to sink so creatures that live at the bottom of cold oceans like the arctic ocean generally live in water 4 c colder than at the bottom of frozen-over fresh water lakes and rivers as the surface of salt water begins to freeze at 1.9 c 41 for normal salinity seawater 3.5 the ice that forms is essentially salt-free with about the same density as freshwater ice this ice floats on the surface and the salt that is frozen out adds to the salinity and density of the sea water just below it in a process known as brine rejection this denser salt water sinks by convection and the replacing seawater is subject to the same process this produces essentially freshwater ice at 1.9 c 41 on the surface the increased density of the sea water beneath the forming ice causes it to sink towards the bottom on a large scale the process of brine rejection and sinking cold salty water results in ocean currents forming to transport such water away from the poles leading to a global system of currents called the thermohaline circulation miscibility and condensation edit red line shows saturation water is miscible with many liquids including ethanol in all proportions water and most oils are immiscible usually forming layers according to increasing density from the top this can be predicted by comparing the polarity water being a relatively polar compound will tend to be miscible with liquids of high polarity such as ethanol and acetone whereas compounds with low polarity will tend to be immiscible and poorly soluble such as with hydrocarbons as a gas water vapor is completely miscible with air on the other hand the maximum water vapor pressure that is thermodynamically stable with the liquid or solid at a given temperature is relatively low compared with total atmospheric pressure for example if the vapor s partial pressure is 2 of atmospheric pressure and the air is cooled from 25 c starting at about 22 c water will start to condense defining the dew point and creating fog or dew the reverse process accounts for the fog burning of in the morning if the humidity is increased at room temperature for example by running a hot shower or a bath and the temperature stays about the same the vapor soon reaches the pressure for phase change and then condenses out as minute water droplets commonly referred to as steam a saturated gas or one with 100 relative humidity is when the vapor pressure of water in the air is at equilibrium with vapor pressure due to liquid water water or ice if cool enough will fail to lose mass through evaporation when exposed to saturated air because the amount of water vapor in air is small relative humidity the ratio of the partial pressure due to the water vapor to the saturated partial vapor pressure is much more useful vapor pressure above 100 relative humidity is called super-saturated and can occur if air is rapidly cooled for example by rising suddenly in an updraft f vapor pressure edit vapor pressure diagrams of water compressibility edit the compressibility of water is a function of pressure and temperature at 0 c at the limit of zero pressure the compressibility is 6990510000000000000 5.1 10 10 pa 1 at the zero-pressure limit the compressibility reaches a minimum of 6990440000000000000 4.4 10 10 pa 1 around 45 c before increasing again with increasing temperature as the pressure is increased the compressibility decreases being 6990390000000000000 3.9 10 10 pa 1 at 0 c and 100 megapascals 1,000 bar 42 the bulk modulus of water is about 2.2 gpa 43 the low compressibility of non-gases and of water in particular leads to their often being assumed as incompressible the low compressibility of water means that even in the deep oceans at 4 km depth where pressures are 40 mpa there is only a 1.8 decrease in volume 43 triple point edit the various triple points of water phases in stable equilibrium pressure temperature liquid water ice ih and water vapor 611.657 pa 44 273.16 k 0.01 c liquid water ice ih and ice iii 209.9 mpa 251 k 22 c liquid water ice iii and ice v 350.1 mpa 17.0 c liquid water ice v and ice vi 632.4 mpa 0.16 c ice ih ice ii and ice iii 213 mpa 35 c ice ii ice iii and ice v 344 mpa 24 c ice ii ice v and ice vi 626 mpa 70 c the temperature and pressure at which solid liquid and gaseous water coexist in equilibrium is called the triple point of water this point is used to define the units of temperature the kelvin the si unit of thermodynamic temperature and indirectly the degree celsius and even the degree fahrenheit as a consequence water s triple point temperature as measured in these units is a prescribed value rather than a measured quantity phase diagram of water this pressure is quite low about 1 166 of the normal sea level barometric pressure of 101,325 pa the atmospheric surface pressure on planet mars is 610.5 pa which is remarkably close to the triple point pressure the altitude of this surface pressure was used to define zero-elevation or sea level on that planet 45 although it is commonly named as the triple point of water the stable combination of liquid water ice i and water vapor is but one of several triple points on the phase diagram of water gustav heinrich johann apollon tammann in g ttingen produced data on several other triple points in the early 20th century kamb and others documented further triple points in the 1960s 46 47 48 melting point edit the melting point of ice is 0 c 32 f 273 k at standard pressure however pure liquid water can be supercooled well below that temperature without freezing if the liquid is not mechanically disturbed it can remain in a fluid state down to its homogeneous nucleation point of about 231 k 42 c 44 f 49 the melting point of ordinary hexagonal ice falls slightly under moderately high pressures by 0.0073 c 0.0131 f atm g or about 0.5 c 0.90 f 70 atm h 50 as the stabilization energy of hydrogen bonding is exceeded by intermolecular repulsion but as ice transforms into its allotropes see crystalline states of ice above 209.9 mpa 2,072 atm the melting point increases markedly with pressure i e reaching 355 k 82 c at 2.216 gpa 21,870 atm triple point of ice vii 51 electrical properties edit electrical conductivity edit pure water containing no exogenous ions is an excellent insulator but not even deionized water is completely free of ions water undergoes auto-ionization in the liquid state when two water molecules form one hydroxide anion oh and one hydronium cation h 3o because water is such a good solvent it almost always has some solute dissolved in it often a salt if water has even a tiny amount of such an impurity then it can conduct electricity far more readily it is known that the theoretical maximum electrical resistivity for water is approximately 18.2 m cm 182 k m at 25 c 52 this figure agrees well with what is typically seen on reverse osmosis ultra-filtered and deionized ultra-pure water systems used for instance in semiconductor manufacturing plants a salt or acid contaminant level exceeding even 100 parts per trillion ppt in otherwise ultra-pure water begins to noticeably lower its resistivity by up to several k m citation needed in pure water sensitive equipment can detect a very slight electrical conductivity of 0.05501 0.0001 s cm at 25.00 c 52 water can also be electrolyzed into oxygen and hydrogen gases but in the absence of dissolved ions this is a very slow process as very little current is conducted in ice the primary charge carriers are protons see proton conductor 53 ice was previously thought to have a small but measurable conductivity of 1 10 10 s cm but this conductivity is now thought to be almost entirely from surface defects and without those ice is an insulator with an immeasurably small conductivity 35 polarity and hydrogen bonding edit a diagram showing the partial charges on the atoms in a water molecule an important feature of water is its polar nature the structure has a bent molecular geometry for the two hydrogens from the oxygen vertex the oxygen atom also has two lone pairs of electrons one effect usually ascribed to the lone pairs is that the h o h gas phase bend angle is 104.48 54 which is smaller than the typical tetrahedral angle of 109.47 the lone pairs are closer to the oxygen atom than the electrons sigma bonded to the hydrogens so they require more space the increased repulsion of the lone pairs forces the o h bonds closer to each other 55 another effect of the electronic structure is that water is a polar molecule due to the difference in electronegativity there is a bond dipole moment pointing from each h to the o making the oxygen partially negative and each hydrogen partially positive in addition the lone pairs of electrons on the o are in the direction opposite to the hydrogen atoms this results in a large molecular dipole pointing from a positive region between the two hydrogen atoms to the negative region of the oxygen atom the charge differences cause water molecules to be attracted to each other the relatively positive areas being attracted to the relatively negative areas and to other polar molecules this attraction contributes to hydrogen bonding and explains many of the properties of water such as solvent action 56 although hydrogen bonding is a relatively weak attraction compared to the covalent bonds within the water molecule itself it is responsible for a number of water s physical properties these properties include its relatively high melting and boiling point temperatures more energy is required to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules in contrast hydrogen sulfide h 2s has much weaker hydrogen bonding due to sulfur s lower electronegativity h 2s is a gas at room temperature in spite of hydrogen sulfide having nearly twice the molar mass of water the extra bonding between water molecules also gives liquid water a large specific heat capacity this high heat capacity makes water a good heat storage medium coolant and heat shield cohesion and adhesion edit dew drops adhering to a spider web water molecules stay close to each other cohesion due to the collective action of hydrogen bonds between water molecules these hydrogen bonds are constantly breaking with new bonds being formed with different water molecules but at any given time in a sample of liquid water a large portion of the molecules are held together by such bonds 57 water also has high adhesion properties because of its polar nature on extremely clean smooth glass the water may form a thin film because the molecular forces between glass and water molecules adhesive forces are stronger than the cohesive forces in biological cells and organelles water is in contact with membrane and protein surfaces that are hydrophilic that is surfaces that have a strong attraction to water irving langmuir observed a strong repulsive force between hydrophilic surfaces to dehydrate hydrophilic surfaces to remove the strongly held layers of water of hydration requires doing substantial work against these forces called hydration forces these forces are very large but decrease rapidly over a nanometer or less 58 they are important in biology particularly when cells are dehydrated by exposure to dry atmospheres or to extracellular freezing 59 surface tension edit this paper clip is under the water level which has risen gently and smoothly surface tension prevents the clip from submerging and the water from overflowing the glass edges temperature dependence of the surface tension of pure water water has an unusually high surface tension of 71.99 mn m at 25 c 60 which is caused by the strength of the hydrogen bonding between water molecules 61 this allows insects to walk on water 61 capillary action edit because water has strong cohesive and adhesive forces it exhibits capillary action 62 strong cohesion from hydrogen bonding and adhesion allows trees to transport water more than 100 m upward 61 water as a solvent edit presence of colloidal calcium carbonate from high concentrations of dissolved lime turns the water of havasu falls turquoise water is an excellent solvent due to its high dielectric constant 63 substances that mix well and dissolve in water are known as hydrophilic water-loving substances while those that do not mix well with water are known as hydrophobic water-fearing substances 64 the ability of a substance to dissolve in water is determined by whether or not the substance can match or better the strong attractive forces that water molecules generate between other water molecules if a substance has properties that do not allow it to overcome these strong intermolecular forces the molecules are precipitated out from the water contrary to the common misconception water and hydrophobic substances do not repel and the hydration of a hydrophobic surface is energetically but not entropically favorable when an ionic or polar compound enters water it is surrounded by water molecules hydration the relatively small size of water molecules 3 angstroms allows many water molecules to surround one molecule of solute the partially negative dipole ends of the water are attracted to positively charged components of the solute and vice versa for the positive dipole ends in general ionic and polar substances such as acids alcohols and salts are relatively soluble in water and non-polar substances such as fats and oils are not non-polar molecules stay together in water because it is energetically more favorable for the water molecules to hydrogen bond to each other than to engage in van der waals interactions with non-polar molecules an example of an ionic solute is table salt the sodium chloride nacl separates into na cations and cl anions each being surrounded by water molecules the ions are then easily transported away from their crystalline lattice into solution an example of a nonionic solute is table sugar the water dipoles make hydrogen bonds with the polar regions of the sugar molecule oh groups and allow it to be carried away into solution quantum tunneling edit the quantum tunneling dynamics in water was reported as early as 1992 at that time it was known that there are motions which destroy and regenerate the weak hydrogen bond by internal rotations of the substituent water monomers 65 on 18 march 2016 it was reported that the hydrogen bond can be broken by quantum tunneling in the water hexamer unlike previously reported tunneling motions in water this involved the concerted breaking of two hydrogen bonds 66 later in the same year the discovery of the quantum tunneling of water molecules was reported 67 electromagnetic absorption edit water is relatively transparent to visible light near ultraviolet light and far-red light but it absorbs most ultraviolet light infrared light and microwaves most photoreceptors and photosynthetic pigments utilize the portion of the light spectrum that is transmitted well through water microwave ovens take advantage of water s opacity to microwave radiation to heat the water inside of foods the very weak onset of absorption in the red end of the visible spectrum lends water its intrinsic blue hue see color of water structure edit model of hydrogen bonds 1 between molecules of water a single water molecule can participate in a maximum of four hydrogen bonds because it can accept two bonds using the lone pairs on oxygen and donate two hydrogen atoms other molecules like hydrogen fluoride ammonia and methanol can also form hydrogen bonds however they do not show anomalous thermodynamic kinetic or structural properties like those observed in water because none of them can form four hydrogen bonds either they cannot donate or accept hydrogen atoms or there are steric effects in bulky residues in water intermolecular tetrahedral structures form due to the four hydrogen bonds thereby forming an open structure and a three-dimensional bonding network resulting in the anomalous decrease in density when cooled below 4 c this repeated constantly reorganizing unit defines a three-dimensional network extending throughout the liquid this view is based upon neutron scattering studies and computer simulations and it makes sense in the light of the unambiguously tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules in ice structures however there is an alternative theory for the structure of water in 2004 a controversial paper from stockholm university suggested that water molecules in liquid form typically bind not to four but to only two others thus forming chains and rings the term string theory of water which is not to be confused with the string theory of physics was coined these observations were based upon x-ray absorption spectroscopy that probed the local environment of individual oxygen atoms 68 chemical properties edit at standard conditions water is a polar liquid that slightly dissociates disproportionately or self ionizes into an hydronium ion and hydroxide ion 2 h 2o h 3o oh the dissociation constant for this dissociation is commonly symbolized as kw and has a value of about 10 14 at 25 c see here for values at other temperatures pure water has a concentration of the hydroxide ion oh equal to that of the hydrogen ion h which gives a ph of 7 at 25 c 69 geochemistry edit action of water on rock over long periods of time typically leads to weathering and water erosion physical processes that convert solid rocks and minerals into soil and sediment but under some conditions chemical reactions with water occur as well resulting in metasomatism or mineral hydration a type of chemical alteration of a rock which produces clay minerals it also occurs when portland cement hardens water ice can form clathrate compounds known as clathrate hydrates with a variety of small molecules that can be embedded in its spacious crystal lattice the most notable of these is methane clathrate 4 ch 4 23h 2o naturally found in large quantities on the ocean floor acidity in nature edit rain is generally mildly acidic with a ph between 5.2 and 5.8 if not having any acid stronger than carbon dioxide 70 if high amounts of nitrogen and sulfur oxides are present in the air they too will dissolve into the cloud and rain drops producing acid rain isotopologues edit several isotopes of both hydrogen and oxygen exist giving rise to several known isotopologues of water vienna standard mean ocean water is the current international standard for water isotopes naturally occurring water is almost completely composed of the neutron-less hydrogen isotope protium only 155 ppm include deuterium 2 h or d a hydrogen isotope with one neutron and fewer than 20 parts per quintillion include tritium 3 h or t which has two neutrons oxygen also has three stable isotopes with 16 o present in 99.76 17 o in 0.04 and 18 o in 0.2 of water molecules 71 deuterium oxide d 2o is also known as heavy water because of its higher density it is used in nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator tritium is radioactive decaying with a half-life of 4500 days tho exists in nature only in minute quantities being produced primarily via cosmic ray-induced nuclear reactions in the atmosphere water with one protium and one deuterium atom hdo occurs naturally in ordinary water in low concentrations 0.03 and d 2o in far lower amounts 0.000003 and any such molecules are temporary as the atoms recombine the most notable physical differences between h 2o and d 2o other than the simple difference in specific mass involve properties that are affected by hydrogen bonding such as freezing and boiling and other kinetic effects this is because the nucleus of deuterium is twice as heavy as protium and this causes noticeable differences in bonding energies the difference in boiling points allows the isotopologues to be separated the self-diffusion coefficient of h 2o at 25 c is 23 higher than the value of d 2o 72 because water molecules exchange hydrogen atoms with one another hydrogen deuterium oxide doh is much more common in low-purity heavy water than pure dideuterium monoxide d 2o consumption of pure isolated d 2o may affect biochemical processes ingestion of large amounts impairs kidney and central nervous system function small quantities can be consumed without any ill-effects humans are generally unaware of taste differences 73 but sometimes report a burning sensation 74 or sweet flavor 75 very large amounts of heavy water must be consumed for any toxicity to become apparent rats however are able to avoid heavy water by smell and it is toxic to many animals 76 light water refers to deuterium-depleted water ddw water in which the deuterium content has been reduced below the standard 155 ppm level occurrence edit it is the most abundant substance on earth and also the third most abundant molecule in the universe after h 2 and co 19 0.23 ppm of the earth s mass is water and 97.39 of the global water volume of 1.38 109 km3 is found in the oceans 77 reactions edit acid-base reactions edit water is amphoteric it has the ability to act as either an acid or a base in chemical reactions 78 according to the br nsted-lowry definition an acid is a proton h donor and a base is a proton acceptor 79 when reacting with a stronger acid water acts as a base when reacting with a stronger base it acts as an acid 79 for instance water receives an h ion from hcl when hydrochloric acid is formed hcl acid h 2o base h 3o cl in the reaction with ammonia nh 3 water donates a h ion and is thus acting as an acid nh 3 base h 2o acid nh 4 oh because the oxygen atom in water has two lone pairs water often acts as a lewis base or electron pair donor in reactions with lewis acids although it can also react with lewis bases forming hydrogen bonds between the electron pair donors and the hydrogen atoms of water hsab theory describes water as both a weak hard acid and a weak hard base meaning that it reacts preferentially with other hard species h lewis acid h 2o lewis base 3 o fe3 lewis acid h 2o lewis base fe h 2o 3 6 cl lewis base h 2o lewis acid cl h 2o 6 when a salt of a weak acid or of a weak base is dissolved in water water can partially hydrolyze the salt producing the corresponding base or acid which gives aqueous solutions of soap and baking soda their basic ph na 2co 3 h 2o naoh nahco 3 ligand chemistry edit water s lewis base character makes it a common ligand in transition metal complexes examples of which range from solvated ions such as fe h 2o 3 6 to perrhenic acid which contains two water molecules coordinated to a rhenium atom and various solid hydrates such as cocl 2 6h 2o water is typically a monodentate ligand it forms only one bond with the central atom 80 organic chemistry edit as a hard base water reacts readily with organic carbocations for example in an hydration reaction a hydroxyl group oh and an acidic proton are added to the two carbon atoms bonded together in the carbon-carbon double bond resulting in an alcohol when addition of water to an organic molecule cleaves the molecule in two hydrolysis is said to occur notable examples of hydrolysis are the saponification of fats and the digestion of proteins and polysaccharides water can also be a leaving group in sn2 substitution and e2 elimination reactions the latter is then known as a dehydration reaction water in redox reactions edit water contains hydrogen in the oxidation state 1 and oxygen in the oxidation state 2 81 it oxidizes chemicals such as hydrides alkali metals and some alkaline earth metals 82 83 one example of an alkali metal reacting with water is 84 2 na 2 h 2o h 2 2 na 2 oh some other reactive metals such as aluminum and beryllium are oxidized by water as well but their oxides adhere to the metal and form a passive protective layer 85 note that the rusting of iron is a reaction between iron and oxygen 86 that is dissolved in water not between iron and water water can be oxidized to emit oxygen gas but very few oxidants react with water even if their reduction potential is greater than the potential of o 2 h 2o almost all such reactions require a catalyst 87 an example of the oxidation of water is 4 agf 2 2 h 2o 4 agf 4 hf o 2 electrolysis edit water can be split into its constituent elements hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it 88 this process is called electrolysis the cathode half reaction is 2 h 2 e h 2 the anode half reaction is 2 h 2o o 2 4 h 4 e the gases produced bubble to the surface where they can be collected the required potential for the electrolysis of pure water is 1.23 v at 25 c 88 the operating potential is actually 1.48 v or higher in practical electrolysis history edit henry cavendish showed that water was composed of oxygen and hydrogen in 1781 89 the first decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis was done in 1800 by english chemist william nicholson and anthony carlisle 89 90 in 1805 joseph louis gay-lussac and alexander von humboldt showed that water is composed of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen 91 gilbert newton lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water in 1933 92 the properties of water have historically been used to define various temperature scales notably the kelvin celsius rankine and fahrenheit scales were or currently are defined by the freezing and boiling points of water the less common scales of delisle newton r aumur and r mer were defined similarly the triple point of water is a more commonly used standard point today see also edit water data page dihydrogen monoxide hoax
