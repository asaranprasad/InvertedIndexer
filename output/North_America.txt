philadelphia north america is a continent entirely within the northern hemisphere and almost all within the western hemisphere it is also considered by some to be a northern subcontinent of the americas 3 4 it is bordered to the north by the arctic ocean to the east by the atlantic ocean to the west and south by the pacific ocean and to the southeast by south america and the caribbean sea north america covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers 9,540,000 square miles about 16.5 of the earth s land area and about 4.8 of its total surface north america is the third largest continent by area following asia and africa 5 and the fourth by population after asia africa and europe 6 in 2013 its population was estimated at nearly 565 million people in 23 independent states or about 7.5 of the world s population if nearby islands most notably the caribbean are included north america was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period via crossing the bering land bridge approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago the so-called paleo-indian period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago the beginning of the archaic or meso-indian period the classic stage spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries the pre-columbian era ended with the transatlantic migrations and the arrival of european settlers during the age of discovery and the early modern period present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect different kind of interactions between european colonists indigenous peoples african slaves and their descendants european influences are strongest in the northern parts of the continent while indigenous and african influences are relatively stronger in the south because of the history of colonialism most north americans speak english

having been named after the italian explorer amerigo vespucci by the german cartographers martin waldseem ller and matthias ringmann 7 vespucci who explored south america between 1497 and 1502 was the first european to suggest that the americas were not the east indies but a different landmass previously unknown by europeans in 1507 waldseem ller produced a world map in which he placed the word america on the continent of south america in the middle of what is today brazil he explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book cosmographiae introductio 8 ab americo inventore quasi americi terram sive americam from americus the discoverer as if it were the land of americus thus america for waldseem ller no one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer he used the latinized version of vespucci s name americus vespucius but in its feminine form america following the examples of europa asia and africa later other mapmakers extended the name america to the northern continent in 1538 gerard mercator used america on his map of the world for all the western hemisphere 9 some argue that the convention is to use the surname for naming discoveries except in the case of royalty and so a derivation from amerigo vespucci could be problematic 10 ricardo palma 1949 proposed a derivation from the amerrique mountains of central america vespucci was the first to discover south america and the amerrique mountains of central america which connected his discoveries to those of christopher columbus alfred e hudd proposed a theory in 1908 that the continents are named after a welsh merchant named richard amerike from bristol who is believed to have financed john cabot s voyage of discovery from england to newfoundland in 1497 a minutely explored belief that has been advanced is that america was named for a spanish sailor bearing the ancient visigothic name of amairick another is that the name is rooted in a native american language 9 extent the term north america maintains various definitions in accordance with location and context in canadian english north america may be used to refer to the united states and canada together 11 alternatively usage sometimes includes greenland 12 13 14 and mexico as in the north american free trade agreement 13 15 16 17 18 as well as offshore islands the un geoscheme for north america separates mexico from the united states and canada placing it instead within its designated central america region while also treating the islands of the caribbean separately from the us canada definition the un s north america definition still includes the canadian arctic archipelago and greenland together with the us canada continental definition with both insular entities being tectonically on the north american plate in france italy portugal spain romania greece and the countries of latin america the cognates of north america usually designate a subcontinent of the americas comprising canada the united states and mexico and often greenland saint pierre et miquelon and bermuda 19 20 21 22 23 north america has been historically referred to by other names spanish north america new spain was often referred to as northern america and this was the first official name given to mexico 24 regions geographically the north american continent has many regions and subregions these include cultural economic and geographic regions economic regions included those formed by trade blocs such as the north american trade agreement bloc and central american trade agreement linguistically and culturally the continent could be divided into anglo-america and latin america anglo-america includes most of northern america belize and caribbean islands with english-speaking populations though sub-national entities such as louisiana and quebec are francophone in composition the southern north american continent is composed of two regions these are central america and the caribbean 25 26 the north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well in contrast to the common definition of north america that which encompasses the whole continent the term north america is also used to refer to canada mexico the united states and greenland 12 13 14 15 27 the term northern america refers to the northern-most countries and territories of north america canada the united states greenland bermuda and st

mexico 30 the largest countries of the continent canada and the united states also contain well-defined and recognized regions in the case of canada these are the british columbia coast canadian prairies central canada atlantic canada and northern canada these regions also contain many subregions in the case of the united states and in accordance with the us census bureau definitions these regions are new england mid-atlantic east north central states west north central states south atlantic states east south central states west south central states mountain states and pacific states

north america it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the proterozoic eon 36 the canadian shield is the largest exposure of this craton from the late paleozoic to early mesozoic eras north america was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent pangaea with eurasia to its east one of the results of the formation of pangaea was the appalachian mountains which formed some 480 million years ago making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world when pangaea began to rift around 200 million years ago north america became part of laurasia before it separated from eurasia as its own continent during the mid-cretaceous period 37 the rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the laramide orogeny between 80 and 55 million years ago the formation of the isthmus of panama that connected the continent to south america arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 million years ago 38 and the great lakes as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago north america is the source of much of what humanity knows about geologic time periods 39 the geographic area that would later become the united states has been the source of more varieties of dinosaurs than any other modern country 39 according to paleontologist peter dodson this is primarily due to stratigraphy climate and geography human resources and history 39 much of the mesozoic era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent 39 the most significant late jurassic dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in north america is the morrison formation of the western united states 40 pre-columbian the el castillo pyramid at chich n itz mexico the indigenous peoples of north america have many creation myths by which they assert that they have been present on the land since its creation 41 the specifics of paleo-indian migration to and throughout the americas including the exact dates and routes traveled are subject to ongoing research and discussion 42 the traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the beringia land bridge between eastern siberia and present-day alaska around 25,000 to 11,000 years ago 43 the few agreements achieved to date are the origin from central asia with widespread habitation of the americas during the end of the last glacial period or more specifically what is known as the late glacial maximum around 13,000 years before present 44 some genetic research indicated secondary waves of migration occurred after the initial paleo-indian colonization 45 but prior to modern inuit inupiat and yupik expansions 46 before contact with europeans the natives of north america were divided into many different polities from small bands of a few families to large empires they lived in several culture areas which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones and give a good indication of the main lifeway or occupation of the people who lived there e g the bison hunters of the great plains or the farmers of mesoamerica native groups can also be classified by their language family e g athapascan or uto-aztecan peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture nor were they always allies anthropologists think that the inuit people of the high arctic came to north america much later than other native groups as evidenced by the disappearance of dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the thule people during the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent cultures changed and shifted one of the oldest cultures yet found is the clovis culture of modern new mexico later cultures include the mississippian culture and related mound building cultures found in the mississippi river valley and the pueblo culture of what is now the four corners the more southern cultural groups of north america were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world such as tomatoes and squash perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the world s major staples maize corn the earliest verifiable instance of pre-columbian trans-oceanic contact by any european culture with the landmasses that geologically constitute the mainland of modern north america has been dated to the end of the 10th century ce this site situated at the northernmost extent of the island named newfoundland is known as l anse aux meadows where unmistakable evidence of norse settlement was uncovered in the early 1960s 47 as a result of the development of agriculture in the south many important cultural advances were made there for example the maya civilization developed a writing system built huge pyramids and temples had a complex calendar and developed the concept of zero around 400 ce a few hundred years after the mesopotamians 48 the mayan culture was still present in southern mexico and guatemala when the spanish explorers arrived but political dominance in the area had shifted to the aztec empire whose capital city tenochtitlan was located further north in the valley of mexico the aztecs were conquered in 1521 by hern n cort s 49 colonial period benjamin west s the death of general wolfe 1771 depicting the battle of the plains of abraham during the age of discovery europeans explored and staked claims to various parts of north america upon their arrival in the new world the native american population declined substantially because of violent conflicts with the invaders and the introduction of european diseases to which the native americans lacked immunity 50 native culture changed drastically and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed several linguistic groups died out and others changed quite quickly the names and cultures that europeans recorded were not necessarily the same as the names they had used a few generations before or the ones in use today britain spain and france took over extensive territories in north america and fought over them in the late 18th century and beginning of the 19th independence movements that sprung up across the continent led to the creation of the modern countries in the area the 13 british colonies on the north atlantic coast declared independence in 1776 becoming the united states of america canada was formed from the unification of northern territories controlled by britain and france new spain a territory that stretched from modern-day southern us to central america declared independence in 1810 becoming the first mexican empire in 1823 the former captaincy general of guatemala then part of the mexican empire became the first independent state in central america officially changing its name to the united provinces of central america geography satellite imagery of north america north america occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the new world the western hemisphere the americas or simply america which less commonly is considered by some as a single continent 51 52 53 with north america a subcontinent 54 north america s only land connection to south america is at the isthmus of panama the continent is delimited on the southeast by most geographers at the dari n watershed along the colombia-panama border placing all of panama within north america 55 56 57 alternatively some geologists physiographically locate its southern limit at the isthmus of tehuantepec mexico with central america extending southeastward to south america from this point 58 the caribbean islands or west indies are considered part of north america 3 the continental coastline is long and irregular the gulf of mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent followed by hudson bay others include the gulf of saint lawrence and the gulf of california before the central american isthmus formed the region had been underwater the islands of the west indies delineate a submerged former land bridge which had connected north and south america via what are now florida and venezuela there are numerous islands off the continent s coasts principally the arctic archipelago the bahamas turks caicos the greater and lesser antilles the aleutian islands some of which are in the eastern hemisphere proper the alexander archipelago the many thousand islands of the british columbia coast and newfoundland greenland a self-governing danish island and the world s largest is on the same tectonic plate the north american plate and is part of north america geographically in a geologic sense bermuda is not part of the americas but an oceanic island which was formed on the fissure of the mid-atlantic ridge over 100 million years ago the nearest landmass to it is cape hatteras north carolina however bermuda is often thought of as part of north america especially given its historical political and cultural ties to virginia and other parts of the continent moraine lake in banff national park the vast majority of north america is on the north american plate parts of western mexico including baja california and of california including the cities of san diego los angeles and santa cruz lie on the eastern edge of the pacific plate with the two plates meeting along the san andreas fault the southernmost portion of the continent and much of the west indies lie on the caribbean plate whereas the juan de fuca and cocos plates border the north american plate on its western frontier the continent can be divided into four great regions each of which contains many subregions the great plains stretching from the gulf of mexico to the canadian arctic the geologically young mountainous west including the rocky mountains the great basin california and alaska the raised but relatively flat plateau of the canadian shield in the northeast and the varied eastern region which includes the appalachian mountains the coastal plain along the atlantic seaboard and the florida peninsula mexico with its long plateaus and cordilleras falls largely in the western region although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the gulf the western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the rockies and the coast ranges in california oregon washington and british columbia with the great basin a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts in between the highest peak is denali in alaska the states

one of the oldest regions in the world with more than half of the region consisting of precambrian rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the palaeozoic era 60 canada s mineral resources are diverse and extensive 60 across the canadian shield and in the north there are large iron nickel zinc copper gold lead molybdenum and uranium reserves large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the arctic 61 making canada one of the world s largest producers throughout the shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals the largest and best known is sudbury ontario sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the shield since there is significant evidence that the sudbury basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater the nearby but less known temagami magnetic anomaly has striking similarities to the sudbury basin its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the sudbury basin and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater 62 the shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry united states geology the lower 48 us states can be divided into roughly five

and the united states are the wealthiest and most developed nations in the continent followed by mexico a newly industrialized country 68 the countries of central america and the caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development for example small caribbean island-nations such as barbados trinidad and tobago and antigua and barbuda have a higher gdp ppp per capita than mexico due to their smaller populations panama and costa rica have a significantly higher human development index and gdp than the rest of the central american nations 69 additionally despite greenland s

economy is well defined and structured in three main economic areas 115 these areas are the north american free trade agreement nafta caribbean community and common market caricom and the central american common market cacm 115 of these trade blocs the united states takes part in two in addition to the larger trade blocs there is the canada-costa rica free trade agreement among numerous other free trade relations often between the larger more developed countries and central american and caribbean countries the north america free trade agreement nafta forms one of the four largest trade blocs in the world 116 its implementation in 1994 was designed for economic homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between canada the united states and mexico 117 while canada and the united states already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship and to present day still do in the world and canada united states trade relations already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs 118 nafta allowed mexico to experience a similar duty-free trade the free trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on united states-mexico trade trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010 surface trade between the three nafta nations reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3 or us 791 billion 119 the nafta trade bloc gdp ppp is the world s largest with us 17.617 trillion 120 this is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the united states is the world s largest national economy the country had a nominal gdp of approximately 14.7 trillion in 2010 121 the countries of nafta are also some of each other s largest trade partners the united states is the largest trade partner of canada and mexico 122 while canada and mexico are each other s third largest trade partners 123 124 the caribbean trade bloc caricom came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 caribbean nations as of 2000 caricom trade volume was us 96 billion caricom also allowed for the creation of a common passport for associated nations in the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on free trade agreements and under the caricom office of trade negotiations otn free trade agreements have been signed into effect integration of central american economies occurred under the signing of the central american common market agreement in 1961 this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation recent implementation of the central american free trade agreement cafta has left the future of the cacm unclear 125 the central american free trade agreement was signed by five central american countries the dominican republic and the united states the focal point of cafta is to create a free trade area similar to that of nafta in addition to the united states canada also has relations in central american trade blocs currently under proposal the canada central american free trade agreement ca4 would operate much the same as cafta with the united states does these nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs mexico takes a part in the g3 free trade agreement with colombia and venezuela and has a trade agreement with the eu the united states has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the

highway route in the americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48,000 km 30,000 mi in length which travels through the mainland nations no definitive length of the pan-american highway exists because the us and canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the pan-american highway and mexico officially has many branches connecting to the us border however the total length of the portion from mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly 26,000 km 16,000 mi 2006 map of the north american class i railroad network the first transcontinental railroad in the united states was built in the 1860s linking the railroad network of the eastern us with california on the pacific coast finished on 10 may 1869 at the famous golden spike event at promontory summit utah it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the american west catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system 126 although an accomplishment it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern us railroads to the pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world the canadian grand trunk railway gtr had by 1867 already accumulated more than 2,055 km 1,277 mi of track by connecting ontario

colonies there is frequent cultural interplay between the united states and english-speaking canada greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous people of canada but is considered nordic and has strong danish ties due to centuries of colonization by denmark spanish-speaking north america shares a common past as former spanish colonies in mexico and the central american countries where civilizations like the maya developed indigenous people preserve traditions across modern boundaries central american and spanish-speaking caribbean nations have historically had more in common due to geographical proximity northern mexico particularly in the cities of monterrey tijuana ciudad ju rez and mexicali is strongly influenced by the culture and way of life of the united states of the aforementioned cities monterrey has been regarded as the most americanized city in mexico 127 immigration to the united states and canada remains a significant attribute of many nations close to the southern border of the us the anglophone caribbean states have witnessed the decline of the british empire and its influence on the region and its replacement by the economic influence of northern america in the anglophone caribbean this is partly due to the relatively small populations of the english-speaking caribbean countries and also because many of them now have more people living abroad than those remaining at home northern mexico the western united states and alberta canada share a cowboy culture sports canada mexico and the us submitted a joint bid to host the 2026 fifa world cup
