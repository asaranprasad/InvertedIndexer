https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation line-of-sight propagation from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search line of sight propagation to an antenna line-of-sight propagation is a characteristic of electromagnetic radiation or acoustic wave propagation which means waves travel in a direct path from the source to the receiver electromagnetic transmission includes light emissions traveling in a straight line the rays or waves may be diffracted refracted reflected or absorbed by the atmosphere and obstructions with material and generally cannot travel over the horizon or behind obstacles in contrast to line-of-sight propagation at low frequency below approximately 3 mhz due to diffraction radio waves can travel as ground waves which follow the contour of the earth this enables am radio stations to transmit beyond the horizon additionally frequencies in the shortwave bands between approximately 1 and 30 mhz can be reflected back to earth by the ionosphere called skywave or skip propagation thus giving radio transmissions in this range a potentially global reach however at frequencies above 30 mhz vhf and higher and in lower levels of the atmosphere neither of these effects are significant thus any obstruction between the transmitting antenna transmitter and the receiving antenna receiver will block the signal just like the light that the eye may sense therefore since the ability to visually see a transmitting antenna disregarding the limitations of the eye s resolution roughly corresponds to the ability to receive a radio signal from it the propagation characteristic at these frequencies is called line-of-sight the farthest possible point of propagation is referred to as the radio horizon in practice the propagation characteristics of these radio waves vary substantially depending on the exact frequency and the strength of the transmitted signal a function of both the transmitter and the antenna characteristics broadcast fm radio at comparatively low frequencies of around 100 mhz are less affected by the presence of buildings and forests contents 1 impairments to line-of-sight propagation 2 mobile telephones

propagation edit objects within the fresnel zone can disturb line of sight propagation even if they don t block the geometric line between antennas low-powered microwave transmitters can be foiled by tree branches or even heavy rain or snow the presence of objects not in the direct line-of-sight can cause diffraction effects that disrupt radio transmissions for the best propagation a volume known as the first fresnel zone should be free of obstructions reflected radiation from the surface of the surrounding ground or salt water can also either cancel out or enhance the direct signal this effect can be reduced by raising either or both antennas further from the ground the reduction in loss achieved is known as height gain it is important to take into account the curvature of the earth for calculation of line-of-sight paths from maps when a direct visual fix cannot be made designs for microwave formerly used 4 3 earth radius to compute clearances along the path mobile telephones edit although the frequencies used by mobile phones cell phones are in the line-of-sight range they still function in cities this is made possible by a combination of the following effects 1 r 4 propagation over the rooftop landscape clarification needed diffraction into the street canyon below multipath reflection along the street diffraction through windows and attenuated passage through walls into the building reflection diffraction and attenuated passage through internal walls floors and ceilings within the building the combination of all these effects makes the mobile phone propagation environment highly complex with multipath effects and extensive rayleigh fading for mobile phone services these problems are tackled using rooftop or hilltop positioning of base stations many base stations usually called cell sites a phone can typically see at least three and usually as many as six at any given time sectorized antennas at the base stations instead of one antenna with omnidirectional coverage the station may use as few as 3 rural areas with few customers or as many as 32 separate antennas each covering a portion of the circular coverage this allows the base station to use a directional antenna that is pointing at the user which improves the signal to noise ratio if the user moves perhaps by walking or driving from one antenna sector to another the base station automatically selects the proper antenna rapid handoff between base stations roaming the radio link used by the phones is a digital link with extensive error correction and detection in the digital protocol sufficient operation of mobile phone in tunnels when supported by split cable antennas local repeaters inside complex vehicles or buildings a faraday cage is composed of a conductor that completely surrounds an area on all sides top and bottom electromagnetic radiation is blocked where the wavelength is longer than any gaps for example mobile telephone signals are blocked in windowless metal enclosures that approximate a faraday cage such as elevator cabins and parts of trains cars and ships the same problem can affect signals in buildings with extensive steel reinforcement two stations not in line-of-sight may be able to communicate through an intermediate radio repeater station radio horizon edit the radio horizon is the locus of points at which direct rays from an antenna are tangential to the surface of the earth if the earth were a perfect sphere without an atmosphere the radio horizon would be a circle the radio horizon of the transmitting and receiving antennas can be added together to increase the effective communication range radio wave propagation is affected by atmospheric conditions ionospheric absorption and the presence of obstructions for example mountains or trees simple formulas that include the effect of the atmosphere give the range as h o r i z o n m i l e s 1.23 h e i g h t f e e t displaystyle mathrm horizon

simple formulas give a best-case approximation of the maximum propagation distance but are not sufficient to estimate the quality of service at any location earth bulge and atmosphere effect edit earth bulge is a term used in telecommunications it refers to the circular segment of earth profile that blocks off long distance communications since the geometric line of sight passes at varying heights over the earth the propagating radio wave encounters slightly different propagation conditions over the path the usual effect of the declining pressure of the atmosphere with height is to bend radio waves down towards the surface of the earth effectively increasing the earth s radius and the distance to the radio horizon by a factor around 4 3 1 this k-factor can change from its average value depending on weather geometric distance to horizon edit r is the radius of the earth h is the height of the transmitter exaggerated d is the line of sight distance assuming a perfect sphere with no terrain irregularity the distance to the horizon from a high altitude transmitter i e line of sight can readily be calculated let r be the radius of the earth and h be the altitude of a telecommunication station the line of sight distance d of this station is given by the pythagorean theorem d 2 r h 2 r 2 2 r h h 2 displaystyle d 2 r h 2 -r 2 2 cdot r cdot h h 2 since the altitude of the station is much less than the radius of the earth d 2 r h displaystyle d approx sqrt 2 cdot r cdot h if the height is given in metres and distance in kilometres 2 d 3.57 h displaystyle d approx 3.57 cdot sqrt h if the height is given in feet and the distance in miles d 1.23 h displaystyle d approx 1.23 cdot sqrt h the actual service range edit the above analysis does not consider the effect of atmosphere on the propagation path of rf signals in fact rf signals don t propagate in straight lines because of the refractive effects of atmospheric layers the propagation paths are somewhat curved thus the maximum service range of the station is not equal to the line of sight geometric distance usually a factor k is used in the equation above modified to be d 2 k r h displaystyle d approx sqrt 2 cdot k cdot r cdot h k 1 means geometrically reduced bulge and a longer service range on the other hand k 1 means a shorter service range under normal weather conditions k is usually chosen 3 to be 4 3 that means that the maximum service range increases by 15 d 4.12 h displaystyle d approx 4.12 cdot sqrt h for h in metres and d in kilometres or d 1.41 h displaystyle d approx 1.41 cdot sqrt h for h in feet and d in miles but in stormy weather k may decrease to cause fading in transmission in extreme cases k can be less than 1 that is equivalent to a hypothetical decrease in earth radius and an increase of earth bulge 4 example edit in normal weather conditions the service range of a station at an altitude of 1500 m with respect to receivers at sea level can be found as d 4.12 1500 160 km displaystyle d approx 4.12 cdot sqrt 1500 160 mbox km see also edit anomalous propagation field strength in free space knife-edge effect multilateration non-line-of-sight propagation
