originates from living organisms most such materials contain carbon and are capable of decay the earliest life on earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago 1 2 3 earlier physical evidences of life include graphite a biogenic substance in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern greenland 4 as well as remains of biotic life found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia 5 6 earth s biodiversity has expanded continually except when interrupted by mass extinctions 7 although scholars estimate that over 99 percent of all species of life over five billion 8 that ever lived on earth are extinct 9 10 there are still an estimated 10 14 million extant species 11 12 of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 have not yet been described 13 examples of biotic materials are wood straw humus manure bark crude oil cotton spider silk chitin fibrin and bone the use of biotic materials and processed biotic materials bio-based material as alternative natural materials over synthetics is popular with those who are environmentally conscious because such materials are usually biodegradable renewable and the processing is commonly understood and has minimal environmental impact however not all biotic materials are used in an environmentally friendly way such as those that require high levels of processing are harvested unsustainably or are used to produce carbon emissions when the source of the recently living material has little importance to the product produced such as in the production of biofuels biotic material is simply called biomass many fuel sources may have biological sources and may be divided roughly into fossil fuels and biofuel in soil science biotic material is often referred to as organic matter biotic materials in soil include glomalin dopplerite and humic acid some biotic material may not be considered to be organic matter if it is low in organic compounds such as a clam s shell which is an essential component of the living organism but contains little organic carbon examples of the use of biotic materials include alternative natural materials building material for a
