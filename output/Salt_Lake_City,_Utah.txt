of the state of utah salt lake city often shortened to salt lake and abbreviated as slc is the capital and the most populous municipality of the u s state of utah with an estimated population of 190,884 in 2014 7 the city is the core of the salt lake city metropolitan area which has a population of 1,153,340 2014 estimate salt lake city is further situated within a larger metropolis known as the salt lake city ogden provo combined statistical area this region is a corridor of contiguous urban and suburban development stretched along an approximately 120-mile 190 km segment of the wasatch front comprising a population of 2,423,912 as of 2014 8 it is one of only two major urban areas in the great basin the other is reno nevada the world headquarters of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints lds church is located in salt lake city and the city s street grid system is based on the temple constructed by the church at its center the city was originally founded in 1847 by brigham young and other followers of the church who were seeking to escape religious persecution in the mid-western united states these mormon pioneers as they would come to be known at first encountered an arid inhospitable valley that they then extensively irrigated and cultivated thereby establishing the foundation to sustain the area s large population of today due to its proximity to the great salt lake the city was originally named great salt lake city however the word great was dropped from the official name in 1868 by the 17th utah territorial legislature 9 immigration of international lds members mining booms and the construction of the first transcontinental railroad initially brought economic growth and the city was nicknamed the crossroads of the west it was traversed by the lincoln highway the first transcontinental highway in 1913 and presently two major cross-country freeways i-15 and i-80 intersect in the city salt lake city has since developed a strong outdoor recreation tourist industry based primarily on skiing and hosted the 2002 winter olympics it is the industrial banking center of the united states 10 contents 1 history 2 geography 2.1

valley for thousands of years at the time of salt lake city s founding the valley was within the territory of the northwestern shoshone 12 however occupation was seasonal near streams emptying from canyons into the salt lake valley one of the local shoshone tribes the western goshute tribe referred to the great salt lake as pi a-pa meaning big water or ti tsa-pa meaning bad water 13 14 the land was treated by the united states as public domain no aboriginal title by the northwestern shoshone was ever recognized by the united states or extinguished by treaty with the united states 15 the first u s explorer in the salt lake area is believed to be jim bridger in 1825 although others had been in utah earlier some as far north as the nearby utah valley the dominguez-escalante expedition of 1776 were undoubtedly aware of salt lake valley s existence u s army officer john c fr mont surveyed the great salt lake and the salt lake valley in 1843 and 1845 16 the donner party a group of ill-fated pioneers had traveled through the great salt lake valley in august 1846 salt lake city c 1880 by carleton e watkins the valley s first permanent settlements date to the arrival of the latter-day saints on july 24 1847 17 they had traveled beyond the boundaries of the united states into mexican territory 18 seeking a secluded area to safely practice their religion away from the violence and the persecution they experienced in the east upon arrival at the salt lake valley president of the church brigham young is recorded as stating this is the right place drive on brigham young claimed to have seen the area in a vision prior to the wagon train s arrival they found the broad valley empty of any human settlement part of main street 1890 four days after arriving in the salt lake valley brigham young designated the building site for the salt lake temple which would become a famous mormon and salt lake city landmark the salt lake temple constructed on the block later called temple square took 40 years to complete construction started in 1853 and the temple was dedicated on april 6 1893 the temple has become an icon for the city and serves as its centerpiece in fact the southeast corner of temple square is the initial point of reference for the salt lake meridian and for all addresses in the salt lake valley the mormon pioneers organized a new state called deseret and petitioned for its recognition in 1849 the united states congress rebuffed the settlers in 1850 and established the utah territory vastly reducing its size and designated fillmore as its capital city great salt lake city replaced fillmore as the territorial capital in 1858 and the name was later abbreviated to salt lake city the city s population continued to swell with an influx of mormon converts and gold rush gold seekers making it one of the most populous cities in the american old west explorer ethnologist and author richard francis burton traveled by coach in the summer of 1860 to document life in great salt lake city he was granted unprecedented access during his three-week visit including audiences with president brigham young and other contemporaries of joseph smith the records of his visit include sketches of early city buildings a description of local geography and agriculture commentary on its politics and social order essays speeches and sermons from brigham young isaac morley george washington bradley and other prominent leaders and snapshots of everyday life such as newspaper clippings and the menu from a high-society ball 19 men lounging outside a saloon and a chinese laundry 1910 disputes with the federal government ensued over the mormon practice of polygamy a climax occurred in 1857 when president james buchanan declared the area in rebellion after brigham young refused to step down as governor beginning the utah war a division of the united states army commanded by albert sidney johnston later a general in the army of the confederate states of america marched through the city and found it had been evacuated this division set up camp floyd approximately 40 mi 64 km southwest of the city another military installation fort douglas was established in 1862 to maintain union allegiance during the american civil war many area leaders were incarcerated at the territorial prison in sugar house in the 1880s for violation of anti-polygamy laws the lds church began their eventual abandonment of polygamy in 1890 releasing the manifesto which officially suggested members obey the law of the land which was equivalent to forbidding new polygamous marriages inside the u s and its territories but not in mormon settlements in canada and mexico this paved the way for statehood in 1896 when salt lake city became the state capital the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869 at promontory summit on the north side of the great salt lake 20 a railroad was connected to the city from the transcontinental railroad in 1870 making travel less burdensome mass migration of different groups followed ethnic chinese who laid most of the central pacific railway established a flourishing chinatown in salt lake city nicknamed plum alley which housed around 1,800 chinese during the early 20th century the chinese businesses and residences were demolished in 1952 although a historical marker has been erected near the parking ramp which has replaced plum alley immigrants also found economic opportunities in the booming mining industries remnants of a once-thriving japantown namely a buddhist temple and japanese christian chapel remain in downtown salt lake city european ethnic groups and east coast missionary groups constructed st mark s episcopal cathedral in 1874 the roman catholic cathedral of the madeleine in 1909 and the greek orthodox holy trinity cathedral in 1923 this time period also saw the creation of salt lake city s now defunct red-light district that employed 300 courtesans at its height before being closed in 1911 21 panorama of temple square taken in 1912 during the late 19th and early 20th centuries an extensive streetcar system was constructed throughout the city with the first streetcar running in 1872 and electrification of the system in 1889 as in the rest of the country the automobile usurped the streetcar and the last trolley was approved for conversion in 1941 yet ran until 1945 due to wwii trolley buses ran until 1946 light rail transit returned to the city when uta s trax opened in 1999 22 the s line formerly known as sugar house streetcar opened for service in december 2013 on an old d rgw right-of-way 23 24 the city s population began to stagnate during the 20th century as population growth shifted to suburban areas north and south of the city few of these areas were annexed to the city while nearby towns incorporated and expanded themselves as a result the population of the surrounding metropolitan area greatly outnumbers salt lake city a major concern of recent government officials has been combating inner-city commercial decay the city lost population from the 1960s through the 1980s but experienced some recovery in the 1990s presently the city has gained an estimated 5 percent of its population since the year 2000 25 the city has experienced significant demographic shifts in recent years 26 hispanics now account for approximately 22 of residents and the city has a significant gay community 27 there is also a large pacific islander population mainly made up of samoans and tongans they compose roughly 2 of the population of the salt lake valley area salt lake city was selected to host the 2002 winter olympics in 1995 the games were plagued with controversy a bid scandal surfaced in 1998 alleging bribes had been offered to secure the city for the 2002 games location during the games other scandals erupted over contested judging scores and illegal drug use despite the controversies the games were heralded as a financial success being one of the few in recent history to profit in preparation major construction projects were initiated local freeways were expanded and repaired and a light rail system was constructed olympic venues are now used for local national and international sporting events and olympic athlete training 28 tourism has increased since the olympic games 29 not in citation given but business did not pick up immediately following them 30 salt lake city expressed interest in bidding for the 2022 winter olympics 31 32 however beijing was selected to host the 2022 winter olympics 33 salt lake city hosted the 16th winter deaflympic games in 2007 taking place in the venues in salt lake city and park city 34 and rotary international chose the city as the host site of their 2007 convention which was the single largest gathering in salt lake city since the 2002 winter olympics 35 the u s volleyball association convention in 2005 drew 39,500 attendees geography edit astronaut photography of salt lake city west of downtown taken from the international space station iss north is at bottom salt lake city and adjacent suburbs facing south salt lake city has an area of 110.4 square miles 286 km2 and an average elevation of 4,327 feet 1,319 m above sea level the lowest point within the boundaries of the city is 4,210 feet 1,280 m near the jordan river and the great salt lake and the highest is grandview peak at 9,410 feet 2,868 m 36 the city is in the northeast corner of the salt lake valley surrounded by the great salt lake to the northwest and the steep wasatch and oquirrh mountain ranges on the eastern and southwestern borders respectively its encircling mountains contain several narrow glacial and stream carved canyons among these canyons city creek emigration millcreek and parley s border the eastern city limits the burgeoning population of salt lake city and the surrounding metropolitan area combined with its geographical situation has led to air quality becoming a top concern for the populace the wasatch front is subject to strong temperature inversions during the winter which trap pollutants and lower air quality 37 the utah division of air quality closely monitors air quality and issues alerts for voluntary and mandatory actions when pollution exceeds federal safety standards citation needed protests have been held at the utah state capitol and democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation in the utah state legislature to make public transportation free during january and july when air quality is usually at its worst 37 the population of the salt lake city metropolitan area is projected to double by 2040 putting further pressure on the region s air quality 38 the great salt lake is separated from salt lake city by extensive marshlands and mudflats the metabolic activities of bacteria in the lake result in a phenomenon known as lake stink a scent reminiscent of foul poultry eggs two to three times per year for a few hours 39 the jordan river flows through the city and is a drainage of utah lake that empties into the great salt lake the highest mountaintop visible from salt lake city is twin peaks which reaches 11,330 feet 3454 m 40 twin peaks is southeast of salt lake city in the wasatch range the wasatch fault is found along the western base of the wasatch and is considered at high risk of producing an earthquake as large as 7.5 catastrophic damage is predicted in the event of an earthquake with major damage resulting from the liquefaction of the clay- and sand-based soil and the possible permanent flooding of portions of the city by the great salt lake 41 the second-highest mountain range is the oquirrhs reaching a maximum height of 10,620 feet 3,237 m at flat top the traverse mountains to the south extend to 6,000 feet 1,830 m nearly connecting the wasatch and oquirrh mountains the mountains near salt lake city are easily visible from the city and have sharp vertical relief caused by ancient earthquakes with a maximum difference of 7,099 feet 2164 m being achieved with the rise of twin peaks from the salt lake valley floor 40 the salt lake valley floor is the ancient lakebed of lake bonneville which existed at the end of the last ice age several lake bonneville shorelines can be distinctly seen on the foothills or benches of nearby mountains a panoramic view of salt lake city june 2009 layout edit plat of salt lake city circa 1870s the city as well as the county is laid out on a grid plan 42 most major streets run very nearly north-south and east-west the grid s origin is the southeast corner of temple square the block containing the salt lake temple the north-south axis is main street and the east-west axis is south temple street addresses are coordinates within the system similarly to latitude and longitude odd and even address numbering depends on the quadrant of the grid in which an address is located the rule is when traveling away from the grid center temple square or its axes main street south temple street odd numbers will be on the left side of the street the streets are relatively wide due to the direction of brigham young who wanted them wide enough a wagon team could turn around without resorting to profanity 43 these wide streets and grid pattern are typical of other mormon towns of the pioneer era throughout the west though the nomenclature may initially confuse new arrivals and visitors most consider the grid system an aid to navigation citation needed some streets have names such as state street which would otherwise be known as 100 east other streets have honorary names such as the western portion of 300 south named adam galvez street in honor of a local marine corporal killed in action or others honoring rosa parks martin luther king jr c sar ch vez and john stockton these honorary names appear only on street signs and cannot be used in postal addresses the salt palace in the avenues neighborhood north-south streets are given letters of the alphabet and east-west streets are numbered in 2.5-acre 1.0 ha blocks smaller than those in the rest of the city joseph smith founder of the latter-day saint movement planned the layout in the plat of the city of zion intended as a template for mormon towns wherever they might be built in his plan the city was to be developed into 135 10-acre 4.0 ha lots however the blocks in salt lake city became irregular during the late 19th century when the lds church lost authority over growth and before the adoption of zoning ordinances in the 1920s the original 10-acre 4.0 ha blocks allowed for large garden plots and many were supplied with irrigation water from ditches that ran approximately where modern curbs and gutters would be laid the original water supply was from city creek subsequent development of water resources was from successively more southern streams flowing from the mountains to the east of the city some of the old irrigation ditches are still visible in the eastern suburbs or are still marked on maps years after they were gone there are still some canals that deliver water as required by water rights many lots in salt lake city and surrounding areas have irrigation water rights attached to them local water systems in particular salt lake city public utilities have a tendency to acquire or trade for these water rights these can then be traded for culinary water rights to water imported into the valley at its peak irrigation in the valley comprised over one hundred distinct canal systems many originating at the jordan narrows at the south end of the valley water and water rights were very important in the 19th and early 20th centuries as heavy agricultural usage changed into a more urban and suburban pattern canal water companies were gradually replaced by culinary water systems neighborhoods edit salt lake city has many informal neighborhoods the eastern portion of the city is less affordable than its western counterpart this is a result of the railroad being built in the western half as well as panoramic views from inclined ground in the eastern portion housing is more economically diverse on the west side which results in demographic differences interstate 15 was also built in a north-south line further dividing east and west sides of the city the west side of the city has historically been more culturally diverse people of many faiths races and backgrounds live in the neighborhoods of rose park westpointe poplar grove and glendale it has always been considered a classic and diverse area although recently its affordability has attracted many professionals and the more youthful generation sugar house sugar house in southeastern salt lake city has a reputation as an older neighborhood with lots of small shops in the center 44 sugar house is an area which has been the focus of redevelopment efforts such as the uta s-line streetcar in late 2015 there were approximately 900 apartment units either recently built or under construction in the sugar house area with an additional 492 units proposed 45 just northeast of downtown is the avenues a neighborhood outside of the regular grid system on much smaller blocks the area from south temple north to 6th avenue is a historical district that is nearly entirely residential and contains many historical victorian era homes recently the avenues is becoming known for restaurants and shops opening in old retail space mixed within the community the avenues are situated on the upward-sloping bench in the foothills of the wasatch range with the earlier built homes in the lower elevation the avenues along with federal heights just to the east and north of the university of utah and the foothill area south of the university contain gated communities large multimillion-dollar houses and panoramic views of the valley many consider this some of the most desirable real estate in the valley citation needed in addition to larger centers like sugar house and downtown salt lake city contains several smaller neighborhoods each named after the closest major intersection two examples are the 9th and 9th at the intersection of 900 east and 900 south streets and 15th 15th at the intersection of 1500 east and 1500 south streets neighborhoods these areas are home to foot-traffic friendly amenities-based businesses such as art galleries clothing retail salons restaurants and coffee shops during the summer of 2007 9th and 9th saw sidewalk and street improvements as well as an art installation by troy pillow of seattle washington inspired by the 9 muses of greek myth thanks in part to a monetary grant from salt lake city many of the homes in the valley date from pre world war ii times and only a select few areas such as federal heights and the east bench as well as the far west side including parts of rose park and glendale have seen new home construction since the 1970s climate edit the climate of salt lake city is commonly claimed to be semi-arid but under the k ppen climate classification salt lake city has a hot-summer humid continental climate dfa with hot summers and cold snowy winters 46 the primary source of precipitation in salt lake city is massive storms that move in from the pacific ocean along the jet stream from october to may in mid-to-late summer when the jet stream retreats far to the north precipitation mainly comes from afternoon thunderstorms caused by monsoon moisture moving up from the gulf of california although rainfall can be heavy these storms are usually scattered in coverage and rarely severe however downtown was hit by an f2 tornado on august 11 1999 killing 1 person injuring 60 and causing 170 million in damage the remnants of tropical cyclones from the east pacific can rarely reach the city during fall the remnants of hurricane olivia helped bring the record monthly precipitation of 7.04 inches 179 mm in september 1982 47 48 1983 was the wettest year on record with 24.26 inches 616 mm while 1979 was the driest when 8.70 inches 221 mm were recorded 49 spring snowmelt from the surrounding mountains can cause localized stream flooding during late spring and early summer the worst examples being in 1952 and especially 1983 when city creek burst its banks creek-bed scouring in memory grove caused by high spring run-off in city creek filled much of the submerged waterway running westward under north temple street towards the jordan river forcing city engineers to convert several downtown streets into waterways 50 snow falls on average from november 6 to april 18 producing a total average of 60 inches 152 cm although measurable snow has fallen as early as september 17 and as late as may 28 51 52 53 the snowiest season was 1951 52 with 117.3 inches 298 cm while the least snowy season was 16.6 inches 42 cm in 1933 34 54 the snowiest month on record was january 1993 in which 50.3 inches 128 cm were recorded 55 the nearby great salt lake is a significant contributor to precipitation in the city the lake effect can help enhance rain from summer thunderstorms and produces lake-effect snow approximately 6 to 8 times per year some of which can drop excessive snowfalls it is estimated about 10 of the annual precipitation in the city can be attributed to the lake effect 56 salt lake city features large variations in temperatures between seasons during summer there are an average of 56 days per year with temperatures of at least 90 f 32.2 c 23 days of at least 95 f 35 c and 5 days of 100 f 37.8 c 57 however average daytime july humidity is only 22 58 winters are quite cold but rarely frigid while an average of 127 days drop to or below freezing 59 and 26 days with high temperatures that fail to rise above freezing 59 the city only averages 2.3 days at or below 0 f 17.8 c 59 the record high temperature is 107 f 42 c which occurred first on july 26 1960 and again on july 13 2002 while the record low is 30 f 34 c which occurred on february 9 1933 during mid-winter strong areas of high pressure often situate themselves over the great basin leading to strong temperature inversions this causes air stagnation and thick smog in the valley from several days to weeks at a time and can result in the worst air-pollution levels in the u s reducing air quality to unhealthy levels 60 61 this same effect will also occasionally play a role in the summer months causing tropospheric ozone to peak in july august but in 2015 it started at the beginning of june 62 in 2016 salt lake s air quality was ranked 6th worst in the nation by the american lung association it received an f grade for both ozone and particulate matter particulate pollution is considered especially dangerous as the tiny pollutants can lodge deep in lung tissue both ozone and particulate pollution are associated with increased rates of strokes heart attacks respiratory disease cancer and premature death 63 outdoor air particulates have been associated with
