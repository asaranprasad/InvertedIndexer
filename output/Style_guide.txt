and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another in a way analogous to how styles cascade in web development and in desktop publishing e g how inline styles in html cascade over css styles a short style guide is often called a style sheet a comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a style manual or manual of style mos or mos in many cases a project such as one book journal or monograph series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a publishing company whose content is usually called house style most house styles in turn cascade over an industry-wide or profession-wide style manual that is even more comprehensive some examples of these industry style guides include the following ap style for journalism and most forms of corporate communications usgpo style or agps style for government publications oxford style and chicago style for academic publishing and readership apa style and asa style for the social sciences cse style for various physical sciences acs style for chemistry ama style for medicine bluebook style for law finally these reference works cascade over the orthographic norms of the language in use for example english orthography for english-language publications this of course may be subject to national variety such as the different varieties of american english and british english topics edit some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as graphic design including typography website style guides cover a publication s visual and technical aspects along with text style guides that cover usage may suggest ways of describing people that avoid racism sexism and homophobia guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover nomenclature which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear standardized and ontologically sound e g taxonomy chemical nomenclature and gene nomenclature updating edit most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and usage the frequency of updating and the revision control are determined by the subject matter for style manuals in reference work format new editions typically appear every 1 to 20 years for example the ap stylebook is revised annually and the chicago apa and asa manuals are in their 17th 6th and 4th editions respectively many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently especially for new projects examples edit international edit several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international standards organizations one example is iso 215 documentation presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials 1 europe
