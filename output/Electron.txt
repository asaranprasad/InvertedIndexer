lepton particle family 9 and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure 1 the electron has a mass that is approximately 1 1836 that of the proton 10 quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum spin of a half-integer value expressed in units of the reduced planck constant as it is a fermion no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state in accordance with the pauli exclusion principle 9 like all elementary particles electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light the wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer de broglie wavelength for a given energy electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena such as electricity magnetism chemistry and thermal conductivity and they also participate in gravitational electromagnetic and weak interactions 11 since an electron has charge it has a surrounding electric field and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the lorentz force law electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics welding cathode ray tubes electron microscopes radiation therapy lasers gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics the coulomb force interaction between the positive protons within atomic nuclei and the negative electrons without allows the composition of the two known as atoms ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the binding energy of an atomic system the exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding 12 in 1838 british natural philosopher richard laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms 3 irish physicist george johnstone stoney named this charge electron in 1891 and j j thomson and his team of british physicists identified it as a particle in 1897 5 13 14 electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions such as nucleosynthesis in stars where they are known as beta particles electrons can be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere the antiparticle of the electron is called the positron it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign when an electron collides with a positron both particles can be totally annihilated producing gamma ray photons contents 1 history 1.1 discovery 1.2 atomic theory 1.3 quantum mechanics 1.4 particle accelerators 1.5

the ancient greeks noticed that amber attracted small objects when rubbed with fur along with lightning this phenomenon is one of humanity s earliest recorded experiences with electricity 15 in his 1600 treatise de magnete the english scientist william gilbert coined the new latin term electricus to refer to this property of attracting small objects after being rubbed 16 both electric and electricity are derived from the latin lectrum also the root of the alloy of the same name which came from the greek word for amber lektron in the early 1700s francis hauksbee and french chemist charles fran ois du fay independently discovered what they believed were two kinds of frictional electricity one generated from rubbing glass the other from rubbing resin from this du fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids vitreous and resinous that are separated by friction and that neutralize each other when combined 17 american scientist ebenezer kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion 18 118 a decade later benjamin franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid but a single electrical fluid showing an excess or deficit - he gave them the modern charge nomenclature of positive and negative respectively 19 franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier and which situation was a deficit 20 between 1838 and 1851 british natural philosopher richard laming developed the idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit electric charges 2 beginning in 1846 german physicist william weber theorized that electricity was composed of positively and negatively charged fluids and their interaction was governed by the inverse square law after studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in 1874 irish physicist george johnstone stoney suggested that there existed a single definite quantity of electricity the charge of a monovalent ion he was able to estimate the value of this elementary charge e by means of faraday s laws of electrolysis 21 however stoney believed these charges were permanently attached to atoms and could not be removed in 1881 german physicist hermann von helmholtz argued that both positive and negative charges were divided into elementary parts each of which behaves like atoms of electricity 3 stoney initially coined the term electrolion in 1881 ten years later he switched to electron to describe these elementary charges writing in 1894 an estimate was made of the actual amount of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity for which i have since ventured to suggest the name electron a 1906 proposal to change to electrion failed because hendrik lorentz preferred to keep electron 22 23 the word electron is a combination of the words electric and ion 24 the suffix -on which is now used to designate other subatomic particles such as a proton or neutron is in turn derived from electron 25 26 discovery edit a beam of electrons deflected in a circle by a magnetic field 27 electron detected in an isopropanol cloud chamber the german physicist johann wilhelm hittorf studied electrical conductivity in rarefied gases in 1869 he discovered a glow emitted from the cathode that increased in size with decrease in gas pressure in 1876 the german physicist eugen goldstein showed that the rays from this glow cast a shadow and he dubbed the rays cathode rays 28 during the 1870s the english chemist and physicist sir william crookes developed the first cathode ray tube to have a high vacuum inside 29 he then showed that the luminescence rays appearing within the tube carried energy and moved from the cathode to the anode furthermore by applying a magnetic field he was able to deflect the rays thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as though it were negatively charged 30 31 in 1879 he proposed that these properties could be explained by what he termed radiant matter he suggested that this was a fourth state of matter consisting of negatively charged molecules that were being projected with high velocity from the cathode 32 the german-born british physicist arthur schuster expanded upon crookes experiments by placing metal plates parallel to the cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates the field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge by measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current in 1890 schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components however this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected so little credence was given to his calculations at the time 30 33 in 1892 hendrik lorentz suggested that the mass of these particles electrons could be a consequence of their electric charge 34 in 1896 the british physicist j j thomson with his colleagues john s townsend and h a wilson 13 performed experiments indicating that cathode rays really were unique particles rather than waves atoms or molecules as was believed earlier 5 thomson made good estimates of both the charge e and the mass m finding that cathode ray particles which he called corpuscles had perhaps one thousandth of the mass of the least massive ion known hydrogen 5 14 he showed that their charge-to-mass ratio e m was independent of cathode material he further showed that the negatively charged particles produced by radioactive materials by heated materials and by illuminated materials were universal 5 35 the name electron was again proposed for these particles by the irish physicist george johnstone stoney and the name has since gained universal acceptance robert millikan while studying naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896 the french physicist henri becquerel discovered that they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source these radioactive materials became the subject of much interest by scientists including the new zealand physicist ernest rutherford who discovered they emitted particles he designated these particles alpha and beta on the basis of their ability to penetrate matter 36 in 1900 becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays 37 this evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms 38 39 the electron s charge was more carefully measured by the american physicists robert millikan and harvey fletcher in their oil-drop experiment of 1909 the results of which were published in 1911 this experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity this device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1 150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3 comparable experiments had been done earlier by thomson s team 5 using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis 13 and in 1911 by abram ioffe who independently obtained the same result as millikan using charged microparticles of metals then published his results in 1913 40 however oil drops were more stable than water drops because of their slower evaporation rate and thus more suited to precise experimentation over longer periods of time 41 around the beginning of the twentieth century it was found that under certain conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along its path in 1911 charles wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles such as fast-moving electrons 42 atomic theory edit the bohr model of the atom showing states of electron with energy quantized by the number n an electron dropping to a lower orbit emits a photon equal to the energy difference between the orbits by 1914 experiments by physicists ernest rutherford henry moseley james franck and gustav hertz had largely established the structure of an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons 43 in 1913 danish physicist niels bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron s orbit about the nucleus the electrons could move between those states or orbits by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies by means of these quantized orbits he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom 44 however bohr s model failed to account for the relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms 43 chemical bonds between atoms were explained by gilbert newton lewis who in 1916 proposed that a covalent bond between two atoms is maintained by a pair of electrons shared between them 45 later in 1927 walter heitler and fritz london gave the full explanation of the electron-pair formation and chemical bonding in terms of quantum mechanics 46 in 1919 the american chemist irving langmuir elaborated on the lewis static model of the atom and suggested that all electrons were distributed in successive concentric nearly spherical shells all of equal thickness 47 in turn he divided the shells into a number of cells each of which contained one pair of electrons with this model langmuir was able to qualitatively explain the chemical properties of all elements in the periodic table 46 which were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law 48 in 1924 austrian physicist wolfgang pauli observed that the shell-like structure of the atom could be explained by a set of four parameters that defined every quantum energy state as long as each state was occupied by no more than a single electron this prohibition against more than one electron occupying the same quantum energy state became known as the pauli exclusion principle 49 the physical mechanism to explain the fourth parameter which had two distinct possible values was provided by the dutch physicists samuel goudsmit and george uhlenbeck in 1925 they suggested that an electron in addition to the angular momentum of its orbit possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment 43 50 this is analogous to the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits the sun the intrinsic angular momentum became known as spin and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting 51 quantum mechanics edit in his 1924 dissertation recherches sur la th orie des quanta research on quantum theory french physicist louis de broglie hypothesized that all matter can be represented as a de broglie wave in the manner of light 52 that is under the appropriate conditions electrons and other matter would show properties of either particles or waves the corpuscular properties of a particle are demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in space along its trajectory at any given moment 53 the wave-like nature of light is displayed for example when a beam of light is passed through parallel slits thereby creating interference patterns in 1927 george paget thomson discovered the interference effect was produced when a beam of electrons was passed through thin metal foils and by american physicists clinton davisson and lester germer by the reflection of electrons from a crystal of nickel 54 in quantum mechanics the behavior of an electron in an atom is described by an orbital which is a probability distribution rather than an orbit in the figure the shading indicates the relative probability to find the electron having the energy corresponding to the given quantum numbers at that point de broglie s prediction of a wave nature for electrons led erwin schr dinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving under the influence of the nucleus in the atom in 1926 this equation the schr dinger equation successfully described how electron waves propagated 55 rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position especially a position near where the electron was bound in space for which the electron wave equations did not change in time this approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics the first by heisenberg in 1925 and solutions of schr dinger s equation like heisenberg s provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by bohr in 1913 and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum 56 once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen 57 in 1928 building on wolfgang pauli s work paul dirac produced a model of the electron the dirac equation consistent with relativity theory by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field 58 in order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation dirac developed in 1930 a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy later dubbed the dirac sea this led him to predict the existence of a positron the antimatter counterpart of the electron 59 this particle was discovered in 1932 by carl anderson who proposed calling standard electrons negatrons and using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants in 1947 willis lamb working in collaboration with graduate student robert retherford found that certain quantum states of the hydrogen atom which should have the same energy were shifted in relation to each other the difference came to be called the lamb shift about the same time polykarp kusch working with henry m foley discovered the magnetic moment of the electron is slightly larger than predicted by dirac s theory this small difference was later called anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron this difference was later explained by the theory of quantum electrodynamics developed by sin-itiro tomonaga julian schwinger and richard feynman in the late 1940s 60 particle accelerators edit with the development of the particle accelerator during the first half of the twentieth century physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles 61 the first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by donald kerst his initial betatron reached energies of 2.3 mev while subsequent betatrons achieved 300 mev in 1947 synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70 mev electron synchrotron at general electric this radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light 62 with a beam energy of 1.5 gev the first high-energy particle collider was adone which began operations in 1968 63 this device accelerated electrons and positrons in opposite directions effectively doubling the energy of their collision when compared to striking a static target with an electron 64 the large electron positron collider lep at cern which was operational from 1989 to 2000 achieved collision energies of 209 gev and made important measurements for the standard model of particle physics 65 66 confinement of individual electrons edit individual electrons can now be easily confined in ultra small l 20 nm w 20 nm cmos transistors operated at cryogenic temperature over a range of 269 c 4 k to about 258 c 15 k 67 the electron wavefunction spreads in a semiconductor lattice and negligibly interacts with the valence band electrons so it can be treated in the single particle formalism by replacing its mass with the effective mass tensor characteristics edit classification edit standard model of elementary particles the electron symbol e is on the left in the standard model of particle physics electrons belong to the group of subatomic particles called leptons which are believed to be fundamental or elementary particles electrons have the lowest mass of any charged lepton or electrically charged particle of any type and belong to the first-generation of fundamental particles 68 the second and third generation contain charged leptons the muon and the tau which are identical to the electron in charge spin and interactions but are more massive leptons differ from the other basic constituent of matter the quarks by their lack of strong interaction all members of the lepton group are fermions because they all have half-odd integer spin the electron has spin 1 2 69 fundamental properties edit the invariant mass of an electron is approximately 6969910900000000000 9.109 10 31 kilograms 70 or 6996548900000000000 5.489 10 4 atomic mass units on the basis of einstein s principle of mass energy equivalence this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0.511 mev the ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is about 1836 10 71 astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron mass ratio has held the same value as is predicted by the standard model for at least half the age of the universe 72 electrons have an electric charge of 3018839800000000000 1.602 10 19 coulomb 70 which is used as a standard unit of charge for subatomic particles and is also called the elementary charge this elementary charge has a relative standard uncertainty of 6992220000000000000 2.2 10 8 70 within the limits of experimental accuracy the electron charge is identical to the charge of a proton but with the opposite sign 73 as the symbol e is used for the elementary charge the electron is commonly symbolized by e where the minus sign indicates the negative charge the positron is symbolized by e because it has the same properties as the electron but with a positive rather than negative charge 69 70 the electron has an intrinsic angular momentum or spin of 1 2 70 this property is usually stated by referring to the electron as a spin-1 2 particle 69 for such particles the spin magnitude is 3 2 note 3 while the result of the measurement of a projection of the spin on any axis can only be 2 in addition to spin the electron has an intrinsic magnetic moment along its spin axis 70 it is approximately equal to one bohr magneton 74 note 4 which is a physical constant equal to 6976927400914999999 9.27400915 23 10 24 joules per tesla 70 the orientation of the spin with respect to the momentum of the electron defines the property of elementary particles known as helicity 75 the electron has no known substructure 1 76 and it is assumed to be a point particle with a point charge and no spatial extent 9 in classical physics the angular momentum and magnetic moment of an object depend upon its physical dimensions hence the concept of a dimensionless electron possessing these properties contrasts to experimental observations in penning traps which point to finite non-zero radius of the electron citation needed a possible explanation of this paradoxical situation is given below in the virtual particles subsection by taking into consideration the foldy-wouthuysen transformation the issue of the radius of the electron is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics the admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity on the other hand a point-like electron zero radius generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity 77 observation of a single electron in a penning trap suggests the upper limit of the particle s radius to be 10 22 meters 78 the upper bound of the electron radius of 10 18 meters 79 can be derived using the uncertainty relation in energy there is also a physical constant called the classical electron radius with the much larger value of 6985281789999999999 2.8179 10 15 m greater than the radius of the proton however the terminology comes from a simplistic calculation that ignores the effects of quantum mechanics in reality the so-called classical electron radius has little to do with the true fundamental structure of the electron 80 note 5 there are elementary particles that spontaneously decay into less massive particles an example is the muon with a mean lifetime of 6994220000000000000 2.2 10 6 seconds which decays into an electron a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino the electron on the other hand is thought to be stable on theoretical grounds the electron is the least massive particle with non-zero electric charge so its decay would violate charge conservation 81 the experimental lower bound for the electron s mean lifetime is 7028659999999999999 6.6 1028 years at a 90 confidence level 7 82 83 quantum properties edit as with all particles electrons can act as waves this is called the wave particle duality and can be demonstrated using the double-slit experiment the wave-like nature of the electron allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously rather than just one slit as would be the case for a classical particle in quantum mechanics the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function the wave function commonly denoted by the greek letter psi when the absolute value of this function is squared it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location a probability density 84 162 218 example of an antisymmetric wave function for a quantum state of two identical fermions in a 1-dimensional box if the particles swap position the wave function inverts its sign electrons are identical particles because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties in quantum mechanics this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system the wave function of fermions including electrons is antisymmetric meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped that is r1 r2 r2 r1 where the variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons respectively since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap this corresponds to equal probabilities bosons such as the photon have symmetric wave functions instead 84 162 218 in the case of antisymmetry solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state this is responsible for the pauli exclusion principle which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state this principle explains many of the properties of electrons for example it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit 84 162 218 virtual particles edit in a simplified picture every photon spends some time as a combination of a virtual electron plus its antiparticle the virtual positron which rapidly annihilate each other shortly thereafter 85 the combination of the energy variation needed to create these particles and the time during which they exist fall under the threshold of detectability expressed by the heisenberg uncertainty relation e t in effect the energy needed to create these virtual particles e can be borrowed from the vacuum for a period of time t so that their product is no more than the reduced planck constant 6984660000000000000 6.6 10 16 ev s thus for a virtual electron t is at most 6979129999999999999 1.3 10 21 s 86 a schematic depiction of virtual electron positron pairs appearing at random near an electron at lower left while an electron positron virtual pair is in existence the coulomb force from the ambient electric field surrounding an electron causes a created positron to be attracted to the original electron while a created electron experiences a repulsion this causes what is called vacuum polarization in effect the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity more than unity thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron 87 88 this polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the japanese tristan particle accelerator 89 virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for the mass of the electron 90 the interaction with virtual particles also explains the small about 0.1 deviation of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron from the bohr magneton the anomalous magnetic moment 74 91 the extraordinarily precise agreement of this predicted difference with the experimentally determined value is viewed as one of the great achievements of quantum electrodynamics 92 the apparent paradox mentioned above in the properties subsection of a point particle electron having intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic moment can be explained by the formation of virtual photons in the electric field generated by the electron these photons cause the electron to shift about in a jittery fashion known as zitterbewegung 93 which results in a net circular motion with precession this motion produces both the spin and the magnetic moment of the electron 9 94 in atoms this creation of virtual photons explains the lamb shift observed in spectral lines 87 interaction edit an electron generates an electric field that exerts an attractive force on a particle with a positive charge such as the proton and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge the strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by coulomb s inverse square law 95 58 61 when an electron is in motion it generates a magnetic field 84 140 the amp re-maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons the current with respect to an observer this property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor 96 the electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the li nard wiechert potentials which are valid even when the particle s speed is close to that of light relativistic 95 429 434 a particle with charge q at left is moving with velocity v through a magnetic field b that is oriented toward the viewer for an electron q is negative so it follows a curved trajectory toward the top when an electron is moving through a magnetic field it is subject to the lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity this centripetal force causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius the acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation 84 160 97 note 6 the energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron known as the abraham lorentz dirac force which creates a friction that slows the electron this force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron s own field upon itself 98 photons mediate electromagnetic interactions between particles in quantum electrodynamics an isolated electron at a constant velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum instead virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles this exchange of virtual photons for example generates the coulomb force 99 energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle such as a proton the acceleration of the electron results in the emission of bremsstrahlung radiation 100 here bremsstrahlung is produced by an electron e deflected by the electric field of an atomic nucleus the energy change e 2 e 1 determines the frequency f of the emitted photon an inelastic collision between a photon light and a solitary free electron is called compton scattering this collision results in a transfer of momentum and energy between the particles which modifies the wavelength of the photon by an amount called the compton shift note 7 the maximum magnitude of this wavelength shift is h mec which is known as the compton wavelength 101 for an electron it has a value of 6988243000000000000 2.43 10 12 m 70 when the wavelength of the light is long for instance the wavelength of the visible light is 0.4 0.7 m the wavelength shift becomes negligible such interaction between the light and free electrons is called thomson scattering or linear thomson scattering 102 the relative strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two charged particles such as an electron and a proton is given by the fine-structure constant this value is a dimensionless quantity formed by the ratio of two energies the electrostatic energy of attraction or repulsion at a separation of one compton wavelength and the rest energy of the charge it is given by 6997729735300000000 7.297353 10 3 which is approximately equal to 1 137 70 when electrons and positrons collide they annihilate each other giving rise to two or more gamma ray photons if the electron and positron have negligible momentum a positronium atom can form before annihilation results in two or three gamma ray photons totalling 1.022 mev 103 104 on the other hand high-energy photons can transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production but only in the presence of a nearby charged particle such as a nucleus 105 106 in the theory of electroweak interaction the left-handed component of electron s wavefunction forms a weak isospin doublet with the electron neutrino this means that during weak interactions electron neutrinos behave like electrons either member of this doublet can undergo a charged current interaction by emitting or absorbing a w and be converted into the other member charge is conserved during this reaction because the w boson also carries a charge canceling out any net change during the transmutation charged current interactions are responsible for the phenomenon of beta decay in a radioactive atom both the electron and electron neutrino can undergo a neutral current interaction via a z0 exchange and this is responsible for neutrino-electron elastic scattering 107 atoms and molecules edit probability densities for the first few hydrogen atom orbitals seen in cross-section the energy level of a bound electron determines the orbital it occupies and the color reflects the probability of finding the electron at a given position an electron can be bound to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive coulomb force a system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom if the number of electrons is different from the nucleus electrical charge such an atom is called an ion the wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy angular momentum and projection of angular momentum and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus according to the pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons which must differ in their spin quantum number electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential 108 other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles such as electrons and the auger effect 109 to escape the atom the energy of the electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom this occurs for example with the photoelectric effect where an incident photon exceeding the atom s ionization energy is absorbed by the electron 110 the orbital angular momentum of electrons is quantized because the electron is charged it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is proportional to the angular momentum the net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus the magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons the magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital so called paired electrons cancel each other out 111 the chemical bond between atoms occurs as a result of electromagnetic interactions as described by the laws of quantum mechanics 112 the strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms allowing the formation of molecules 12 within a molecule electrons move under the influence of several nuclei and occupy molecular orbitals much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms 113 a fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs these are electrons with opposed spins allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the pauli exclusion principle much like in atoms different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density for instance in bonded pairs i e in the pairs that actually bind atoms together electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei by contrast in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei 114 conductivity edit a lightning discharge consists primarily of a flow of electrons 115 the electric potential needed for lightning can be generated by a triboelectric effect 116 117 if a body has more or fewer electrons than are required to balance the positive charge of the nuclei then that object has a net electric charge when there is an excess of electrons the object is said to be negatively charged when there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei the object is said to be positively charged when the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral a macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing by the triboelectric effect 118 independent electrons moving in vacuum are termed free electrons electrons in metals also behave as if they were free in reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons quasiparticles which have the same electrical charge spin and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass 119 when free electrons both in vacuum and metals move they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current which generates a magnetic field likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field these interactions are described mathematically by maxwell s equations 120 at a given temperature each material has an electrical conductivity that determines the value of electric current when an electric potential is applied examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold whereas glass and teflon are poor conductors in any dielectric material the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation 121 on the other hand metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands the presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave as if they were free or delocalized electrons these electrons are not associated with specific atoms so when an electric field is applied they are free to move like a gas called fermi gas 122 through the material much like free electrons because of collisions between electrons and atoms the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor is on the order of millimeters per second however the speed at which a change of current at one point in the material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material the velocity of propagation is typically about 75 of light speed 123 this occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material 124 metals make relatively good conductors of heat primarily because the delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms however unlike electrical conductivity the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature this is expressed mathematically by the wiedemann franz law 122 which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature the thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material producing a temperature dependence for electric current 125 when cooled below a point called the critical temperature materials can undergo a phase transition in which they lose all resistivity to electric current in a process known as superconductivity in bcs theory this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a bose einstein condensate these cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance 126 cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100 nm so they can overlap each other 127 however the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain electrons inside conducting solids which are quasi-particles themselves when tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero behave as though they had split into three other quasiparticles spinons orbitons and holons 128 129 the former carries spin and magnetic moment the next carries its orbital location while the latter electrical charge motion and energy edit according to einstein s theory of special relativity as an electron s speed approaches the speed of light from an observer s point of view its relativistic mass increases thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observer s frame of reference the speed of an electron can approach but never reach the speed of light in a vacuum c however when relativistic electrons that is electrons moving at a speed close to c are injected into a dielectric medium such as water where the local speed of light is significantly less than c the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium as they interact with the medium they generate a faint light called cherenkov radiation 130 lorentz factor as a function of velocity it starts at value 1 and goes to infinity as v approaches c the effects of special relativity are based on a quantity known as the lorentz factor defined as 1 1 v 2 c 2 displaystyle scriptstyle gamma 1 sqrt 1- v 2 c 2 where v is the speed of the particle the kinetic energy ke of an electron moving with velocity v is k e 1 m e c 2 displaystyle displaystyle k mathrm e gamma -1 m mathrm e c 2 where me is the mass of electron for example the stanford linear accelerator can accelerate an electron to roughly 51 gev 131 since an electron behaves as a wave at a given velocity it has a characteristic de broglie wavelength this is given by e h p where h is the planck constant and p is the momentum 52 for the 51 gev electron above the wavelength is about 6983240000000000000 2.4 10 17 m small enough to explore structures well below the size of an atomic nucleus 132 formation edit pair production caused by the collision of a photon with an atomic nucleus the big bang theory is the most widely accepted scientific theory to explain the early stages in the evolution of the universe 133 for the first millisecond of the big bang the temperatures were over 10 billion kelvins and photons had mean energies over a million electronvolts these photons were sufficiently energetic that they could react with each other to form pairs of electrons and positrons likewise positron-electron pairs annihilated each other and emitted energetic photons e e an equilibrium between electrons positrons and photons was maintained during this phase of the evolution of the universe after 15 seconds had passed however the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where electron-positron formation could occur most of the surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe 134 for reasons that remain uncertain during the annihilation process there was an excess in the number of particles over antiparticles hence about one electron for every billion electron-positron pairs survived this excess matched the excess of protons over antiprotons in a condition known as baryon asymmetry resulting in a net charge of zero for the universe 135 136 the surviving protons and neutrons began to participate in reactions with each other in the process known as nucleosynthesis forming isotopes of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of lithium this process peaked after about five minutes 137 any leftover neutrons underwent negative beta decay with a half-life of about a thousand seconds releasing a proton and electron in the process n p e e for about the next 7005300000000000000 300000 7013126230400000000 400000 years the excess electrons remained too energetic to bind with atomic nuclei 138 what followed is a period known as recombination when neutral atoms were formed and the expanding universe became transparent to radiation 139 roughly one million years after the big bang the first generation of stars began to form 139 within a star stellar nucleosynthesis results in the production of positrons from the fusion of atomic nuclei these antimatter particles immediately annihilate with electrons releasing gamma rays the net result is a steady reduction in the number of electrons and a matching increase in the number of neutrons however the process of stellar evolution can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes selected isotopes can subsequently undergo negative beta decay emitting an electron and antineutrino from the nucleus 140 an example is the cobalt-60 60co isotope which decays to form nickel-60 60 ni 141 an extended air shower generated by an energetic cosmic ray striking the earth s atmosphere at the end of its lifetime a star with more than about 20 solar masses can undergo gravitational collapse to form a black hole 142 according to classical physics these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything even electromagnetic radiation from escaping past the schwarzschild radius however quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of hawking radiation at this distance electrons and positrons are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants when a pair of virtual particles such as an electron and positron is created in the vicinity of the event horizon random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior this process is called quantum tunnelling the gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle allowing it to radiate away into space 143 in exchange the other member of the pair is given negative energy which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole the rate of hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until finally it explodes 144 cosmic rays are particles traveling through space with high energies energy events as high as 7001480652946100000 3.0 1020 ev have been recorded 145 when these particles collide with nucleons in the earth s atmosphere a shower of particles is generated including pions 146 more than half of the cosmic radiation observed from the earth s surface consists of muons the particle called a muon is a lepton produced in the upper atmosphere by the decay of a pion a muon in turn can decay to form an electron or positron 147 e e observation edit aurorae are mostly caused by energetic electrons precipitating into the atmosphere 148 remote observation of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy for example in high-energy environments such as the corona of a star free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to bremsstrahlung radiation electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes 149 the frequency of a photon is proportional to its energy as a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies for instance when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines such as the hydrogen spectral series spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined 150 151 in laboratory conditions the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy spin and charge 110 the development of the paul trap and penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations this enables precise measurements of the particle properties for example in one instance a penning trap was used to contain a single electron for a period of 10 months 152 the magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits which in 1980 was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant 153 the first video images of an electron s energy distribution were captured by a team at lund university in sweden february 2008 the scientists used extremely short flashes of light called attosecond pulses which allowed an electron s motion to be observed for the first time 154 155 the distribution of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy arpes this technique employs the photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal space a mathematical representation of periodic structures that is used to infer the original structure arpes can be used to determine the direction speed and scattering of electrons within the material 156 plasma applications edit particle beams edit during a nasa wind tunnel test a model of the space shuttle is targeted by a beam of electrons simulating the effect of ionizing gases during re-entry 157 electron beams are used in welding 158 they allow energy densities up to 7007100000000000000 107 w cm 2 across a narrow focus diameter of 0.1 1.3 mm and usually require no filler material this welding technique must be performed in a vacuum to prevent the electrons from interacting with the gas before reaching their target and it can be used to join conductive materials that would otherwise be considered unsuitable for welding 159 160 electron-beam lithography ebl is a method of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer 161 this technique is limited by high costs slow performance the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids the last problem limits the resolution to about 10 nm for this reason ebl is primarily used for the production of small numbers of specialized integrated circuits 162 electron beam processing is used to irradiate materials in order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products 163 electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation e g intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy 164 linear particle accelerators generate electron beams for treatment of superficial tumors in radiation therapy electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed typically up to 5 cm for electron energies in the range 5 20 mev an electron beam can be used to supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by x-rays 165 166 particle accelerators use electric fields to propel electrons and their antiparticles to high energies these particles emit synchrotron radiation as they pass through magnetic fields the dependency of the intensity of this radiation upon spin polarizes the electron beam a process known as the sokolov ternov effect note 8 polarized electron beams can be useful for various experiments synchrotron radiation can also cool the electron beams to reduce the momentum spread of the particles electron and positron beams are collided upon the particles accelerating to the required energies particle detectors observe the resulting energy emissions which particle physics studies 167 imaging edit low-energy electron diffraction leed is a method of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine the structure of the material the required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20 200 ev 168 the reflection high-energy electron diffraction rheed technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials the beam energy is typically in the range 8 20 kev and the angle of incidence is 1 4 169 170 the electron microscope directs a focused beam of electrons at a specimen some electrons change their properties such as movement direction angle and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material 171 in blue light conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200 nm 172 by comparison electron microscopes are limited by the de broglie wavelength of the electron this wavelength for example is equal to 0.0037 nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential 173 the transmission electron aberration-corrected microscope is capable of sub-0.05 nm resolution which is more than enough to resolve individual atoms 174 this capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging however electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain two main types of electron microscopes exist transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopes function like overhead projectors with a beam of electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge-coupled device scanning electron microscopes rasteri a finely focused electron beam as in a tv set across the studied sample to produce the image magnifications range from 100 to 1,000,000 or higher for both microscope types the scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface 175 176 177 other applications edit in the free-electron laser fel a relativistic electron beam passes through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions the electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency fel can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation with a wide range of frequencies from microwaves to soft x-rays these devices are used in manufacturing communication and in medical applications such as soft tissue surgery 178 electrons are important in cathode ray tubes which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments computer monitors and television sets 179 in a photomultiplier tube every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse 180 vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals and they played a critical role in the development of electronics technology however they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices
