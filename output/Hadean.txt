the earth predating the archean it began with the formation of the earth about 4.6 billion years ago and ended as defined by the ics 4 billion years ago 1 as of 2016 the ics describes its status as informal 2 the geologist preston cloud coined the term in 1972 originally to label the period before the earliest-known rocks on earth w brian harland later coined an almost synonymous term the priscoan period other older texts simply refer to the eon as the pre-archean artist s impression of a hadean landscape contents 1 etymology 2 subdivisions 3 hadean rocks 4 atmosphere and oceans 5 see

formed and was still very hot owing to its recent accretion the abundance of short-lived radioactive elements and frequent collisions with other solar system bodies subdivisions edit since few geological traces of this eon remain on earth there is no official subdivision however the lunar geologic timescale embraces several major divisions relating to the hadean so these are sometimes used in an informal sense to refer to the same periods of time on earth the lunar divisions are pre-nectarian from the formation of the moon s crust million years ago up to about million years ago nectarian ranging from million years ago up to about million years ago in a time when the late heavy bombardment according to that theory was in a stage of decline in 2010 an alternative scale was proposed that includes the addition of the chaotian and prenephelean eons preceding the hadean and divides the hadean into three eras with two periods each the paleohadean era consists of the hephaestean 4.5-4.4 ga and the jacobian periods 4.4-4.3 ga the mesohadean is divided into the canadian 4.3-4.2 ga and the procrustean periods 4.2-4.1 ga the neohadean is divided into the acastan 4.1-4.0 ga and the promethean periods 4.0-3.9 ga 3 as of february 2017 this has not been adopted by the iugs hadean rocks edit in the last decades of the 20th century geologists identified a few hadean rocks from western greenland northwestern canada and western australia in 2015 traces of carbon minerals interpreted as remains of biotic life were found in 4.1-billion-year-old rocks in western australia 4 5 the oldest dated zircon crystals enclosed in a metamorphosed sandstone conglomerate in the jack hills of the narryer gneiss terrane of western australia date to 4.404 0.008 ga 6 this zircon is a slight outlier with the oldest consistently-dated zircon falling closer to 4.35 ga 6 around 200 million years after the hypothesized time of the earth s formation atmosphere and oceans edit early earth hadean eon volcanism a sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed the earth 7 water molecules would have escaped earth s gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation hydrogen and helium are expected to continually escape even to the present day due to atmospheric escape part of the ancient planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the impact that created the moon which should have caused melting of one or two large regions of the earth earth s present composition suggests that there was not complete remelting as it is difficult to completely melt and mix huge rock masses 8 however a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact creating a rock vapor atmosphere around the young planet the rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy co 2 atmosphere with hydrogen and water vapor liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of 230 c 446 f because at an atmospheric pressure of above 27 atmospheres caused by the heavy co 2 atmosphere water is still liquid as cooling continued subduction and dissolving in ocean water removed most co 2 from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and mantle cycles appeared 9 studies of zircons have found that liquid water must have existed as long ago as 4.4 billion years ago very soon after the formation of the earth 10 11 12 this requires the presence of an atmosphere the cool early earth theory covers a range from about 4.4 4.0 billion years a september 2008 study of zircons found that australian hadean rock holds minerals pointing to the existence of plate tectonics as early as 4 billion years 13 14 if this is true the time when earth finished its transition from having a hot molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide to being very much like it is today can be roughly dated to about 4.0 billion years ago the actions of plate tectonics and the oceans trapped vast amounts of carbon dioxide thereby eliminating the greenhouse effect and leading to a much cooler surface temperature and the formation of solid rock and possibly even life 13 14 see also edit chaotian geology formation and evolution of the solar system hadean zircon history of earth the first sections describe the formation of the earth
