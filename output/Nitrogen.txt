first discovered and isolated by scottish physician daniel rutherford in 1772 although carl wilhelm scheele and henry cavendish had independently done so at about the same time rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first the name nitrog ne was suggested by french chemist jean-antoine-claude chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates antoine lavoisier suggested instead the name azote from the greek no life as it is an asphyxiant gas this name is instead used in many languages such as french russian and turkish and appears in the english names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine azides and azo compounds nitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table often called the pnictogens the name comes from the greek to choke directly referencing nitrogen s asphyxiating properties it is a common element in the universe estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the milky way and the solar system at standard temperature and pressure two atoms of the element bind to form dinitrogen a colourless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula n2 dinitrogen forms about 78 of earth s atmosphere making it the most abundant uncombined element nitrogen occurs in all organisms primarily in amino acids and thus proteins in the nucleic acids dna and rna and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate the human body contains about 3 nitrogen by mass the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen carbon and hydrogen the nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from the air into the biosphere and organic compounds then back into the atmosphere many industrially important compounds such as ammonia nitric acid organic nitrates propellants and explosives and cyanides contain nitrogen the extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen n n the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide co 3 dominates nitrogen chemistry this causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting n2 into useful compounds but at the same time means that burning exploding or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems apart from its use in fertilisers and energy-stores nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class including antibiotics many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules for example the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide many notable nitrogen-containing drugs such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the

long history ammonium chloride having been known to herodotus they were well known by the middle ages alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis strong water as well as other nitrogen compounds such as ammonium salts and nitrate salts the mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia royal water celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold the king of metals 4 the discovery of nitrogen is attributed to the scottish physician daniel rutherford in 1772 who called it noxious air 5 6 though he did not recognise it as an entirely different chemical substance he clearly distinguished it from joseph black s fixed air or carbon dioxide 7 the fact that there was a component of air that does not support combustion was clear to rutherford although he was not aware that it was an element nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by carl wilhelm scheele 8 henry cavendish 9 and joseph priestley 10 who referred to it as burnt air or phlogisticated air nitrogen gas was inert enough that antoine lavoisier referred to it as mephitic air or azote from the greek word azotikos no life 11 12 in an atmosphere of pure nitrogen animals died and flames were extinguished though lavoisier s name was not accepted in english since it was pointed out that almost all gases indeed with the sole exception of oxygen are mephitic it is used in many languages french italian portuguese polish russian albanian turkish etc the german stickstoff similarly refers to the same characteristic viz sticken to choke or suffocate and still remains in english in the common names of many nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine and compounds of the azide ion finally it led to the name pnictogens for the group headed by nitrogen from the greek to choke 4 the english word nitrogen 1794 entered the language from the french nitrog ne coined in 1790 by french chemist jean-antoine chaptal 1756 1832 13 from the french nitre potassium nitrate also called saltpeter and the french suffix -g ne producing from the greek - -genes begotten chaptal s meaning was that nitrogen is the essential part of nitric acid which in turn was produced from niter in earlier times niter had been confused with egyptian natron sodium carbonate called nitron in greek which despite the name contained no nitrate 14 the earliest military industrial and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpeter sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate most notably in gunpowder and later as fertiliser in 1910 lord rayleigh discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced active nitrogen a monatomic allotrope of nitrogen 15 the whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light produced by his apparatus reacted with mercury to produce explosive mercury nitride 16 for a long time sources of nitrogen compounds were limited natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the frank caro process 1895 1899 and haber bosch process 1908 1913 eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds to the extent that half of global food production see applications now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers 17 at the same time use of the ostwald process 1902 to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the world wars of the 20th century 18 19 properties atomic the shapes of the five orbitals occupied in nitrogen the two colours show the phase or sign of the wave function in each region from left to right 1s 2s cutaway to show internal structure 2p x 2p y 2p z a nitrogen atom has seven electrons in the ground state they are arranged in the electron configuration 1s2 2s2 2p1 x2p1 y2p1 z it therefore has five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals three of which the p-electrons are unpaired it has one of the highest electronegativities among the elements 3.04 on the pauling scale exceeded only by chlorine 3.16 oxygen 3.44 and fluorine 3.98 20 following periodic trends its single-bond covalent radius of 71 pm is smaller than those of boron 84 pm and carbon 76 pm while it is larger than those of oxygen 66 pm and fluorine 57 pm the nitride anion n3 is much larger at 146 pm similar to that of the oxide o2 140 pm and fluoride f 133 pm anions 20 the first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402 2.856 and 4.577 mj mol 1 and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920 mj mol 1 due to these very high figures nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry 21 the lack of radial nodes in the 2p subshell is directly responsible for many of the anomalous properties of the first row of the p-block especially in nitrogen oxygen and fluorine the 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell facilitating orbital hybridisation it also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells resulting in very high electronegativities hypervalency is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason because the high electronegativity makes it difficult for a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich three-center four-electron bond since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself thus despite nitrogen s position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth 22 nitrogen may be usefully compared to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen as well as its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur known as the diagonal relationships their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron silicon pair so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons it does not share carbon s proclivity for catenation with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms phn n n ph n n n ph n nph one property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds typically with carbon nitrogen or oxygen atoms through p p interactions thus for example nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower melting 210 c and boiling points 196 c than the rest of its group as the n2 molecules are only held together by weak van der waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles this is not possible for its vertical neighbours thus the nitrogen oxides nitrites nitrates nitro- nitroso- azo- and diazo-compounds azides cyanates thiocyanates and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus arsenic antimony or bismuth by the same token however the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen 23 isotopes table of nuclides segr chart from carbon to fluorine including nitrogen orange indicates proton emission nuclides outside the proton drip line pink for positron emission inverse beta decay black for stable nuclides blue for electron emission beta decay and violet for neutron emission nuclides outside the neutron drip line proton number increases going up the vertical axis and neutron number going to the right on the horizontal axis nitrogen has two stable isotopes 14n and 15n the first is much more common making up 99.634 of natural nitrogen and the second which is slightly heavier makes up the remaining 0.366 this leads to an atomic weight of around 14.007 u 20 both of these stable isotopes are produced in the cno cycle in stars but 14n is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step 14n is one of the five stable odd odd nuclides a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons the other four are 2h 6li 10b and 180mta 24 the relative abundance of 14n and 15n is practically constant in the atmosphere but can vary elsewhere due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox reactions and the evaporation of natural ammonia or nitric acid 25 biologically mediated reactions e g assimilation nitrification and denitrification strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil these reactions typically result in 15n enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product 26 the heavy isotope 15n was first discovered by s m naud in 1929 soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered 27 it presents one of the lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes 28 it is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half which offers advantages for nmr such as narrower line width 14n though also theoretically usable has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra 20 15n nmr nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy the low natural abundance of 15n 0.36 significantly reduces sensitivity a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio only 10.14 that of 1h as a result the signal-to-noise ratio for 1h is about 300 times as much as that for 15n at the same magnetic field strength 29 this may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15n by chemical exchange or fractional distillation 15n-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen carbon and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere 20 the 15n 14n ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry hydrology paleoclimatology and paleoceanography where it is called 15n 30 of the ten other isotopes produced synthetically ranging from 12n to 23n 13n has a half-life of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half-lives on the order of seconds 16n and 17n or even milliseconds no other nitrogen isotopes are possible as they would fall outside the nuclear drip lines leaking out a proton or neutron 31 given the half-life difference 13n is the most important nitrogen radioisotope being relatively long-lived enough to use in positron emission tomography pet although its half-life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the pet for example in a cyclotron via proton bombardment of 16o producing 13n and an alpha particle 32 the radioisotope 16n is the dominant radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle and is the primary means of detection for such leaks it is produced from 16o in water via an n p reaction in which the 16o atom captures a neutron and expels a proton it has a short half-life of about 7.1 s 31 but during its decay back to 16o produces high-energy gamma radiation 5 to 7 mev 31 33 because of this access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation 33 chemistry and compounds allotropes molecular orbital diagram of dinitrogen molecule n 2 there are five bonding orbitals and two antibonding orbitals marked with an asterisk giving a total bond order of three atomic nitrogen also known as active nitrogen is highly reactive being a triradical with three unpaired electrons free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited n2 molecule they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as co and o or oh and h atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1 2 mmhg which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates 23 given the great reactivity of atomic nitrogen elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular n2 dinitrogen this molecule is a colourless odourless and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions it melts at 210 c and boils at 196 c 23 dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature but it will nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes this is due to its bonding which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an n n triple bond triple bonds have short bond lengths in this case 109.76 pm and high dissociation energies in this case 945.41 kj mol and are thus very strong explaining dinitrogen s chemical inertness 23 there are some theoretical indications that other nitrogen oligomers and polymers may be possible if they could be synthesised they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density that could be used as powerful propellants or explosives 34 this is because they should all decompose to dinitrogen whose n n triple bond bond energy 946 kj mol 1 is much stronger than those of the n n double bond 418 kj mol 1 or the n n single bond 160 kj mol 1 indeed the triple bond has more than thrice the energy of the single bond the opposite is true for the heavier pnictogens which prefer polyatomic allotropes 35 a great disadvantage is that most neutral polynitrogens are not expected to have a large barrier towards decomposition and that the few exceptions would be even more challenging to synthesise than the long-sought but still unknown tetrahedrane this stands in contrast to the well-characterised cationic and anionic polynitrogens azide n 3 pentazenium n 5 and pentazolide cyclic aromatic n 5 34 under extremely high pressures 1.1 million atm and high temperatures 2000 k as produced in a diamond anvil cell nitrogen polymerises into the single-bonded cubic gauche crystal structure this structure is similar to that of diamond and both have extremely strong covalent bonds resulting in its nickname nitrogen diamond 36 solid nitrogen on the plains of sputnik planitia on pluto next to water ice mountains at atmospheric pressure molecular nitrogen condenses liquefies at 77 k 195.79 c and freezes at 63 k 210.01 c 37 into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form below 35.4 k 237.6 c nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form called the alpha phase 38 liquid nitrogen a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance but with 80.8 of the density the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808 g ml is a common cryogen 39 solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications it forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on pluto 40 and outer moons of the solar system such as triton 41 even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere or condense back into nitrogen frost it is very weak and flows in the form of glaciers and on triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region 42 dinitrogen complexes structure of ru nh 3 5 n 2 2 pentaamine dinitrogen ruthenium ii the first dinitrogen complex to be discovered the first example of a dinitrogen complex to be discovered was ru nh3 5 n2 2 see figure at right and soon many other such complexes were discovered these complexes in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one lone pair of electrons to a central metal cation illustrate how n2 might bind to the metal s in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the haber process these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of fertilisers 43 44 dinitrogen is able to coordinate to metals in five different ways the more well-characterised ways are the end-on m n n 1 and m n n m bis- 1 in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation the less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond either as a bridging ligand to two metal cations bis- 2 or to just one 2 the fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond 3-n2 a few complexes feature multiple n2 ligands and some feature n2 bonded in multiple ways since n2 is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide co and acetylene c2h2 the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in carbonyl compounds although n2 is a weaker -donor and -acceptor than co theoretical studies show that donation is a more important factor allowing the formation of the m n bond than back-donation which mostly only weakens the n n bond and end-on 1 donation is more readily accomplished than side-on 2 donation 23 today dinitrogen complexes are known for almost all the transition metals accounting for several hundred compounds they are normally prepared by three methods 23 replacing labile ligands such as h2o h or co directly by nitrogen these are often reversible reactions that proceed at mild conditions reducing metal complexes in the presence of a suitable coligand in excess under nitrogen gas a common choice include replacing chloride ligands by dimethylphenylphosphine pme2ph to make up for the smaller number of nitrogen ligands attached than the original chlorine ligands converting a ligand with n n bonds such as hydrazine or azide directly into a dinitrogen ligand occasionally the n n bond may be formed directly within a metal complex for example by directly reacting coordinated ammonia nh3 with nitrous acid hno2 but this is not generally applicable most dinitrogen complexes have colours within the range white-yellow-orange-red-brown a few exceptions are known such as the blue ti 5-c5h5 2 2- n2 23 nitrides azides and nitrido complexes nitrogen bonds to almost all the elements in the periodic table except the first three noble gases helium neon and argon and some of the very short-lived elements after bismuth creating an immense variety of binary compounds with varying properties and applications 23 many binary compounds are known with the exception of the nitrogen hydrides oxides and fluorides these are typically called nitrides many stoichiometric phases are usually present for most elements e g mnn mn6n5 mn3n2 mn2n mn4n and mnxn for 9.2 x 25.3 they may be classified as salt-like mostly ionic covalent diamond-like and metallic or interstitial although this classification has limitations generally stemming from the continuity of bonding types instead of the discrete and separate types that it implies they are normally prepared by directly reacting a metal with nitrogen or ammonia sometimes after heating or by thermal decomposition of metal amides 45 3 ca n 2 ca 3n 2 3 mg 2 nh 3 mg 3n 2 3 h 2 at 900 c 3 zn nh 2 2 zn 3n 2 4 nh 3 many variants on these processes are possible the most ionic of these nitrides are those of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals li3n na k rb and cs do not form stable nitrides for steric reasons and m3n2 m be mg ca sr ba these can formally be thought of as salts of the n3 anion although charge separation is not actually complete even for these highly electropositive elements however the alkali metal azides nan3 and kn3 featuring the linear n 3 anion are well-known as are sr n3 2 and ba n3 2 azides of the b-subgroup metals those in groups 11 through 16 are much less ionic have more complicated structures and detonate readily when shocked 45 mesomeric structures of borazine bh nh 3 many covalent binary nitrides are known examples include cyanogen cn 2 triphosphorus pentanitride p3n5 disulfur dinitride s2n2 and tetrasulfur tetranitride s4n4 the essentially covalent silicon nitride si3n4 and germanium nitride ge3n4 are also known silicon nitride in particular would make a promising ceramic if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it in particular the group 13 nitrides most of which are promising semiconductors are isoelectronic with graphite diamond and silicon carbide and have similar structures their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended in particular since the b n unit is isoelectronic to c c and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron nitrogen chemistry such as in borazine inorganic benzene nevertheless the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring 45 the largest category of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae mn m2n and m4n although variable composition is perfectly possible where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned in the gaps in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice they are opaque very hard and chemically inert melting only at very high temperatures generally over 2500 c they have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals they hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen 45 the nitride anion n3 is the strongest donor known amongst ligands the second-strongest is o2 nitrido complexes are generally made by thermal decomposition of azides or by deprotonating ammonia and they usually involve a terminal n 3 group the linear azide anion n 3 being isoelectronic with nitrous oxide carbon dioxide and cyanate forms many coordination complexes further catenation is rare although n4 4 isoelectronic with carbonate and nitrate is known 45 hydrides standard reduction potentials for nitrogen-containing species top diagram shows potentials at ph 0 bottom diagram shows potentials at ph 14 46 industrially ammonia nh3 is the most important compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers it is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell the presence of hydrogen bonding has very significant effects on ammonia conferring on it its high melting 78 c and boiling 33 c points as a liquid it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant and is less dense than water however the hydrogen bonding in nh3 is weaker than that in h2o due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in nh3 rather than two in h2o it is a weak base in aqueous solution pkb 4.74 its conjugate acid is ammonium nh 4 it can also act as an extremely weak acid losing a proton to produce the amide anion nh 2 it thus undergoes self-dissociation similar to water to produce ammonium and amide ammonia burns in air or oxygen though not readily to produce nitrogen gas it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give nitrogen trifluoride reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides 47 many other binary nitrogen hydrides are known but the most important are hydrazine n2h4 and hydrogen azide hn3 although it is not a nitrogen hydride hydroxylamine nh2oh is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well hydrazine is a fuming colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia its physical properties are very similar to those of water melting point 2.0 c boiling point 113.5 c density 1.00 g cm 3 despite it being an endothermic compound it is kinetically stable it burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour it is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia 48 it is also commonly used as a rocket fuel 49 hydrazine is generally made by reaction of ammonia with alkaline sodium hypochlorite in the presence of gelatin or glue 48 nh 3 ocl nh 2cl oh nh 2cl nh 3 n 2h 5 cl slow n 2h 5 oh n 2h 4 h 2o fast the attacks by hydroxide and ammonia may be reversed thus passing through the intermediate nhcl instead the reason for adding gelatin is that it removes metal ions such as cu2 that catalyses the destruction of hydrazine by reaction with chloramine nh2cl to produce ammonium chloride and nitrogen 48 hydrogen azide hn3 was first produced in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid it is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous it has a disagreeable and irritating smell and is a potentially lethal but not cumulative poison it may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids 48 halides and oxohalides nitrogen trichloride all four simple nitrogen trihalides are known a few mixed halides and hydrohalides are known but are mostly unstable and uninteresting examples include nclf2 ncl2f nbrf2 nf2h ncl2h and nclh2 50 five nitrogen fluorides are known nitrogen trifluoride nf3 first prepared in 1928 is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable and most readily produced by the electrolysis of molten ammonium fluoride dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride like carbon tetrafluoride it is not at all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent and it reacts with copper arsenic antimony and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give tetrafluorohydrazine n2f4 the cations nf 4 and n 2f 3 are also known the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as arsenic pentafluoride as is onf3 which has aroused interest due to the short n o distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long n f bond tetrafluorohydrazine unlike hydrazine itself can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical nf2 fluorine azide fn3 is very explosive and thermally unstable dinitrogen difluoride n2f2 exists as thermally interconvertible cis and trans isomers and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of fn3 50 nitrogen trichloride ncl3 is a dense volatile and explosive liquid whose physical properties are similar to those of carbon tetrachloride although one difference is that ncl3 is easily hydrolysed by water while ccl4 is not it was first synthesised in 1811 by pierre louis dulong who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies as a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour nitrogen tribromide nbr3 first prepared in 1975 is a deep red temperature-sensitive volatile solid that is explosive even at 100 c nitrogen triiodide ni3 is still more unstable and was only prepared in 1990 its adduct with ammonia which was known earlier is very shock-sensitive it can be set off by the touch of a feather shifting air currents or even alpha particles 50 51 for this reason small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesised as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of chemical magic 52 two series of nitrogen oxohalides are known the nitrosyl halides xno and the nitryl halides xno2 the first are very reactive gases that can be made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide nitrosyl fluoride nof is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent nitrosyl chloride nocl behaves in much the same way and has often been used as an ionising solvent nitrosyl bromide nobr is red the reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar nitryl fluoride fno2 and nitryl chloride clno2 are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents 50 oxides nitrogen dioxide at 196 c 0 c 23 c 35 c and 50 c no 2 converts to colourless dinitrogen tetroxide n 2o 4 at low temperatures and reverts to no

yet been synthesised is oxatetrazole n4o an aromatic ring 53 nitrous oxide n2o better known as laughing gas is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250 c this is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts it is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic despite appearances it cannot be considered to be the anhydride of hyponitrous acid h2n2o2 because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water it is rather unreactive not reacting with the halogens the alkali metals or ozone at room temperature although reactivity increases upon heating and has the unsymmetrical structure n n o n n o n n o above 600 c it dissociates by breaking the weaker n o bond 53 nitric oxide no is the simplest stable molecule with an odd number of electrons in mammals including humans it is an important cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes 55 it is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia it is a colourless paramagnetic gas that being thermodynamically unstable decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100 1200 c its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen but one extra electron is added to a antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5 hence dimerisation to o n n o is unfavourable except below the boiling point where the cis isomer is more stable because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the no molecule granting it stability there is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer o n o n when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules it reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides it also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes most of which are deeply coloured 53 blue dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 is only available as a solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide nitrogen dioxide no2 and dinitrogen tetroxide n2o4 the latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant nitrogen dioxide is an acrid corrosive brown gas both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate both react with water to form nitric acid dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the united states and ussr by the late 1950s this is because it is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature 53 the thermally unstable and very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide n2o5 is the anhydride of nitric acid and can be made from it by dehydration with phosphorus pentoxide it is of interest for the preparation of explosives 56 it is a deliquescent colourless crystalline solid that is sensitive to light in the solid state it is ionic with structure no2 no3 as a gas and in solution it is molecular o2n o no2 hydration to nitric acid comes readily as does analogous reaction with hydrogen peroxide giving peroxonitric acid hoono2 it is a violent oxidising agent gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows 53 n 2o 5 no 2 no 3 no 2 o 2 no n 2o 5 no 3 no 2 oxoacids oxoanions and oxoacid salts many nitrogen oxoacids are known though most of them are unstable as pure compounds and are known only as aqueous solution or as salts hyponitrous acid h2n2o2 is a weak diprotic acid with the structure hon noh pka1 6.9 pka2 11.6 acidic solutions are quite stable but above ph 4 base-catalysed decomposition occurs via honno to nitrous oxide and the hydroxide anion hyponitrites involving the n 2o2 2 anion are stable to reducing agents and more commonly act as reducing agents themselves they are an intermediate step in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite which occurs in the nitrogen cycle hyponitrite can act as a bridging or chelating bidentate ligand 57 nitrous acid hno2 is not known as a pure compound but is a common component in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous nitrite no 2 bent solutions although already at room temperature disproportionation to nitrate and nitric oxide is significant it is a weak acid with pka 3.35 at 18 c they may be titrimetrically analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by permanganate they are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by sulfur dioxide to hyponitrous acid with tin ii and to ammonia with hydrogen sulfide salts of hydrazinium n 2h 5 react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen sodium nitrite is mildly toxic in concentrations above 100 mg kg but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage it is also used to synthesise hydroxylamine and to diazotise primary aromatic amines as follows 57 arnh 2 hno 2 arnn cl 2 h 2o nitrite is also a common ligand that can coordinate in five ways the most common are nitro bonded from the nitrogen and nitrito bonded from an oxygen nitro-nitrito isomerism is common where the nitrito form is usually less stable 57 fuming nitric acid contaminated with yellow nitrogen dioxide nitric acid hno3 is by far the most important and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids it is one of the three most used acids the other two being sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid and was first discovered by the alchemists in the 13th century it is made by catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid in the united states of america over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives among other uses anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with phosphorus pentoxide at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark it can only be made in the solid state because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide and liquid nitric acid undergoes self-ionisation to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows 57 2 hno 3 h 2no 3 no 3 h 2o no 2 no 3 two hydrates hno3 h2o and hno3 3h2o are known that can be crystallised it is a strong acid and concentrated solutions are strong oxidising agents though gold platinum rhodium and iridium are immune to attack a 3 1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid called aqua regia is still stronger and successfully dissolves gold and platinum because free chlorine and nitrosyl chloride are formed and chloride anions can form strong complexes in concentrated sulfuric acid nitric acid is protonated to form nitronium which can act as an electrophile for aromatic nitration 57 hno 3 2 h 2so 4 no 2 h 3o 2 hso 4 the thermal stabilities of nitrates involving the trigonal planar no 3 anion depends on the basicity of the metal and so do the products of decomposition thermolysis which can vary between the nitrite for example sodium the oxide potassium and lead or even the metal itself silver depending on their relative stabilities nitrate is also a common ligand with many modes of coordination 57 finally although orthonitric acid h3no4 which would be analogous to orthophosphoric acid does not exist the tetrahedral orthonitrate anion no3 4 is known in its sodium and potassium salts 57 nano 3 na 2 o 300 c for 7 days ag crucible na 3 no 4 displaystyle ce nano3 na2o- ce ag crucible ce 300 circ c for 7days na3no4 these white crystalline salts are very sensitive to water vapour and carbon dioxide in the air 57 na 3no 4 h 2o co 2 nano 3 naoh nahco 3 despite its limited chemistry the orthonitrate anion is interesting from a structural point of view due to its regular tetrahedral shape and the short n o bond lengths implying significant polar character to the bonding 57 organic nitrogen compounds nitrogen is one of the most important elements in organic chemistry many organic functional groups involve a carbon nitrogen bond such as amides rconr2 amines r3n imines rc nr r imides rco 2nr azides rn3 azo compounds rn2r cyanates and isocyanates rocn or rcno nitrates rono2 nitriles and isonitriles rcn or rnc nitrites rono nitro compounds rno2 nitroso compounds rno oximes rcr noh and pyridine derivatives c n bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen in these compounds nitrogen is usually trivalent though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts r4n with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton this may be offset by other factors for example amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond though they may act as acids at very low ph being protonated at the oxygen and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring 58 the amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the kjeldahl method 59 in particular nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids amino acids and thus proteins and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on earth 58 occurrence schematic representation of the flow of nitrogen compounds through a land environment nitrogen is the most common pure element in the earth making up 78.1 of the entire volume of the atmosphere 4 despite this it is not very abundant in earth s crust making up only 19 parts per million of this on par with niobium gallium and lithium the only important nitrogen minerals are nitre potassium nitrate saltpetre and sodanitre sodium nitrate chilean saltpetre however these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common 60 nitrogen compounds constantly interchange between the atmosphere and living organisms nitrogen must first be processed or fixed into a plant-usable form usually ammonia some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides but most is done by diazotrophic bacteria through enzymes known as nitrogenases although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant when the ammonia is taken up by plants it is used to synthesise proteins these plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their own proteins and excrete nitrogen bearing waste finally these organisms die and decompose undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and denitrification returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere industrial nitrogen fixation by the haber process is mostly used as fertiliser although excess nitrogen bearing waste when leached leads to eutrophication of freshwater and the creation of marine dead zones as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die furthermore nitrous oxide which is produced during denitrification attacks the atmospheric ozone layer 60 many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of trimethylamine oxide to protect them from the high osmotic effects of their environment conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater fish 61 in animals free radical nitric oxide derived from an amino acid serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation 62 nitric oxide s rapid reaction with water in animals results in production of its metabolite nitrite animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins in general results in excretion of urea while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid the characteristic odour of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long-chain nitrogen-containing amines such as putrescine and cadaverine which are breakdown products of the amino acids ornithine and lysine respectively in decaying proteins 63 production nitrogen gas is an industrial gas produced by the fractional distillation of liquid air or by mechanical means using gaseous air pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption psa are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen 64 commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes when supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called ofn oxygen-free nitrogen 65 commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20 ppm oxygen and specially purified grades containing at most 2 ppm oxygen and 10 ppm argon are also available 66 in a chemical laboratory it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride with sodium nitrite 67 nh 4cl nano 2 n 2 nacl 2 h 2o small amounts of the impurities no and hno3 are also formed in this reaction the impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate 67 very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or sodium azide 68 2 nan 3 2 na 3 n 2 applications gas the applications of nitrogen compounds are naturally extremely widely varied due to the huge size of this class hence only applications of pure nitrogen itself will be considered here two-thirds of nitrogen produced by industry is sold as the gas and the remaining one-third as the liquid the gas is mostly used as an inert atmosphere whenever the oxygen in the air would pose a fire explosion or oxidising hazard some examples include 66 as a modified atmosphere pure or mixed with carbon dioxide to nitrogenate and preserve the freshness of packaged or bulk foods by delaying rancidity and other forms of oxidative damage pure nitrogen as food additive is labeled in the european union with the e number e941 69 in incandescent light bulbs as an inexpensive alternative to argon 70 in fire suppression systems for information technology it equipment 66 in the manufacture of stainless steel 71 in the case-hardening of steel by nitriding 72 in some aircraft fuel systems to reduce fire hazard see inerting system 73 to inflate race car and aircraft tires 74 reducing the problems caused by moisture and oxygen in natural air 66 nitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation in chemical analysis it is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples directing a pressurised stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid causes the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute s and un-evaporated solvent behind 75 nitrogen can be used as a replacement or in combination with carbon dioxide to pressurise kegs of some beers particularly stouts and british ales due to the smaller bubbles it produces which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier 76 a pressure-sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a widget allows nitrogen-charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles 77 78 nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns nitrogen must be kept at higher pressure than co2 making n2 tanks heavier and more expensive 79 nitrogen gas has become the inert gas of choice for inert gas asphyxiation and is under consideration as a replacement for lethal injection in oklahoma 80 81 nitrogen gas formed from the decomposition of sodium azide is used for the inflation of airbags 82 liquid play media air balloon submerged in liquid nitrogen liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid when insulated in proper containers such as dewar flasks it can be transported without much evaporative loss 83 like dry ice the main use of liquid nitrogen is as a refrigerant among other things it is used in the cryopreservation of blood reproductive cells sperm and egg and other biological samples and materials it is used in the clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin 84 it is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or x-ray detectors it has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked and that produce more heat than during normal operation 85 other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary around 200 c because of its low cost liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary such as refrigeration of food freeze-branding livestock freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath 66 safety gas although nitrogen is non-toxic when released into an enclosed space it can displace oxygen and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard this may happen with few warning symptoms since the human carotid body is a relatively poor and slow low-oxygen hypoxia sensing system 86 an example occurred shortly before the launch of the first space shuttle mission in 1981 when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the shuttle s mobile launcher platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire 87 when inhaled at high partial pressures more than about 4 bar encountered at depths below about 30 m in scuba diving nitrogen is an anesthetic agent causing nitrogen narcosis a temporary state of mental impairment similar to nitrous oxide intoxication 88 89 nitrogen dissolves in the blood and body fats rapid decompression as when divers ascend too quickly or astronauts decompress too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure can lead to a potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness formerly known as caisson sickness or the bends when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream nerves joints and other sensitive or vital areas 90 91 bubbles from other inert gases gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen cause the same effects so replacement of nitrogen in breathing gases may prevent nitrogen narcosis but does not prevent decompression sickness 92 liquid as a cryogenic liquid liquid nitrogen can be dangerous by causing cold burns on contact although the leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure about one second 93 ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage for example in 2012 a young woman in england had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen 94 because the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio of nitrogen is 1 694 at 20 c a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space in an incident on january 12 2006 at texas a m university the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed as a result of the subsequent pressure buildup the tank failed catastrophically the force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1 0.2 m off their foundations 95 liquid nitrogen readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen and hence the precautions associated with gaseous nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen 96 97 98 for example oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space 99 vessels containing liquid nitrogen can condense oxygen from air the liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen boiling point 183 c higher than that of nitrogen as the nitrogen evaporates and can cause violent oxidation of organic material 100 see also reactive
