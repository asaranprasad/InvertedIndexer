wavelengths shorter than visible light different applications use different parts of the x-ray spectrum x-rays make up x-radiation a form of electromagnetic radiation most x-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz 3 1016 hz to 3 1019 hz and energies in the range 100 ev to 100 kev x-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of uv rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays in many languages x-radiation is referred to with terms meaning r ntgen radiation after the german scientist wilhelm r ntgen

the first to systematically study them though he is not the first to have observed their effects he is also the one who gave them the name x-rays signifying an unknown quantity 4 though many others referred to these as r ntgen rays and the associated x-ray radiograms as r ntgenograms for several decades after their discovery and even to this day in some languages including r ntgen s native german hand mit ringen hand with rings print of wilhelm r ntgen s first medical x-ray of his wife s hand taken on 22 december 1895 and presented to ludwig zehnder of the physik institut university of freiburg on 1 january 1896 5 6 x-rays were found emanating from crookes tubes experimental discharge tubes invented around 1875 by scientists investigating the cathode rays that is energetic electron beams that were first created in the tubes crookes tubes created free electrons by ionization of the residual air in the tube by a high dc voltage of anywhere between a few kilovolts and 100 kv this voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the cathode to a high enough velocity that they created x-rays when they struck the anode or the glass wall of the tube many of the early crookes tubes undoubtedly radiated x-rays because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them as detailed below wilhelm r ntgen was the first to systematically study them in 1895 7 the discovery of x-rays stimulated a veritable sensation r ntgen s biographer otto glasser estimated that in 1896 alone as many as 49 essays and 1044 articles about the new rays were published 8 this was probably a conservative estimate if one considers that nearly every paper around the world extensively reported about the new discovery with a magazine such as science dedicating as many as 23 articles to it in that year alone 9 sensationalist reactions to the new discovery included publications linking the new kind of rays to occult and paranormal theories such as telepathy 10 11 early research edit pulyui s x-ray images the earliest experimenter thought to have unknowingly produce x-rays was actuary william morgan in 1785 he presented a paper to the royal society of london describing the effects of passing electrical currents through a partially evacuated glass tube producing a glow created by x-rays 12 this work was further explored by humphry davy and his assistant michael faraday in 1877 ukrainian-born ivan pulyui a lecturer in experimental physics at the university of vienna constructed various designs of vacuum discharge tube to investigate their properties 13 he continued his investigations when appointed professor at the prague polytechnic and in 1886 he found that sealed photographic plates became dark when exposed to the emanations from the tubes early in 1896 just a few weeks after r ntgen published his first x-ray photograph pulyui published high-quality x-ray images in journals in paris and london 13 although pulyui had studied with r ntgen at the university of strasbourg in the years 1873 75 his biographer gaida 1997 asserts that his subsequent research was conducted independently 13 taking an x-ray image with early crookes tube apparatus late 1800s the crookes tube is visible in center the standing man is viewing his hand with a fluoroscope screen the seated man is taking a radiograph of his hand by placing it on a photographic plate no precautions against radiation exposure are taken its hazards were not known at the time x-rays were generated and detected by fernando sanford 1854 1948 the foundation professor of physics at stanford university in 1891 from 1886 to 1888 he had studied in the hermann helmholtz laboratory in berlin where he became familiar with the cathode rays generated in vacuum tubes when a voltage was applied across separate electrodes as previously studied by heinrich hertz and philipp lenard his letter of january 6 1893 describing his discovery as electric photography to the physical review was duly published and an article entitled without lens or light photographs taken with plate and object in darkness appeared in the san francisco examiner 14 starting in 1888 philipp lenard a student of heinrich hertz conducted experiments to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the crookes tube into the air he built a crookes tube later called a lenard tube with a window in the end made of thin aluminum facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it he found that something came through that would expose photographic plates and cause fluorescence he measured the penetrating power of these rays through various materials it has been suggested that at least some of these lenard rays were actually x-rays 15 hermann von helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for x-rays he postulated a dispersion theory before r ntgen made his discovery and announcement it was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light 16 however he did not work with actual x-rays in 1894 nikola tesla noticed damaged film in his lab that seemed to be associated with crookes tube experiments and began investigating this radiant energy of invisible kinds 17 18 after r ntgen identified the x-ray tesla began making x-ray images of his own using high voltages and tubes of his own design 19 as well as crookes tubes in november 1896 the inventor dr robert d unger proposed a x-ray telephot supposed able to make transmission of pictures by telegraph wire 20 wilhelm r ntgen edit 1896 plaque published in nouvelle iconographie de la salpetri re a medical journal in the left a hand deformity in the right same hand seen using radiography the authors designated the technique as r ntgen photography on november 8 1895 german physics professor wilhelm r ntgen stumbled on x-rays while experimenting with lenard and crookes tubes and began studying them he wrote an initial report on a new kind of ray a preliminary communication and on december 28 1895 submitted it to w rzburg s physical-medical society journal 21 this was the first paper written on x-rays r ntgen referred to the radiation as x to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation the name stuck although over r ntgen s great objections many of his colleagues suggested calling them r ntgen rays they are still referred to as such in many languages including german hungarian danish polish swedish finnish estonian russian japanese dutch and norwegian r ntgen received the first nobel prize in physics for his discovery 22 there are conflicting accounts of his discovery because r ntgen had his lab notes burned after his death but this is a likely reconstruction by his biographers 23 24 r ntgen was investigating cathode rays from a crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide he noticed a faint green glow from the screen about 1 meter away r ntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow he found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk r ntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically two months after his initial discovery he published his paper citation needed r ntgen discovered their medical use when he made a picture of his wife s hand on a photographic plate formed due to x-rays the photograph of his wife s hand was the first photograph of a human body part using x-rays when she saw the picture she said i have seen my death 25 advances in radiology edit a simplified diagram of a water-cooled x-ray tube there was immediate interest from researchers for the x-ray a a campbell swinton nikola tesla were amongst the firsts to test the new discovery in 1896 thomas edison investigated materials ability to fluoresce when exposed to x-rays and found that calcium tungstate was the most effective substance around march 1896 the fluoroscope he developed became the standard for medical x-ray examinations nevertheless edison dropped x-ray research around 1903 even before the death of clarence madison dally one of his glassblowers dally had a habit of testing x-ray tubes on his hands and acquired a cancer in them so tenacious that both arms were amputated in a futile attempt to save his life the first use of x-rays under clinical conditions was by john hall-edwards in birmingham england on 11 january 1896 when he radiographed a needle stuck in the hand of an associate 26 on 14 february 1896 hall-edwards was also the first to use x-rays in a surgical operation 27 in early 1896 several weeks after r ntgen s discovery ivan romanovich tarkhanov irradiated frogs and insects with x-rays concluding that the rays not only photograph but also affect the living function 28 the first medical x-ray made in the united states was obtained using a discharge tube of pulyui s design in january 1896 on reading of r ntgen s discovery frank austin of dartmouth college tested all of the discharge tubes in the physics laboratory and found that only the pulyui tube produced x-rays this was a result of pulyui s inclusion of an oblique target of mica used for holding samples of fluorescent material within the tube on 3 february 1896 gilman frost professor of medicine at the college and his brother edwin frost professor of physics exposed the wrist of eddie mccarthy whom gilman had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture to the x-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on gelatin photographic plates obtained from howard langill a local photographer also interested in r ntgen s work 29 in 1901 u s president william mckinley was shot twice in an assassination attempt while one bullet only grazed his sternum another had lodged somewhere deep inside his abdomen and could not be found a worried mckinley aide sent word to inventor thomas edison to rush an x-ray machine to buffalo to find the stray bullet it arrived but wasn t used while the shooting itself had not been lethal gangrene had developed along the path of the bullet and mckinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection six days later 30 hazards discovered edit with the widespread experimentation with x rays after their discovery in 1895 by scientists physicians and inventors came many stories of burns hair loss and worse in technical journals of the time in february 1896 professor john daniel and dr william lofland dudley of vanderbilt university reported hair loss after dr dudley was x-rayed a child who had been shot in the head was brought to the vanderbilt laboratory in 1896 before trying to find the bullet an experiment was attempted for which dudley with his characteristic devotion to science 31 32 33 volunteered daniel reported that 21 days after taking a picture of dudley s skull with an exposure time of one hour he noticed a bald spot 2 inches 5.1 cm in diameter on the part of his head nearest the x-ray tube a plate holder with the plates towards the side of the skull was fastened and a coin placed between the skull and the head the tube was fastened at the other side at a distance of one-half inch from the hair 34 in august 1896 dr hd hawks a graduate of columbia college suffered severe hand and chest burns from an x-ray demonstration it was reported in electrical review and led to many other reports of problems associated with x-rays being sent in to the publication 35 many experimenters including elihu thomson at edison s lab william j morton and nikola tesla also reported burns elihu thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an x-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain swelling and blistering 36 other effects were sometimes blamed for the damage including ultraviolet rays and according to tesla ozone 37 many physicians claimed there were no effects from x-ray exposure at all 36 on august 3 1905 at san francisco california elizabeth fleischman american woman x-ray pioneer died from complications as a result of her work with x-rays 38 39 40 20th century and beyond edit a patient being examined with a thoracic fluoroscope in 1940 which displayed continuous moving images this image was used to argue that radiation exposure during the x-ray procedure would be negligible the many applications of x-rays immediately generated enormous interest workshops began making specialized versions of crookes tubes for generating x-rays and these first-generation cold cathode or crookes x-ray tubes were used until about 1920 crookes tubes were unreliable they had to contain a small quantity of gas invariably air as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated however as time passed the x-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas causing the tube to generate harder x-rays until it soon stopped operating larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air known as softeners these often took the form of a small side tube which contained a small piece of mica a mineral that traps relatively large quantities of air within its structure a small electrical heater heated the mica causing it to release a small amount of air thus restoring the tube s efficiency however the mica had a limited life and the restoration process was difficult to control in 1904 john ambrose fleming invented the thermionic diode the first kind of vacuum tube this used a hot cathode that caused an electric current to flow in a vacuum this idea was quickly applied to x-ray tubes and hence heated-cathode x-ray tubes called coolidge tubes completely replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920 in about 1906 the physicist charles barkla discovered that x-rays could be scattered by gases and that each element had a characteristic x-ray spectrum he won the 1917 nobel prize in physics for this discovery in 1912 max von laue paul knipping and walter friedrich first observed the diffraction of x-rays by crystals this discovery along with the early work of paul peter ewald william henry bragg and william lawrence bragg gave birth to the field of x-ray crystallography the coolidge x-ray tube was invented during the following year by william d coolidge it made possible the continuous emissions of x-rays x-ray tubes similar to this are still in use in 2012 chandra s image of the galaxy cluster abell 2125 reveals a complex of several massive multimillion-degree-celsius gas clouds in the process of merging the use of x-rays for medical purposes which developed into the field of radiation therapy was pioneered by major john hall-edwards in birmingham england then in 1908 he had to have his left arm amputated because of the spread of x-ray dermatitis on his arm 41 in 1914 marie curie developed radiological cars to support soldiers injured in world war i the cars would allow for rapid x-ray imaging of wounded soldiers so battlefield surgeons could quickly and more accurately operate 42 from the 1920s through to the 1950s x-ray machines were developed to assist in the fitting of shoes and were sold to commercial shoe stores 43 44 45 concerns regarding the impact of frequent or poorly controlled use were expressed in the 1950s 46 47 leading to the practise s eventual end that decade 48 the x-ray microscope was developed during the 1950s the chandra x-ray observatory launched on july 23 1999 has been allowing the exploration of the very violent processes in the universe which produce x-rays unlike visible light which gives a relatively stable view of the universe the x-ray universe is unstable it features stars being torn apart by black holes galactic collisions and novae and neutron stars that build up layers of plasma that then explode into space an x-ray laser device was proposed as part of the reagan administration s strategic defense initiative in the 1980s but the only test of the device a sort of laser blaster or death ray powered by a thermonuclear explosion gave inconclusive results for technical and political reasons the overall project including the x-ray laser was de-funded though was later revived by the second bush administration as national missile defense using different technologies dog hip xray posterior view phase-contrast x-ray image of spider phase-contrast x-ray imaging refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues it has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures in a wide range of biological and medical studies there are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations 49 50 these include propagation-based phase contrast 51 talbot interferometry 50 refraction-enhanced imaging 52 and x-ray interferometry 53 these methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging making it possible to see smaller details a disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources x-ray optics and high resolution x-ray detectors energy ranges edit soft and hard x-rays edit x-rays with high photon energies above 5 10 kev below 0.2 0.1 nm wavelength are called hard x-rays while those with lower energy are called soft x-rays 54 due to their penetrating ability hard x-rays are widely used to image the inside of objects e g in medical radiography and airport security the term x-ray is metonymically used to refer to a radiographic image produced using this method in addition to the method itself since the wavelengths of hard x-rays are similar to the size of atoms they are also useful for determining crystal structures by x-ray crystallography by contrast soft x-rays are easily absorbed in air the attenuation length of 600 ev 2 nm x-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer 55 gamma rays edit there is no consensus for a definition distinguishing between x-rays and gamma rays one common practice is to distinguish between the two types of radiation based on their source x-rays are emitted by electrons while gamma rays are emitted by the atomic nucleus 56 57 58 59 this definition has several problems other processes also can generate these high-energy photons or sometimes the method of generation is not known one common alternative is to distinguish x- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength or equivalently frequency or photon energy with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength such as 10 11 m 0.1 defined as gamma radiation 60 this criterion assigns a photon to an unambiguous category but is only possible if wavelength is known some measurement techniques do not distinguish between detected wavelengths however these two definitions often coincide since the electromagnetic radiation emitted by x-ray tubes generally has a longer wavelength and lower photon energy than the radiation emitted by radioactive nuclei 56 occasionally one term or the other is used in specific contexts due to historical precedent based on measurement detection technique or based on their intended use rather than their wavelength or source thus gamma-rays generated for medical and industrial uses for example radiotherapy in the ranges of 6 20 mev can in this context also be referred to as x-rays citation needed properties edit ionizing radiation hazard symbol x-ray photons carry enough energy to ionize atoms and disrupt molecular bonds this makes it a type of ionizing radiation and therefore harmful to living tissue a very high radiation dose over a short period of time causes radiation sickness while lower doses can give an increased risk of radiation-induced cancer in medical imaging this increased cancer risk is generally greatly outweighed by the benefits of the examination the ionizing capability of x-rays can be utilized in cancer treatment to kill malignant cells using radiation therapy it is also used for material characterization using x-ray spectroscopy attenuation length of x-rays in water showing the oxygen absorption edge at 540 ev the energy 3 dependence of photoabsorption as well as a leveling off at higher photon energies due to compton scattering the attenuation length is about four orders of magnitude longer for hard x-rays right half compared to soft x-rays left half hard x-rays can traverse relatively thick objects without being much absorbed or scattered for this reason x-rays are widely used to image the inside of visually opaque objects the most often seen applications are in medical radiography and airport security scanners but similar techniques are also important in industry e g industrial radiography and industrial ct scanning and research e g small animal ct the penetration depth varies with several orders of magnitude over the x-ray spectrum this allows the photon energy to be adjusted for the application so as to give sufficient transmission through the object and at the same time provide good contrast in the image x-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light which makes it possible to probe structures much smaller than can be seen using a normal microscope this property is used in x-ray microscopy to acquire high resolution images and also in x-ray crystallography to determine the positions of atoms in crystals interaction with matter edit x-rays interact with matter in three main ways through photoabsorption compton scattering and rayleigh scattering the strength of these interactions depends on the energy of the x-rays and the elemental composition of the material but not much on chemical properties since the x-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies photoabsorption or photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism in the soft x-ray regime and for the lower hard x-ray energies at higher energies compton scattering dominates photoelectric absorption edit the probability of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to z3 e3 where z is the atomic number and e is the energy of the incident photon 61 this rule is not valid close to inner shell electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability so called absorption edges however the general trend of high absorption coefficients and thus short penetration depths for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong for soft tissue photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 kev photon energy where compton scattering takes over for higher atomic number substances this limit is higher the high amount of calcium z 20 in bones together with their high density is what makes them show up so clearly on medical radiographs a photoabsorbed photon transfers all its energy to the electron with which it interacts thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron that is likely to ionize more atoms in its path an outer electron will fill the vacant electron position and produce either a characteristic photon clarification needed or an auger electron these effects can be used for elemental detection through x-ray spectroscopy or auger electron spectroscopy compton scattering edit compton scattering is the predominant interaction between x-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging 62 compton scattering is an inelastic scattering of the x-ray photon by an outer shell electron part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the x-ray the scattered photon can go in any direction but a direction similar to the original direction is more likely especially for high-energy x-rays the probability for different scattering angles are described by the klein nishina formula the transferred energy can be directly obtained from the scattering angle from the conservation of energy and momentum rayleigh scattering edit rayleigh scattering is the dominant elastic scattering mechanism in the x-ray regime 63 inelastic forward scattering gives rise to the refractive index which for x-rays is only slightly below 1 64 production edit whenever charged particles electrons or ions of sufficient energy hit a material x-rays are produced production by electrons edit characteristic x-ray emission lines for some common anode materials 65 66 anode material atomic number photon

27.3 0.0512 0.455 spectrum of the x-rays emitted by an x-ray tube with a rhodium target operated at 60 kv the smooth continuous curve is due to bremsstrahlung and the spikes are characteristic k lines for rhodium atoms x-rays can be generated by an x-ray tube a vacuum tube that uses a high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a hot cathode to a high velocity the high velocity electrons collide with a metal target the anode creating the x-rays 67 in medical x-ray tubes the target is usually tungsten or a more crack-resistant alloy of rhenium 5 and tungsten 95 but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications such as when softer x-rays are needed as in mammography in crystallography a copper target is most common with cobalt often being used when fluorescence from iron content in the sample might otherwise present a problem the maximum energy of the produced x-ray photon is limited by the energy of the incident electron which is equal to the voltage on the tube times the electron charge so an 80 kv tube cannot create x-rays with an energy greater than 80 kev when the electrons hit the target x-rays are created by two different atomic processes characteristic x-ray emission x-ray fluorescence if the electron has enough energy it can knock an orbital electron out of the inner electron shell of a metal atom and as a result electrons from higher energy levels then fill up the vacancy and x-ray photons are emitted this process produces an emission spectrum of x-rays at a few discrete frequencies sometimes referred to as the spectral lines the spectral lines generated depend on the target anode element used and thus are called characteristic lines usually these are transitions from upper shells into k shell called k lines into l shell called l lines and so on bremsstrahlung this is radiation given off by the electrons as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the high-z proton number nuclei these x-rays have a continuous spectrum the intensity of the x-rays increases linearly with decreasing frequency from zero at the energy of the incident electrons the voltage on the x-ray tube so the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage plus several spikes at the characteristic lines the voltages used in diagnostic x-ray tubes range from roughly 20 kv to 150 kv and thus the highest energies of the x-ray photons range from roughly 20 kev to 150 kev 68 both of these x-ray production processes are inefficient with a production efficiency of only about one percent and thus most of the electric power consumed by the tube is released as waste heat when producing a usable flux of x-rays the x-ray tube must be designed to dissipate the excess heat short nanosecond bursts of x-rays peaking at 15-kev in energy may be reliably produced by peeling pressure-sensitive adhesive tape from its backing in a moderate vacuum this is likely to be the result of recombination of electrical charges produced by triboelectric charging the intensity of x-ray triboluminescence is sufficient for it to be used as a source for x-ray imaging 69 a specialized source of x-rays which is becoming widely used in research is synchrotron radiation which is generated by particle accelerators its unique features are x-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of x-ray tubes wide x-ray spectra excellent collimation and linear polarization 70 production by fast positive ions edit x-rays can also be produced by fast protons or other positive ions the proton-induced x-ray emission or particle-induced x-ray emission is widely used as an analytical procedure for high energies the production cross section is proportional to z12z2 4 where z1 refers to the atomic number of the ion z2 to that of the target atom 71 an overview of these cross sections is given in the same reference detectors edit x-ray detectors vary in shape and function depending on their purpose imaging detectors such as those used for radiography were originally based on photographic plates and later photographic film but are now mostly replaced by various digital detector types such as image plates and flat panel detectors for radiation protection direct exposure hazard is often evaluated using ionization chambers while dosimeters are used to measure the radiation dose a person has been exposed to x-ray spectra can be measured either by energy dispersive or wavelength dispersive spectrometers medical uses edit this section needs additional citations for verification

paper on the subject 29 up to 2010 5 billion medical imaging examinations had been conducted worldwide 72 radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 made up about 50 of total ionizing radiation exposure in the united states 73 projectional radiographs edit an arm radiograph demonstrating broken ulna and radius with implanted internal fixation projectional radiography is the practice of producing two-dimensional images using x-ray radiation bones contain much calcium which due to its relatively high atomic number absorbs x-rays efficiently this reduces the amount of x-rays reaching the detector in the shadow of the bones making them clearly visible on the radiograph the lungs and trapped gas also show up clearly because of lower absorption compared to tissue while differences between tissue types are harder to see projectional radiographs are useful in the detection of pathology of the skeletal system as well as for detecting some disease processes in soft tissue some notable examples are the very common chest x-ray which can be used to identify lung diseases such as pneumonia lung cancer or pulmonary edema and the abdominal x-ray which can detect bowel or intestinal obstruction free air from visceral perforations and free fluid in ascites x-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as gallstones which are rarely radiopaque or kidney stones which are often but not always visible traditional plain x-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the brain or muscle one area where projectional radiographs are used extensively is in evaluating how an orthopedic implant such as a knee hip or shoulder replacement is situated in the body with respect to the surrounding bone this can be assessed in two dimensions from plain radiographs or it can be assessed in three dimensions if a technique called 2d to 3d registration is used this technique purportedly negates projection errors associated with evaluating implant position from plain radiographs 74 75 dental radiography is commonly used in the diagnoses of common oral problems such as cavities in medical diagnostic applications the low energy soft x-rays are unwanted since they are totally absorbed by the body increasing the radiation dose without contributing to the image hence a thin metal sheet often of aluminium called an x-ray filter is usually placed over the window of the x-ray tube absorbing the low energy part in the spectrum this is called hardening the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy or harder x-rays to generate an image of the cardiovascular system including the arteries and veins angiography an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest a second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated contrast agent has been injected into the blood vessels within this area these two images are then digitally subtracted leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels the radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine whether there is any damage or blockage of the vessel computed tomography edit head ct scan transverse plane slice - a modern application of medical radiography computed tomography ct scanning is a medical imaging modality where tomographic images or slices of specific areas of the body are obtained from a large series of two-dimensional x-ray images taken in different directions 76 these cross-sectional images can be combined into a three-dimensional image of the inside of the body and used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines fluoroscopy edit fluoroscopy is an imaging technique commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a fluoroscope in its simplest form a fluoroscope consists of an x-ray source and a fluorescent screen between which a patient is placed however modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an x-ray image intensifier and ccd video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor this method may use a contrast material examples include cardiac catheterization to examine for coronary artery blockages and barium swallow to examine for esophageal disorders radiotherapy edit the use of x-rays as a treatment is known as radiation therapy and is largely used for the management including palliation of cancer it requires higher radiation doses than those received for imaging alone x-rays beams are used for treating skin cancers using lower energy x-ray beams while higher energy beams are used for treating cancers within the body such as brain lung prostate and breast 77

the risk of developmental problems and cancer in those exposed 79 80 81 x-rays are classified as a carcinogen by both the world health organization s international agency for research on cancer and the u s government 72 82 it is estimated that 0.4 of current cancers in the united states are due to computed tomography ct scans performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5-2 with 2007 rates of ct usage 83 experimental and epidemiological data currently do not support the proposition that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer 84 however this is under increasing doubt 85 it is estimated that the additional radiation will increase a person s cumulative risk of getting cancer by age 75 by 0.6 1.8 86 the amount of absorbed radiation depends upon the type of x-ray test and the body part involved 87 ct and fluoroscopy entail higher doses of radiation than do plain x-rays to place the increased risk in perspective a plain chest x-ray will expose a person to the same amount from background radiation that people are exposed to depending upon location every day over 10 days while exposure from a dental x-ray is approximately equivalent to 1 day of environmental background radiation 88 each such x-ray would add less than 1 per 1,000,000 to the lifetime cancer risk an abdominal or chest ct would be the equivalent to 2 3 years of background radiation to the whole body or 4 5 years to the abdomen or chest increasing the lifetime cancer risk between 1 per 1,000 to 1 per 10,000 88 this is compared to the roughly 40 chance of a us citizen developing cancer during their lifetime 89 for instance the effective dose to the torso from a ct scan of the chest is about 5 msv and the absorbed dose is about 14 mgy 90 a head ct scan 1.5msv 64mgy 91 that is performed once with and once without contrast agent would be equivalent to 40 years of background radiation to the head accurate estimation of effective doses due to ct is difficult with the estimation uncertainty range of about 19 to 32 for adult head scans depending upon the method used 92 the risk of radiation is greater to a fetus so in pregnant patients the benefits of the investigation x-ray should be balanced with the potential hazards to the fetus 93 94 in the us there are an estimated 62 million ct scans performed annually including more than 4 million on children 87 avoiding unnecessary x-rays especially ct scans reduces radiation dose and any associated cancer risk 95 medical x-rays are a significant source of man-made radiation exposure in 1987 they accounted for 58 of exposure from man-made sources in the united states since man-made sources accounted for only 18 of the total radiation exposure most of which came from natural sources 82 medical x-rays only accounted for 10 of total american radiation exposure medical procedures as a whole including nuclear medicine accounted for 14 of total radiation exposure by 2006 however medical procedures in the united states were contributing much more ionizing radiation than was the case in the early 1980s in 2006 medical exposure constituted nearly half of the total radiation exposure of the u s population from all sources the increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures in particular computed tomography ct and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine 73 96 dosage due to dental x-rays varies significantly depending on the procedure and the technology film or digital depending on the procedure and the technology a single dental x-ray of a human results in an exposure of 0.5 to 4 mrem a full mouth series of x-rays may result in an exposure of up to 6 digital to 18 film mrem for a yearly average of up to 40 mrem 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 financial incentives have been shown to have a significant impact on x-ray use with doctors who are paid a separate fee for each x-ray providing more x-rays 104 other uses edit other notable uses of x-rays include each dot called a reflection in this diffraction pattern forms from the constructive interference of scattered x-rays passing through a crystal the data can be used to determine the crystalline structure x-ray crystallography in which the pattern produced by the diffraction of x-rays through the closely spaced lattice of atoms in a crystal is recorded and then analysed to reveal the nature of that lattice a related technique fiber diffraction was used by rosalind franklin to discover the double helical structure of dna 105 x-ray astronomy which is an observational branch of astronomy which deals with the study of x-ray emission from celestial objects x-ray microscopic analysis which uses electromagnetic radiation in the soft x-ray band to produce images of very small objects x-ray fluorescence a technique in which x-rays are generated within a specimen and detected the outgoing energy of the x-ray can be used to identify the composition of the sample industrial radiography uses x-rays for inspection of industrial parts particularly welds using x-ray for inspection and quality control the differences in the structures of the die and bond wires reveal the left chip to be counterfeit 106 authentication and quality control x-ray is used for authentication and quality control of packaged items industrial ct computed tomography is a process which uses x-ray equipment to produce three-dimensional representations of components both externally and internally this is accomplished through computer processing of projection images of the scanned object in many directions paintings are often x-rayed to reveal underdrawings and pentimenti alterations in the course of painting or by later restorers many pigments such as lead white show well in radiographs x-ray spectromicroscopy has been used to analyse the reactions of pigments in paintings for example in analysing colour degradation in the paintings of van gogh 107 airport security luggage scanners use x-rays for inspecting the interior of luggage for security threats before loading on aircraft border control truck scanners use x-rays for inspecting the interior of trucks x-ray fine art photography of needlefish by peter dazeley x-ray art and fine art photography artistic use of x-rays for example the works by stane jagodi x-ray hair removal a method popular in the 1920s but now banned by the fda 108 shoe-fitting fluoroscopes were popularized in the 1920s banned in the us in the 1960s banned in the uk in the 1970s and even later in continental europe roentgen stereophotogrammetry is used to track movement of bones based on the implantation of markers x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is a chemical analysis technique relying on the photoelectric effect usually employed in surface science radiation implosion is the use of high energy x-rays generated from a fission explosion an a-bomb to compress nuclear fuel to the point of fusion ignition an h-bomb visibility edit while generally considered invisible to the human eye in special circumstances x-rays can be visible brandes in an experiment a short time after r ntgen s landmark 1895 paper reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an x-ray tube seeing a faint blue-gray glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself 109 upon hearing this r ntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect when placing an x-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door r ntgen had noted the same blue glow seeming to emanate from the eye itself but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the experiment was thereafter readily repeatable the knowledge that x-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with ionizing radiation it is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility it could be due to conventional detection excitation of rhodopsin molecules in the retina direct excitation of retinal nerve cells or secondary detection via for instance x-ray induction of phosphorescence in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light though x-rays are otherwise invisible it is possible to see the ionization of the air molecules if the intensity of the x-ray beam is high enough the beamline from the wiggler at the at the european synchrotron radiation facility is one example of such high intensity 110 units of measure and exposure edit the measure of x-rays ionizing ability is called the exposure the coulomb per kilogram c kg is the si unit of ionizing radiation exposure and it is the amount of radiation required to create one coulomb of charge of each polarity in one kilogram of matter the roentgen r is an obsolete traditional unit of exposure which represented the amount of radiation required to create one electrostatic unit of charge of each polarity in one cubic centimeter of dry air 1 roentgen 2.58 10 4 c kg however the effect of ionizing radiation on matter especially living tissue is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited into them rather than the charge generated this measure of energy absorbed is called the absorbed dose the gray gy which has units of joules kilogram is the si unit of absorbed dose and it is the amount of radiation required to deposit one joule of energy in one kilogram of any kind of matter the rad is the obsolete corresponding traditional unit equal to 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram 100 rad 1 gray the equivalent dose is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue for x-rays it is equal to the absorbed dose the roentgen equivalent man rem is the traditional unit of equivalent dose for x-rays it is equal to the rad or in other words 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram 100 rem 1 sv the sievert sv is the si unit of equivalent dose and also of effective dose for x-rays the equivalent dose is numerically equal to a gray gy 1 sv 1 gy for the
