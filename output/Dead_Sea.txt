palestine to the west its surface and shores are 430.5 metres 1,412 ft below sea level 4 6 earth s lowest elevation on land the dead sea is 304 m 997 ft deep the deepest hypersaline lake in the world with a salinity of 342 g kg or 34.2 in 2011 it is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean and one of the world s saltiest bodies of water 7 this salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish hence its name the dead sea is 50 kilometres 31 mi long and 15 kilometres 9 mi wide at its widest point 1 it lies in the jordan rift valley and its main tributary is the jordan river the dead sea has attracted visitors from around the mediterranean basin for thousands of years it was one of the world s first health resorts for herod the great and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products from asphalt for egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers people also use the salt and the minerals from the dead sea to create cosmetics and herbal sachets the dead seawater has a density of 1.24 kg litre which makes swimming similar to floating 8 9 the dead sea is receding at an alarming rate multiple canals and pipelines were proposed to reduce its recession which had begun causing many problems the red sea dead sea water conveyance project carried out by jordan will provide water to neighbouring countries while the brine will be carried to the dead sea to help stabilise its levels the first phase of the project is scheduled to begin in 2018 and be completed in 2021 10 contents 1 etymology and toponymy 2 geography 3 natural history 4 climate 5

satellite photograph showing the location of the dead sea east of the mediterranean sea the dead sea is an endorheic lake located in the jordan rift valley a geographic feature formed by the dead sea transform dst this left lateral-moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the african plate and the arabian plate it runs between the east anatolian fault zone in turkey and the northern end of the red sea rift offshore of the southern tip of sinai it is here that the upper jordan river sea of galilee lower jordan river water system comes to an end the jordan river is the only major water source flowing into the dead sea although there are small perennial springs under and around the dead sea forming pools and quicksand pits along the edges 13 there are no outlet streams the mujib river biblical arnon is one the larger water sources of the dead sea other than the jordan 14 the wadi mujib valley 420 m below the sea level in the southern of jordan valley is a biosphere reserve with an area of 212 km2 82 sq mi 15 other more substantial sources are wadi darajeh arabic nahal dragot hebrew and nahal arugot 14 wadi hasa biblical zered is another wadi flowing into the dead sea rainfall is scarcely 100 mm 4 in per year in the northern part of the dead sea and barely 50 mm 2 in in the southern part 16 the dead sea zone s aridity is due to the rainshadow effect of the judaean mountains the highlands east of the dead sea receive more rainfall than the dead sea itself to the west of the dead sea the judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east along the southwestern side of the lake is a 210 m 700 ft tall halite formation called mount sodom natural history there are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the dead sea the older hypothesis is that the dead sea lies in a true rift zone an extension of the red sea rift or even of the great rift valley of eastern africa a more recent hypothesis is that the dead sea basin is a consequence of a step-over discontinuity along the dead sea transform creating an extension of the crust with consequent subsidence around 3.7 million years ago citation needed what is now the valley of the jordan river dead sea and the northern wadi arabah was repeatedly inundated by waters from the mediterranean sea the waters formed in a narrow crooked bay that is called by geologists the sedom lagoon which was connected to the sea through what is now the jezreel valley the floods of the valley came and went depending on long-scale climate change the sedom lagoon 17 deposited beds of salt that eventually became 2.5 km 1.55 mi thick approximately two million years ago citation needed the land between the rift valley and the mediterranean sea rose to such an extent that the ocean could no longer flood the area thus the long lagoon became a landlocked lake the sedom lagoon extended at its maximum from the sea of galilee in the north to somewhere around 50 km 30 mi south of the current southern end of the dead sea and the subsequent lakes obviously never surpassed this expanse the hula depression was never part of any of these water bodies due to its higher elevation and the high threshold of the korazim block separating it from the sea of galilee basin 18 the first prehistoric lake to follow the sedom lagoon is named lake amora followed by lake lisan and finally by the dead sea 17 the water levels and salinity of these lakes have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the valley bottom and due to climate variation as the climate became more arid lake lisan finally shrank and became saltier leaving the dead sea as its last remainder 17 18 pebbles cemented with halite on the western shore of the dead sea near ein gedi in prehistoric times great amounts of sediment collected on the floor of lake amora the sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the lisan peninsula and mount sodom on the southwest side of the lake geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket when the floor of the dead sea dropped further due to tectonic forces the salt mounts of lisan and mount sodom stayed in place as high cliffs see salt dome from 70,000 to 12,000 years ago the lake s level was 100 m 330 ft to 250 m 820 ft higher than its current level this lake lake lisan fluctuated dramatically rising to its highest level around 26,000 years ago indicating a very wet climate in the near east 19 around 10,000 years ago the lake s level dropped dramatically probably to even lower than today s during the last several thousand years the lake has fluctuated approximately 400 m 1,300 ft with some significant drops and rises current theories as to the cause of this dramatic drop in levels rule out volcanic activity therefore it may have been a seismic event climate the dead sea s climate offers year-round sunny skies and dry air it has less than 50 millimetres 2 in mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between 32 and 39 c 90 and 102 f winter average temperatures range between 20 and 23 c 68 and 73 f the region has weaker ultraviolet radiation particularly the uvb erythrogenic rays given the higher atmospheric pressure the air has a slightly higher oxygen content 3.3 in summer to 4.8 in winter as compared to oxygen concentration at sea level 20 21 barometric pressures at the dead sea were measured between 1061 and 1065 hpa and clinically compared with health effects at higher altitude 22 this barometric measure is about 5 higher than sea level standard atmospheric pressure of 1013.25 hpa which is the global ocean mean or atm the dead sea affects temperatures nearby because of the moderating effect a large body of water has on climate during the winter sea temperatures tend to be higher than land temperatures and vice versa during the summer months this is the result of the water s mass and specific heat capacity on average there are 192 days above 30c 86f annually 23 climate data for dead sea sedom 390 m

djibouti 34.8 lagoon garabogazk l in the caspian sea up to 35 and some hypersaline ponds and lakes of the mcmurdo dry valleys in antarctica such as don juan pond 44 have reported higher salinities until the winter of 1978 79 when a major mixing event took place 25 the dead sea was composed of two stratified layers of water that differed in temperature density age and salinity the topmost 35 meters 115 ft or so of the dead sea had an average salinity of 342 parts per thousand in 2002 and a temperature that swung between 19 c 66 f and 37 c 99 f underneath a zone of transition the lowest level of the dead sea had waters of a consistent 22 c 72 f temperature and complete saturation of sodium chloride nacl citation needed since the water near the bottom is saturated the salt precipitates out of solution onto the sea floor beginning in the 1960s water inflow to the dead sea from the jordan river was reduced as a result of large-scale irrigation and generally low rainfall by 1975 the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer nevertheless the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense when the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer the waters mixed 1978 79 for the first time in centuries the lake was a homogeneous body of water since then stratification has begun to redevelop 25 the mineral content of the dead sea is very different from that of ocean water the exact composition of the dead sea water varies mainly with season depth and temperature in the early 1980s the concentration of ionic species in g kg of dead sea surface water was cl 181.4 br 4.2 so42 0.4 hco3 0.2 ca2 14.1 na 32.5 k 6.2 and mg2 35.2 the total salinity was 276 g kg 26 these results show that the composition of the salt as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis was calcium chloride cacl2 14.4 potassium chloride kcl 4.4 magnesium chloride mgcl2 50.8 and sodium chloride nacl 30.4 in comparison the salt in the water of most oceans and seas is approximately 85 sodium chloride the concentration of sulfate ions so42 is very low and the concentration of bromide ions br is the highest of all waters on earth the salt concentration of the dead sea fluctuates around 31.5 this is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24 kg l anyone can easily float in the dead sea because of natural buoyancy in this respect the dead sea is similar to the great salt lake in utah in the united states an unusual feature of the dead sea is its discharge of asphalt from deep seeps the dead sea constantly spits up small pebbles and blocks of the black substance 27 asphalt-coated figurines and bitumen-coated neolithic skulls from archaeological sites have been found egyptian mummification processes used asphalt imported from the dead sea region 28 29 putative therapies this article needs more medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources please review the contents of the article and if you can unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed march 2015 the dead sea area has become a location for health research and potential treatment for several reasons the mineral content of the water the low content of pollens and other allergens in the atmosphere the reduced ultraviolet component of solar radiation and the higher atmospheric pressure at this great depth each may have specific health effects for example persons experiencing reduced respiratory function from diseases such as cystic fibrosis seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure 30 the region s climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for assessment of putative therapies climatotherapy treatment which exploits local climatic features such as temperature humidity sunshine barometric pressure and special atmospheric constituents heliotherapy treatment that exploits the biological effects of the sun s radiation thalassotherapy treatment that exploits bathing in dead sea water psoriasis climatotherapy at the dead sea may be a therapy for psoriasis 31 by sunbathing for long periods in the area due to its position below sea level and subsequent result that uv rays are partially blocked by the increased cloud cover over the dead sea 32 rhinosinusitis rhinosinusitis patients receiving dead sea saline nasal irrigation exhibited improved symptom relief compared to standard hypertonic saline spray in one study 33 osteoarthritis dead sea mud pack therapy has been suggested to temporarily relieve pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees according to researchers of the ben gurion university of the negev treatment with mineral-rich mud compresses can be used to augment conventional medical therapy 34 panorama of the dead sea from the m venpick resort jordan fauna and flora dead sea in the morning seen from masada the sea is called dead because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms such as fish and aquatic plants from living in it though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present in times of flood the salt content of the dead sea can drop from its usual 35 to 30 or lower the dead sea temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters in 1980 after one such rainy winter the normally dark blue dead sea turned red researchers from hebrew university of jerusalem found the dead sea to be teeming with a type of alga called dunaliella dunaliella in turn nourished carotenoid-containing red-pigmented halobacteria whose presence caused the color change since 1980 the dead sea basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers in 2011 a group of scientists from be er sheva israel and germany discovered fissures in the floor of the dead sea by scuba diving and observing the surface these fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter the dead sea they sampled biofilms surrounding the fissures and discovered numerous species of bacteria and archaea 35 many animal species live in the mountains surrounding the dead sea hikers can see ibex hares hyraxes jackals foxes and even leopards hundreds of bird species inhabit the zone as well both jordan and israel have established nature reserves around the dead sea the delta of the jordan river was formerly a jungle of papyrus and palm trees the jewish historian flavius josephus described jericho as the most fertile spot in judea in roman and byzantine times sugarcane dubious discuss henna and sycamore fig all made the lower jordan valley wealthy one of the most valuable products produced by jericho was the sap of the balsam tree which could be made into perfume by the 19th century jericho s fertility had disappeared dubious discuss human settlement there are several small communities near the dead sea these include ein gedi neve zohar and the israeli settlements in the megilot regional council kalya mitzpe shalem and avnat there is a nature preserve at ein gedi and several dead sea hotels are located on the southwest end at ein bokek near neve zohar highway 90 runs north-south on the israeli side for a total distance of 565 km 351 mi from metula on the lebanese border in the north to its southern terminus at the egyptian border near the red sea port of eilat potash city is a small community on

history mount sodom israel showing the so-called lot s wife pillar made of halite like the rest of the mountain a cargo boat on the dead sea as seen on the madaba map from the 6th century ad biblical period dwelling in caves near the dead sea is recorded in the hebrew bible as having taken place before the israelites came to canaan and extensively at the time of king david just northwest of the dead sea is jericho somewhere perhaps on the southeastern shore would be the cities mentioned in the book of genesis which were said to have been destroyed in the time of abraham sodom and gomorra genesis 18 and the three other cities of the plain admah zeboim and zoar deuteronomy 29 23 zoar escaped destruction when abraham s nephew lot escaped to zoar from sodom genesis 19 21-22 before the destruction the dead sea was a valley full of natural tar pits which was called the vale of siddim king david was said to have hidden from saul at ein gedi nearby in ezekiel there is a specific prophecy that the sea will be healed and made fresh becoming a normal lake capable of supporting marine life a similar prophecy is stated in zechariah which says that living waters will go out from jerusalem half of them to the eastern sea likely the dead sea and half to the western sea the mediterranean greek and roman period aristotle wrote about the remarkable waters the nabateans and others discovered the value of the globs of natural asphalt that constantly floated to the surface where they could be harvested with nets the egyptians were steady customers as they used asphalt in the embalming process that created mummies the ancient romans knew the dead sea as palus asphaltites 36 asphalt lake king herod the great built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces on the western bank of the dead sea the most famous was masada where in 70 ce a small group of jewish zealots fled after the fall of the destruction of the second temple the zealots survived until 73 ce when a siege by the x legion ended in the deaths by suicide of its 960 inhabitants another historically important fortress was machaerus on the eastern bank where according to josephus john the baptist was imprisoned by herod antipas and died 37 also in roman times some essenes settled on the dead sea s western shore pliny the elder identifies their location with the words on the west side of the dead sea away from the coast above the town of engeda natural history bk 5.73 and it is therefore a hugely popular but contested hypothesis today that same essenes are identical with the settlers at qumran and that the dead sea scrolls discovered during the 20th century in the nearby caves had been their own library josephus identified the dead sea in geographic proximity to the ancient biblical city of sodom however he referred to the lake by its greek name asphaltites 38 various sects of jews settled in caves overlooking the dead sea the best known of these are the essenes of qumran who left an extensive library known as the dead sea scrolls 39 the town of ein gedi mentioned many times in the mishna produced persimmon for the temple s fragrance and for export using a secret recipe sodomite salt was an essential mineral for the temple s holy incense but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness 40 the roman camps surrounding masada were built by jewish slaves receiving water from the towns around the lake these towns had drinking water from the ein feshcha springs and other sweetwater springs in the vicinity 41 byzantine period intimately connected with the judean wilderness to its northwest and west the dead sea was a place of escape and refuge the remoteness of the region attracted greek orthodox monks since the byzantine era their monasteries such as saint george in wadi kelt and mar saba in the judaean desert are places of pilgrimage modern times in the 19th century the river jordan and the dead sea were explored by boat primarily by christopher costigan in 1835 thomas howard molyneux in 1847 william francis lynch in 1848 and john macgregor in 1869 42 the full text of w f lynch s 1949 book narrative of the united states expedition to the river jordan and the dead sea is available online charles leonard irby and james mangles travelled along the shores of the dead sea already in 1817-18 but didn t navigate on its waters 43 world s lowest dry point jordan 1971 explorers and scientists arrived in the area to analyze the minerals and research the unique climate after the find of the moabite stone in 1868 on the plateau east of the dead sea moses wilhelm shapira and his partner salim al-khouri forged and sold a whole range of presumed moabite antiquities and in 1883 shapira presented what is now known as the shapira strips a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the dead sea the strips were declared to be forgeries and shapira took his own life in disgrace in the late 1940s and early 1950s hundreds of religious documents dated between 150 bce and 70 ce were found in caves near the ancient settlement of qumran about one mile 1.6 kilometres inland from the northwestern shore of the dead sea presently in the west bank they became known and famous as the dead sea scrolls the world s lowest roads highway 90 run along the israeli and west bank shores of the dead sea along with highway 65 on the jordanian side at 393 m 1,289 ft below sea level tourism and leisure ein bokek a resort on the israeli shore british mandate period a golf course named for sodom and gomorrah was built by the british at kalia on the northern shore israel the first major israeli hotels were built in nearby arad and since the 1960s at the ein bokek resort complex israel has 15 hotels along the dead sea shore generating total revenues of 291 million in 2012 most israeli hotels and resorts on the dead sea are on a six-kilometre 3.7-mile stretch of the southern shore 44 jordan kempinski hotel one of the many hotels on the jordanian shore on the jordanian side nine international franchises have opened seaside resort hotels near the king hussein bin talal convention center along with resort apartments on the eastern shore of the dead sea the 9 hotels have boosted the jordanian side s capacity to 2,800 rooms 45 on november 22 2015 the dead sea panorama road was included along with 40 archaeological locations in jordan to become live on google street view 46 west bank the palestinian dead sea coast is about 40 kilometres 25 miles long the world bank estimates that a palestinian dead sea tourism industry could generate 290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs 44 however palestinians have been unable to obtain construction permits for tourism-related investments on the dead sea 44 according to the world bank officials in the palestinian ministry of tourism and antiquities state that the only way to apply for such permits is through the joint committees established under the oslo agreement but the relevant committee has not met with any degree of regularity since 2000 44 chemical industry the southern basin of the dead sea as of 1817-18 with the lisan peninsula and its ford now named lynch strait north is to the right view of salt evaporation pans on the dead sea taken in 1989 from the space shuttle columbia sts-28 the southern half is separated from the northern half at what used to be the lisan peninsula because of the fall in level of the dead sea view of the mineral evaporation ponds almost 12 years later sts-102 a northern and small southeastern extension were added and the large polygonal ponds subdivided the dwindling water level of the dead sea british mandate period in the early part of the 20th century the dead sea began to attract interest from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of potash potassium chloride and bromine the palestine potash company was chartered in 1929 after its founder siberian jewish engineer and pioneer of lake baikal exploitation moses novomeysky worked for the charter for over ten years the first plant was on the north shore of the dead sea at kalya and produced potash by solar evaporation of the brine employing arabs and jews it was an island of peace in turbulent times 47 the company quickly grew into the largest industrial site in the middle east citation needed and in 1934 built a second plant on the southwest shore in the mount sodom area south of the lashon region of the dead sea palestine potash company supplied half of britain s potash during world war ii both plants were destroyed by the jordanians in the 1948 arab israeli war 48 israel the dead sea works was founded in 1952 as a state-owned enterprise based on the remnants of the palestine potash company 49 in 1995 the company was privatized and it is now owned by israel chemicals from the dead sea brine israel produces 2001 1.77 million tons potash 206,000 tons elemental bromine 44,900 tons caustic soda 25,000 tons magnesium metal and sodium chloride israeli companies generate around us 3 billion annually from the sale of dead sea minerals primarily potash and bromine and from other products that are derived from dead sea minerals 44 jordan on the jordanian side of the dead sea arab potash apc formed in 1956 produces 2.0 million tons of potash annually as well as sodium chloride and bromine the plant is located at safi south aghwar department in the karak governorate jordanian dead sea mineral industries generate about 1.2 billion in sales equivalent to 4 percent of jordan s gdp west bank the palestinian dead sea coast is about 40 kilometres 25 miles long the palestinian economy is unable to benefit from dead sea chemicals due to restricted access permit issues and the uncertainties of the investment climate 44 the world bank estimates that a palestinian dead sea chemicals industry could generate 918m incremental value added per year almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of palestinian territories today 44 extraction both companies dead sea works ltd and arab potash use extensive salt evaporation pans that have essentially diked the entire southern end of the dead sea for the purpose of producing carnallite potassium magnesium chloride which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride the ponds are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north-south along the international border the power plant on the israeli side allows production of magnesium metal by a subsidiary dead sea magnesium ltd due to the popularity of the sea s therapeutic and healing properties several companies have also shown interest in the manufacturing and supplying of dead sea salts as raw materials for body and skin care products recession and environmental concerns the planned red sea dead sea water conveyance whose first phase will begin construction in 2018 will work towards stabilizing the falling levels of the dead sea since 1930 when its surface was 1,050 km2 410 sq mi and its level was 390 m 1,280 ft below sea level the dead sea has been monitored continuously 50 in recent decades the dead sea has been rapidly shrinking because of diversion of incoming water from the jordan river to the north the southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the dead sea works a company that converts the sea s raw materials from a water surface of 395 m 1,296 ft below sea level in 1970 51 it fell 22 m 72 ft to 418 m 1,371 ft below sea level in 2006 reaching a drop rate of 1 m 3 ft per year as the water level decreases the characteristics of the sea and surrounding region may substantially change the dead sea level drop has been followed by a groundwater level drop causing brines that used to occupy underground layers near the shoreline to be flushed out by freshwater this is believed to be the cause of the recent appearance of large sinkholes along the western shore incoming freshwater dissolves salt layers rapidly creating subsurface cavities that subsequently collapse to form these sinkholes 52 gully in unconsolidated dead sea sediments exposed by recession of water levels it was excavated by floods from the judean mountains in less than a year in may 2009 at the world economic forum jordan announced its plans to construct the jordan national red sea development project jrsp this is a plan to convey seawater from the red sea near aqaba to the dead sea water would be desalinated along the route to provide fresh water to jordan with the brine discharge sent to the dead sea for replenishment the early planning called for developer and financier selection to be completed by year s end with detailed design to begin in early 2010 and water delivery by 2017 israel expressed its support and will likely benefit from some of the water delivery to its negev region some hydro-power will be collected near the dead sea from the dramatic change in elevation on the downhill side of the project citation needed at a regional conference in july 2009 officials expressed concern about the declining water levels some suggested industrial activities around the dead sea might need to be
