wikidata argon is a chemical element with symbol ar and atomic number 18 it is in group 18 of the periodic table and is a noble gas 6 argon is the third-most abundant gas in the earth s atmosphere at 0.934 9340 ppmv it is more than twice as abundant as water vapor which averages about 4000 ppmv but varies greatly 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide 400 ppmv and more than 500 times as abundant as neon 18 ppmv argon is the most abundant noble gas in earth s crust comprising 0.00015 of the crust nearly all of the argon in the earth s atmosphere is radiogenic argon-40 derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the earth s crust in the universe argon-36 is by far the most common argon isotope as it is the most easily produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas the name argon is derived from the greek word neuter singular form of meaning lazy or inactive as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions the complete octet eight electrons in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements its triple point temperature of 83.8058 k is a defining fixed point in the international temperature scale of 1990 argon is produced industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air argon is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive for example an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning argon is also used in incandescent fluorescent lighting and other gas-discharge tubes argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters contents 1 characteristics 2 history 3 occurrence 4 isotopes 5 compounds 6 production

and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen argon is colorless odorless nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid liquid or gas 7 argon is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature although argon is a noble gas it can form some compounds under extreme conditions argon fluorohydride harf a compound of argon with fluorine and hydrogen that is stable below 17 k 256.1 c 429.1 f has been demonstrated 8 9 although the neutral ground-state chemical compounds of argon are presently limited to harf argon can form clathrates with water when atoms of argon are trapped in a lattice of water molecules 10 ions such as arh and excited-state complexes such as arf have been demonstrated theoretical calculation predicts several more argon compounds that should be stable 11 but have not yet been synthesized history edit lord rayleigh s method for the isolation of argon based on an experiment of henry cavendish s the gases are contained in a test-tube a standing over a large quantity of weak alkali b and the current is conveyed in wires insulated by u-shaped glass tubes cc passing through the liquid and round the mouth of the test-tube the inner platinum ends dd of the wire receive a current from a battery of five grove cells and a ruhmkorff coil of medium size argon greek neuter singular form of meaning lazy or inactive is named in reference to its chemical inactivity this chemical property of this first noble gas to be discovered impressed the namers 12 13 an unreactive gas was suspected to be a component of air by henry cavendish in 1785 argon was first isolated from air in 1894 by lord rayleigh and sir william ramsay at university college london by removing oxygen carbon dioxide water and nitrogen from a sample of clean air 14 15 16 they had determined that nitrogen produced from chemical compounds was 0.5 lighter than nitrogen from the atmosphere the difference was slight but it was important enough to attract their attention for many months they concluded that there was another gas in the air mixed in with the nitrogen 17 argon was also encountered in 1882 through independent research of h f newall and w n hartley citation needed each observed new lines in the emission spectrum of air that did not match known elements until 1957 the symbol for argon was a but now is ar 18 occurrence edit argon constitutes 0.934 by volume and 1.288 by mass of the earth s atmosphere 19 and air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products argon is isolated from air by fractionation most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation a process that also produces purified nitrogen oxygen neon krypton and xenon 20 the earth s crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon respectively 21 isotopes edit the main isotopes of argon found on earth are 40 ar 99.6 36 ar 0.34 and 38 ar 0.06 naturally occurring 40 k with a half-life of 1.25 109 years decays to stable 40 ar 11.2 by electron capture or positron emission and also to stable 40 ca 88.8 by beta decay these properties and ratios are used to determine the age of rocks by k ar dating 21 22 in the earth s atmosphere 39 ar is made by cosmic ray activity primarily by neutron capture of 40 ar followed by two-neutron emission in the subsurface environment it is also produced through neutron capture by 39 k followed by proton emission 37 ar is created from the neutron capture by 40 ca followed by an alpha particle emission as a result of subsurface nuclear explosions it has a half-life of 35 days 22 between locations in the solar system the isotopic composition of argon varies greatly where the major source of argon is the decay of 40 k in rocks 40 ar will be the dominant isotope as it is on earth argon produced directly by stellar nucleosynthesis is dominated by the alpha-process nuclide 36 ar correspondingly solar argon contains 84.6 36 ar according to solar wind measurements 23 and the ratio of the three isotopes 36ar 38ar 40ar in the atmospheres of the outer planets is 8400 1600 1 24 this contrasts with the low abundance of primordial 36 ar in earth s atmosphere which is only 31.5 ppmv 9340 ppmv 0.337 comparable with that of neon 18.18 ppmv on earth and with interplanetary gasses measured by probes the atmospheres of mars mercury and titan the largest moon of saturn contain argon predominantly as 40 ar and its content may be as high as 1.93 mars 25 the predominance of radiogenic 40 ar is the reason the standard atomic weight of terrestrial argon is greater than that of the next element potassium a fact that was puzzling when argon was discovered mendeleev positioned the elements on his periodic table in order of atomic weight but the inertness of argon suggested a placement before the reactive alkali metal henry moseley later solved this problem by showing that the periodic table is actually arranged in order of atomic number see history of the periodic table compounds edit space-filling model of argon fluorohydride argon s complete octet of electrons indicates full s and p subshells this full valence shell makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements before 1962 argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds however compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized the first argon compound with tungsten pentacarbonyl w co 5ar was isolated in 1975 however it was not widely recognised at that time 26 in august 2000 another argon compound argon fluorohydride harf was formed by researchers at the university of helsinki by shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride with caesium iodide this discovery caused the recognition that argon could form weakly bound compounds even though it was not the first 9 27 28 it is stable up to 17 kelvins 256 c the metastable arcf2 2 dication which is valence-isoelectronic with carbonyl fluoride and phosgene was observed in 2010 29 argon-36 in the form of argon hydride argonium ions has been detected in interstellar medium associated with the crab nebula supernova this was the first noble-gas molecule detected in outer space 30 31 solid argon hydride ar h2 2 has the same crystal structure as the mgzn2 laves phase it forms at pressures between 4.3 and 220 gpa though raman measurements suggest that the h2 molecules in ar h2 2 dissociate above 175 gpa 32 production edit industrial edit argon is produced industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air in a cryogenic air separation unit a process that separates liquid nitrogen which boils at 77.3 k from argon which boils at 87.3 k and liquid oxygen which boils at 90.2 k about 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year 21 33 in radioactive decays edit 40ar the most abundant isotope of argon is produced by the decay of 40k with a half-life of 1.25 109 years by electron capture or positron emission because of this it is used in potassium argon dating to determine the age of rocks applications edit cylinders containing argon gas for use in extinguishing fire without damaging server equipment argon has several desirable properties argon is a chemically inert gas argon is the cheapest alternative when nitrogen is not sufficiently inert argon has low thermal conductivity argon has electronic properties ionization and or the emission spectrum desirable for some applications other noble gases would be equally suitable for most of these applications but argon is by far the cheapest argon is inexpensive since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale the other noble gases except helium are produced this way as well but argon is the most plentiful by far the bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap industrial processes edit argon is used in some high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive for example an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning for some of these processes the presence of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material argon is used in some types of arc welding such as gas metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding as well as in the processing of titanium and other reactive elements an argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of silicon and germanium argon is used in the poultry industry to asphyxiate birds either for mass culling following disease outbreaks or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during gassing 34 35 its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird argon also enhances shelf life 36 argon is sometimes used for extinguishing fires where valuable equipment may be damaged by water or foam 37 scientific research edit liquid argon is used as the target for neutrino experiments and direct dark matter searches the interaction between the hypothetical wimps and an argon nucleus produces scintillation light that is detected by photomultiplier tubes two-phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the wimp nucleus scattering as with most other liquefied noble gases argon has a high scintillation light yield about 51 photons kev 38 is transparent to its own scintillation light and is relatively easy to purify compared to xenon argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils on the other hand its intrinsic beta-ray background is larger due to 39 ar contamination unless one uses argon from underground sources which has much less 39 ar contamination most of the argon in the earth s atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long-lived 40 k 40 k e 40 ar present in natural potassium within the earth the 39 ar activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through the knockout reaction 40 ar n,2n 39 ar and similar reactions the half-life of 39 ar is only 269 years as a result the underground ar shielded by rock and water has much less 39 ar contamination 39 dark-matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include darkside warp ardm microclean and deap neutrino experiments include icarus and microboone both of which use high-purity liquid argon in a time projection chamber for fine grained three-dimensional imaging of neutrino interactions preservative edit a sample of caesium is packed under argon to avoid reactions with air argon is used to displace oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents argon has the european food additive code e938 aerial oxidation hydrolysis and other chemical reactions that degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely high-purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes packed and sealed in argon in winemaking argon is used in a variety of activities to provide a barrier against oxygen at the liquid surface which can spoil wine by fueling both microbial metabolism as with acetic acid bacteria and standard redox chemistry argon is sometimes used as the propellant in aerosol cans for such products as varnish polyurethane and paint and to displace air when preparing a container for storage after opening 40 since 2002 the american national archives stores important national documents such as the declaration of independence and the constitution within argon-filled cases to inhibit their degradation argon is preferable to the helium that had been used in the preceding five decades because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced 41 laboratory equipment edit gloveboxes are often filled with argon which recirculates over scrubbers to maintain an oxygen- nitrogen- and moisture-free atmosphere argon may be used as the inert gas within schlenk lines and gloveboxes argon is preferred to less expensive nitrogen in cases where nitrogen may react with the reagents or apparatus argon may be used as the carrier gas in gas chromatography and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in icp spectroscopy argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy argon gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication medical use edit cryosurgery procedures such as cryoablation use liquid argon to destroy tissue such as cancer cells it is used in a procedure called argon-enhanced coagulation a form of argon plasma beam electrosurgery the procedure carries a risk of producing gas embolism and has resulted in the death of at least one patient 42 blue argon lasers are used in surgery to weld arteries destroy tumors and correct eye defects 21 argon has also been used experimentally to replace nitrogen in the breathing or decompression mix known as argox to speed the elimination of dissolved nitrogen from the blood 43 lighting edit argon gas-discharge lamp forming the symbol for argon ar incandescent lights are filled with argon to preserve the filaments at high temperature from oxidation it is used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics gas-discharge lamps filled with pure argon provide lilac violet light with argon and some mercury blue light argon is also used for blue and green argon-ion lasers miscellaneous uses edit argon is used for thermal insulation in energy-efficient windows 44 argon is also used in technical scuba diving to inflate a dry suit because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity 45 argon is used as a propellant in the development of the variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket vasimr compressed argon gas is allowed to expand to cool the seeker heads of some versions of the aim-9 sidewinder missile and other missiles that use cooled thermal seeker heads the gas is stored at high pressure 46 argon-39 with a half-life of 269 years has been used for a number of applications primarily ice core and ground water dating also potassium argon dating and related argon-argon dating is used to date sedimentary metamorphic and igneous rocks 21 argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent to simulate hypoxic conditions in 2014 the world anti-doping agency wada added argon and xenon to the list of prohibited substances and methods although at this time there is no reliable test for abuse 47 safety edit although argon is non-toxic it is 38 denser than air and therefore considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas it is difficult to detect because it is colorless odorless and tasteless a 1994 incident in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in alaska highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use storage and handling 48 see also edit industrial gas oxygen argon ratio a ratio of two physically similar gases which has
