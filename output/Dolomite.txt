mineral dolomite an alternative name sometimes used for the dolomitic rock type is dolostone contents 1 history 2 properties 3 formation 4 uses 5 see also 6 references 7 external links history edit most probably the mineral dolomite was first described by carl linnaeus in 1768 6 in 1791 it was described as a rock by the french naturalist and geologist d odat gratet de dolomieu 1750 1801 first in buildings of the old city of rome and later as samples collected in the mountains now known as the dolomite alps of northern italy nicolas-th odore de saussure first named the mineral after dolomieu in march 1792 7 properties edit the mineral dolomite crystallizes in the trigonal-rhombohedral system it forms white tan gray or pink crystals dolomite is a double carbonate having an alternating structural arrangement of calcium and magnesium ions it does not rapidly dissolve or effervesce fizz in dilute hydrochloric acid as calcite does crystal twinning is common solid solution exists between dolomite the iron-dominant ankerite and the manganese-dominant kutnohorite 8 small amounts of iron in the structure give the crystals a yellow to brown tint manganese substitutes in the structure also up to about three percent mno a high manganese content gives the crystals a rosy pink color lead zinc and cobalt also substitute in the structure for magnesium the mineral dolomite is closely related to huntite mg3ca co3 4 because dolomite can be dissolved by slightly acidic water areas of dolomite are important as aquifers and contribute to karst terrain formation 9 formation edit modern dolomite formation has been found to occur under anaerobic conditions in supersaturated saline lagoons along the rio de janeiro coast of brazil namely lagoa vermelha and brejo do espinho it is often thought that dolomite will develop only with the help of sulfate-reducing bacteria e g desulfovibrio brasiliensis 10 however low-temperature dolomite may occur in natural environments rich in organic matter and microbial cell surfaces this occurs as a result of magnesium complexation by carboxyl groups associated with organic matter 11 dolomite white with magnesite yellowish from spain upper triassic dolostone of the cho nappe in slovakia vast deposits of dolomite are present in the geological record but the mineral is relatively rare in modern environments reproducible inorganic low-temperature syntheses of dolomite and magnesite were published for the first time in 1999 those laboratory experiments showed how the initial precipitation of a metastable precursor such as magnesium calcite will change gradually into more and more of the stable phase such as dolomite or magnesite during periodical intervals of dissolution and re-precipitation the general principle governing the course of this irreversible geochemical reaction has been coined breaking ostwald s step rule 12 there is some evidence for a biogenic occurrence of dolomite one example is that of the formation of dolomite in the urinary bladder of a dalmatian dog possibly as the result of an illness or infection 13 uses edit dolomite is used as an ornamental stone a concrete aggregate and a source of magnesium oxide as well as in the pidgeon process for the production of magnesium it is an important petroleum reservoir rock and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound mississippi valley-type mvt ore deposits of base metals such as lead zinc and copper where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly dolomite is sometimes used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass in horticulture dolomite and dolomitic limestone are added to soils and soilless potting mixes as a ph buffer and as a magnesium source dolomite is also used as the substrate in marine saltwater aquariums to help buffer changes in ph of the water calcined dolomite is also used as a catalyst for destruction of tar in the gasification of biomass at high temperature 14 dolomite light pink with chalcopyrite from the tri-state district cherokee county kansas size 11.4 7.2 4.6 cm particle physics researchers like to build particle detectors under layers of dolomite to enable the detectors to detect the highest possible number of exotic particles because dolomite contains relatively minor quantities of radioactive materials it can insulate against interference from cosmic rays without adding to background radiation levels 15 see also edit dolomitization evaporite list of minerals magnesian limestone
