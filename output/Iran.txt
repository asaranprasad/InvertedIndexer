in the seventh century bc 19 and reached its greatest extent during the achaemenid empire founded by cyrus the great in the sixth century bc stretching from eastern europe to the indus valley becoming a larger empire than previously ever existed in the world 20 the iranian realm fell to alexander the great in the fourth century bc but reemerged shortly after as the parthian empire followed by the sasanian empire which became a leading world power for the next four centuries 21 22 arab muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century ad ultimately leading to the displacement of the indigenous faiths of zoroastrianism and manichaeism with islam iran made major contributions to the islamic golden age that followed producing many influential figures in art and science after two centuries a period of various native muslim dynasties began which were later conquered by the turks and the mongols the rise of the safavids in the 15th century led to the reestablishment of a unified iranian state and national identity 4 which followed the country s conversion to shia islam marking a turning point in iranian and muslim history 5 23 by the 18th century under nader shah iran briefly possessed what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time 24 the 19th-century conflicts with the russian empire led to significant territorial losses 25 26 popular unrest culminated in the constitutional revolution of 1906 which established a constitutional monarchy and the country s first legislature following the coup of 1953 iran gradually became closely aligned with the west and grew increasingly autocratic 27 growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression led to the 1979 revolution which followed the establishment of an islamic republic 28 a political system which includes elements of a parliamentary democracy vetted and supervised by a theocracy governed by an autocratic supreme leader 29 during the 1980s the country was engaged in a war with iraq

deteriorated with severe human rights violations being committed by the government against iranian dissidents in several cases several opponents of the current supreme leader ali khamenei have been tortured imprisoned sentenced to death or executed for insulting him iran has responded to denunciation of its human rights record by verbally attacking its critics and harshly criticizing them leading to tensions and anger toward iran from the west 30 since the 2000s iran s controversial nuclear program has raised concerns which is part of the basis of the international sanctions against the country the joint comprehensive plan of action an agreement reached between iran and the p5 1 was created on july 14 2015 aimed to loosen the nuclear sanctions in exchange for iran s restriction

of the persians while persis itself was one of the provinces of ancient iran that is today defined as fars 41 as the most extensive interaction the ancient greeks had with any outsider was with the persians the term persisted even long after the persian rule in greece in 1935 reza shah requested the international community to refer to the country by its native name iran as the new york times explained at the time at the suggestion of the persian legation in berlin the tehran government on the persian new year nowruz march 21 1935 substituted iran for persia as the official name of the country opposition to the name change led to the reversal of the decision and professor ehsan yarshater editor of encyclop dia iranica propagated a move to use persia and iran interchangeably 42 today

plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium bc 63 65 66 during the bronze age the territory of present-day iran was home to several civilizations including elam jiroft and zayanderud elam the most prominent of these civilizations developed in the southwest alongside those in mesopotamia and continued its existence until the emergence of the iranian empires the advent of writing in elam was paralleled to sumer and the elamite cuneiform was developed since the third millennium bc 67 from the 34th to the 20th century bc northwestern iran was part of the kura-araxes culture which stretched into the neighboring caucasus and anatolia since the earliest second millennium bc assyrians settled in swaths of western iran and

assyrian empire based in northern mesopotamia 71 under king cyaxares the medes and persians entered into an alliance with babylonian ruler nabopolassar as well as the fellow iranian scythians and cimmerians and together they attacked the assyrian empire the civil war ravaged the assyrian empire between 616 and 605 bc thus freeing their respective peoples from three centuries of assyrian rule 71 the unification of the median tribes under king deioces in 728 bc led to the foundation of the median empire which by 612 bc controlled almost the entire territory of present-day iran and eastern anatolia 72 this marked the end of the kingdom of urartu as well which was subsequently conquered and dissolved 73 74 in 550 bc cyrus the great the son of mandane and cambyses i took over the median empire and founded the achaemenid empire by unifying other city states the conquest of media was a result of what is called the persian revolt the brouhaha was initially triggered by the actions of median ruler astyages and was quickly spread to other provinces as they allied with the persians later conquests under cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include lydia babylon egypt parts of the balkans and eastern europe proper as well as the lands to the west of the indus and oxus rivers 539 bc was the year in which persian forces defeated the babylonian army at opis and marked the end of around four centuries of mesopotamian domination of the region by conquering the neo-babylonian empire cyrus entered babylon and presented himself as a traditional mesopotamian monarch

the emperor a large professional army and civil services inspiring similar developments in later empires 78 79 eventual conflict on the western borders began with the ionian revolt which erupted into the greco-persian wars and continued through the first half of the fifth century bc and ended with the withdrawal of the achaemenids from all of the territories in the balkans and eastern europe proper 80 in 334 bc alexander the great invaded the achaemenid empire defeating the last achaemenid emperor darius iii at the battle of issus following the premature death of alexander iran came under the control of the hellenistic seleucid empire in the middle of the second century bc the parthian empire rose to become the main power in iran and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry between the romans and the parthians began culminating in the roman parthian wars the parthian empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries until 224 ce when it was succeeded by the sasanian empire 81 together with their neighboring arch-rival the roman-byzantines they made up the world s two most dominant powers at the time for over four centuries 21 22 sasanian rock reliefs at taq bostan in the heart of the zagros mountains the sasanians established an empire within the frontiers achieved by the achaemenids with their capital at ctesiphon late-antiquity sasanian empire is considered one of the most influential periods of iran as their influence reached the culture of ancient rome and through that as far as western europe 82 83 africa 84 china and india 85 and played a prominent role in the formation of the medieval art of both europe and asia 86 a bas-relief at naqsh-e rostam depicting the victory of sasanian ruler shapur i over roman ruler valerian most of the era of the sasanian empire was overshadowed by the roman persian wars which raged on the western borders at anatolia the western caucasus mesopotamia and the levant for over 700 years these wars exhausted both the romans and the sasanians and led to the defeat of both by the muslim invasion throughout the achaemenid parthian and sasanian eras several offshoots of the iranian dynasties established eponymous branches in anatolia and the caucasus including the pontic kingdom the mihranids and the arsacid dynasties of armenia iberia georgia and caucasian albania present-day republic of azerbaijan and southern dagestan medieval period the prolonged byzantine sasanian wars most importantly the climactic war of 602 628 as well as the social conflict within the sasanian empire opened the way for an arab invasion of iran in the seventh century 87 88 the empire was initially defeated by the rashidun caliphate which was succeeded by the umayyad caliphate followed by the abbasid caliphate meanwhile the prolonged and gradual process of islamization was followed which targeted iran s then zoroastrian majority and included religious persecution 89 90 91 demolition of libraries 92 and fire temples 93 a special tax penalty jizya 94 95 and language shift 96 97 in 750 the abbasids overthrew the umayyads notably by the support from the mawali converted iranians 98 the mawali formed the majority of the rebel army which was led by converted iranian general abu muslim 99 100 101 the arrival of the abbasid caliphs saw a relative revival of iranian culture and influence as the role of the old arab aristocracy was partially replaced by a muslim iranian bureaucracy 102 after two centuries of arab rule semi-independent and independent iranian kingdoms including the tahirids saffarids samanids and buyids began to appear on the fringes of the declining abbasid caliphate by the samanid era in the ninth and 10th centuries the efforts of iranians to regain their independence had been well solidified 103 tomb of hafez the popular iranian poet whose works are regarded as a pinnacle in persian literature and have left a considerable mark on later western writers most notably goethe thoreau and emerson 104 105 106 the blossoming literature philosophy medicine and art of iran became major elements in the formation of a new age for the iranian civilization during a period known as the islamic golden age 107 108 the islamic golden age reached its peak by the 10th and 11th centuries during which iran was the main theater of scientific activities 109 after the 10th century persian alongside arabic was used for scientific medical philosophical historical and musical works and renowned iranian writers such as tusi avicenna qotb-od-din shirazi and biruni had major contributions in scientific writing the cultural revival that began in the abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the iranian national identity thus the attempts of arabization never succeeded in iran the shu ubiyya movement became a catalyst for iranians to regain independence in their relations with the arab invaders 110 the most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the persian language attested to the works of epic poet ferdowsi now considered the most prominent figure in iranian literature tu rul tower a 12th-century monument at rhages the 10th century saw a mass migration of turkic tribes from central asia into the iranian plateau 111 turkic tribesmen were first used in the abbasid army as mamluks slave-warriors replacing iranian and arab elements within the army 99 as a result the mamluks gained a significant political power in 999 large portions of iran came briefly under the rule of the ghaznavids whose rulers were of mamluk turkic origin and longer subsequently under the seljuk and khwarezmian empires these dynasties had been persianized and had adopted persian models of administration and rulership 111 the seljuks subsequently gave rise to the sultanate of rum in anatolia while taking their thoroughly persianized identity with them 112 113 the result of the adoption and patronage of iranian culture by turkish rulers was the development of a distinct turko-persian tradition from 1219 to 1221 under the khwarezmian empire iran suffered a devastating invasion by the mongol army of genghis khan according to steven r ward mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the iranian plateau possibly 10 to 15 million people some historians have estimated that iran s population did not again reach its pre-mongol levels until the mid-20th century 114 following the fracture of the mongol empire in 1256 hulagu khan grandson of genghis khan established the ilkhanate in iran in 1370 yet another conqueror timur followed the example of hulagu establishing the timurid empire which lasted for another 156 years in 1387 timur ordered the complete massacre of isfahan reportedly killing 70,000 citizens 115 the ilkhans and the timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the iranians surrounding themselves with a culture that was distinctively iranian 116 early modern period venetian portrait of ismail i the founder of the safavid empire kept at the uffizi by the 1500s ismail i of ardabil established the safavid empire with his capital at tabriz 111 beginning with azerbaijan he subsequently extended his authority over all of the iranian territories and established an intermittent iranian hegemony over the vast relative regions reasserting the iranian identity within large parts of greater iran 117 iran was predominantly sunni 118 but ismail instigated a forced conversion to the shia branch of islam 119 spreading throughout the safavid territories in the caucasus iran anatolia and mesopotamia as a result thereof modern-day iran is the only official shia nation of the world with it holding an absolute majority in iran and the republic of azerbaijan having there the first and the second highest number of shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world 120 121 meanwhile the centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between safavid iran and the neighboring ottoman empire led to numerous ottoman iranian wars 114 a portrait of abbas i the powerful pragmatic safavid ruler who reinforced iran s military political and economic power the safavid era peaked in the reign of abbas i 1587 1629 114 122 surpassing their turkish archrivals in strength and making iran a leading science and art hub in western eurasia the safavid era saw the start of mass integration from caucasian populations into new layers of the society of iran as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of iran playing a pivotal role in the history of iran for centuries onwards following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and the early 1700s which was caused by internal conflicts the continuous wars with the ottomans and the foreign interference most notably the russian interference the safavid rule was ended by the pashtun rebels who besieged isfahan and defeated sultan husayn in 1722 in 1729 nader shah a chieftain and military genius from khorasan successfully drove out and conquered the pashtun invaders he subsequently took back the annexed caucasian territories which were divided among the ottoman and russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in iran during the reign of nader shah iran reached its greatest extent since the sasanian empire reestablishing the iranian hegemony all over the caucasus as well as other major parts of the west and central asia and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time 24 statue of nader shah the powerful afsharid ruler at naderi museum nader shah invaded india and sacked far off delhi by the late 1730s his territorial expansion as well as his military successes went into a decline following the final campaigns in the northern caucasus against then revolting lezgins the assassination of nader shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil after which karim khan of the zand dynasty came to power in 1750 bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity 114 compared to its preceding dynasties the geopolitical reach of the zand dynasty was limited many of the iranian territories in the caucasus gained de facto independence and were locally ruled through various caucasian khanates however despite the self-ruling they all remained subjects and vassals to the zand king 123 the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west 124 another civil war ensued after the death of karim khan in 1779 out of which agha mohammad khan emerged founding the qajar dynasty in 1794 in 1795 following the disobedience of the georgian subjects and their alliance with the russians the qajars captured tbilisi by the battle of krtsanisi and drove the russians out of the entire caucasus reestablishing the iranian suzerainty over the region from the 1800s to the 1940s a map showing the 19th-century northwestern borders of iran comprising modern-day eastern georgia dagestan armenia and the republic of azerbaijan before being ceded to the neighboring russian empire by the russo-iranian wars the russo-iranian wars of 1804 1813 and 1826 1828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for iran in the caucasus comprising all of transcaucasia and dagestan which made part of the very concept of iran for centuries 25 and thus substantial gains for the neighboring russian empire as a result of the 19th-century russo-iranian wars the russians took over the caucasus and iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region comprising modern-day dagestan georgia armenia and republic of azerbaijan which got confirmed per the treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay 26 125 the area to the north of aras river among which the contemporary republic of azerbaijan eastern georgia dagestan and armenia are located were iranian territory until they were occupied by russia in the course of the 19th century 26 126 127 128 129 130 131 as iran shrank many transcaucasian and north caucasian muslims moved towards iran 132 133 especially until the aftermath of the circassian genocide 133 and the decades afterwards while iran s armenians were encouraged to settle in the newly incorporated russian territories 134 135 136 causing significant demographic shifts around 1.5 million people 20 to 25 of the population of iran died as a result of the great famine of 1870 1871 137 the first national iranian parliament established in 1906 between 1872 and 1905 a series of protests took place in response to the sale of concessions to foreigners by qajar monarchs naser-ed-din and mozaffar-ed-din and led to the constitutional revolution in 1905 the first iranian constitution and the first national parliament of iran were founded in 1906 through the ongoing revolution the constitution included the official recognition of iran s three religious minorities namely christians jews and zoroastrians 138 which has remained a basis in the legislation of iran since then the struggle related to the constitutional movement was followed by the triumph of tehran in 1909 when mohammad ali shah was defeated and forced to abdicate on the pretext of restoring order the russians occupied northern iran in 1911 and maintained a military presence in the region for years to come but this did not put an end to the civil uprisings and was soon followed by mirza kuchik khan s jungle movement against both the qajar monarchy and foreign invaders during world war i the british occupied much of the territory of western iran and fully withdrew in 1921 meanwhile a famine in northern iran killed between eight and 10 million people the persian campaign commenced furthermore in northwestern iran after an ottoman invasion as part of the middle eastern theatre of world war i in the course of the assyrian genocide of 1914 1920 and the armenian genocide of 1915 1917 a large number of iranian assyrians and armenians were subjected to mass murders committed by the ottoman troops that were crossing the northwestern border notably in and around khoy maku salmas and urmia 139 140 141 142 143 apart from the rule of agha mohammad khan the qajar rule is characterized as a century of misrule 111 the iranian cossack brigade which was the most effective military force available to the crown began a military coup supported by the british in february 1921 the qajar dynasty was subsequently overthrown and reza khan the former general of the cossack brigade became the new prime minister of iran eventually he was declared the new monarch in 1925 thence known as reza shah establishing the pahlavi dynasty in the midst of world war ii in 1941 nazi germany began the so-called operation barbarossa and invaded the soviet union breaking the molotov ribbentrop pact this had a major impact on iran which had declared neutrality in the conflicts 144 later that year following an anglo-soviet invasion of iran reza shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son mohammad reza pahlavi 145 146 subsequently iran became a major conduit for british and american aid to the soviet union until the end of the ongoing war 147 the allied big three at the 1943 tehran conference at the 1943 tehran conference the allied big three joseph stalin franklin d roosevelt and winston churchill issued the tehran declaration to guarantee the post-war independence and boundaries of iran however at the end of the war soviet troops remained in iran and local pro-soviet groups established two puppet states in north-western iran namely the people s government of azerbaijan and the republic of mahabad receiving a promise of oil concessions the soviets withdrew from iran proper in may 1946 the two puppet states were soon overthrown following the iran crisis of 1946 and the oil concessions were revoked 148 149 contemporary era mohammad mosaddegh iranian democracy advocate and deposed prime minister in 1951 mohammad mosaddegh was appointed as the prime minister he became enormously popular in iran after he nationalized iran s petroleum industry and oil reserves he was deposed in the 1953 iranian coup d tat an anglo-american covert operation that marked the first time the united states had overthrown a foreign government during the cold war 150 mohammad reza pahlavi and the imperial family during the coronation ceremony of the shah of iran in 1967 after the coup the shah became increasingly autocratic and sultanistic and iran entered a phase of decades-long controversial close relations with the united states and some other foreign governments 151 while the shah increasingly modernized iran and claimed to retain it as a fully secular state 27 arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police the savak were used to crush all forms of political opposition ruhollah khomeini a radical muslim cleric became an active critic of the shah s far-reaching series of reforms known as the white revolution khomeini publicly denounced the government and was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months after his release in 1964 he refused to apologize and was eventually sent into exile due to the 1973 spike in oil prices the economy of iran was flooded with foreign currency which caused inflation by 1974 the economy of iran was experiencing double digit inflation and despite the many large projects to modernize the country corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste by 1975 and 1976 an economic recession led to increased unemployment especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s by the late 1970s many of these people opposed the shah s regime and began to organize and join the protests against it 152 ruhollah khomeini s return to iran from exile on february 1 1979 the 1979 revolution later known as the islamic revolution 153 154 155 began in january 1978 with the first major demonstrations against the shah 156 after a year of strikes and demonstrations paralyzing the country and its economy mohammad reza pahlavi fled the country and ruhollah khomeini returned from exile to tehran in february 1979 forming a new government 157 after holding a referendum iran officially became an islamic republic in april 1979 158 a second referendum in december 1979 approved a theocratic constitution 159
