is a space probe launched by nasa on september 5 1977 part of the voyager program to study the outer solar system voyager 1 launched 16 days after its twin voyager 2 having operated for 40 years and 6 months as of march 5 2018 the spacecraft still communicates with the deep space network to receive routine commands and return data at a distance of 141 au 2.11 1010 km approximately 21 billion kilometers 13 billion miles from the sun as of january 2 2018 3 it is the farthest spacecraft and man-made object from earth the probe s objectives included flybys of jupiter saturn and saturn s large moon titan while the spacecraft s course could have been altered to include a pluto encounter by forgoing the titan flyby exploration of the moon which was known to have a substantial atmosphere took priority 4 5 6 it studied the weather magnetic fields and rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons after completing its primary mission with the flyby of saturn on november 12 1980 voyager 1 became the third of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the solar system on august 25 2012 voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium 7 in a further testament to the robustness of voyager 1 the voyager team completed a successful test of the spacecraft s trajectory correction maneuver tcm thrusters on november 28 2017 the last time these backup thrusters were fired up was in november 1980 voyager project manager suzanne dodd anticipates that successful utilization of the tcm thrusters will extend the voyager mission by an additional two to three years 8 voyager 1 s extended mission is expected to continue until around 2025 when its

history edit in the 1960s a grand tour to study the outer planets was proposed which prompted nasa to begin work on a mission in the early 1970s 9 information gathered by the pioneer 10 spacecraft helped voyager s engineers design voyager to cope more effectively with the intense radiation environment around jupiter 10 initially voyager 1 was planned as mariner 11 of the mariner program due to budget cuts the mission was scaled back to be a flyby of jupiter and saturn and renamed the mariner jupiter-saturn probes as the program progressed the name was later changed to voyager since the probe designs began to differ greatly from previous mariner missions 11 spacecraft components edit the 3.7 m 12 ft diameter high gain dish antenna used on the voyager craft voyager 1 was constructed by the jet propulsion laboratory 12 13 14 it has 16 hydrazine thrusters three-axis stabilization gyroscopes and referencing instruments to keep the probe s radio antenna pointed toward earth collectively these instruments are part of the attitude and articulation control subsystem aacs along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters the spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space 15 communication system edit the radio communication system of voyager 1 was designed to be used up to and beyond the limits of the solar system the communication system includes a 3.7-meter 12 ft diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna to send and receive radio waves via the three deep space network stations on the earth 16 the craft normally transmits data to earth over deep space network channel 18 using a frequency of either 2.3 ghz or 8.4 ghz while signals from earth to voyager are transmitted at 2.1 ghz 17 when voyager 1 is unable to communicate directly with the earth its digital tape recorder dtr can record about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time 18 signals from voyager 1 take over 19 hours to reach earth 3 power edit voyager 1 has three radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs mounted on a boom each mhw-rtg contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres 19 the rtgs generated about 470 w of electric power at the time of launch with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat 20 the power output of the rtgs declines over time due to the 87.7-year half-life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples but the craft s rtgs will continue to support some of its operations until 2025 15 19 diagram of rtg fuel container showing the plutonium-238 oxide spheres diagram of rtg shell showing the power-producing silicon-germanium thermocouples model of an rtg unit as of march 5 2018 voyager 1 has 72.61 of the plutonium-238 that it had at launch by 2050 it will have 56.5 left computers edit unlike the other onboard instruments the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on-board digital computers the flight data subsystem fds since the 1990s space probes usually have completely autonomous cameras 21 the computer command subsystem ccs controls the cameras the ccs contains fixed computer programs such as command decoding fault detection and correction routines antenna pointing routines and spacecraft sequencing routines this computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the 1970s viking orbiters 22 the hardware in both custom-built ccs subsystems in the voyagers is identical there is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks citation needed the attitude and articulation control subsystem aacs controls the spacecraft orientation its attitude it keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards the earth controls attitude changes and points the scan platform the custom-built aacs systems on both voyagers are the same 23

launch complex 41 at the cape canaveral air force station aboard a titan iiie launch vehicle the voyager 2 probe had been launched two weeks earlier on august 20 1977 despite being launched later voyager 1 reached both jupiter 28 and saturn sooner following a shorter trajectory 29 flyby of jupiter edit voyager 1 began photographing jupiter in january 1979 its closest approach to jupiter was on march 5 1979 at a distance of about 349,000 kilometers 217,000 miles from the planet s center 28 because of the greater photographic resolution allowed by a closer approach most observations of the moons rings magnetic fields and the radiation belt environment of the jovian system were made during the 48-hour period that bracketed the closest approach voyager 1 finished photographing the jovian system in april 1979 discovery of active volcanic activity on the moon io was probably the greatest surprise it was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the solar system it appears that activity on io affects the entire jovian system io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the jovian magnetosphere the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet s strong magnetic field sulfur oxygen and sodium apparently erupted by io s volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles were detected at the outer edge of the magnetosphere of jupiter 28 the two voyager space probes made a number of important discoveries about jupiter its satellites its radiation belts and its never-before-seen planetary

flyby of saturn edit the gravitational assist trajectories at jupiter were successfully carried out by both voyagers and the two spacecraft went on to visit saturn and its system of moons and rings voyager 1 encountered saturn in november 1980 with the closest approach on november 12 1980 when the space probe came within 124,000 kilometers 77,000 mi of saturn s cloud-tops the space probe s cameras detected complex structures in the rings of saturn and its remote sensing instruments studied the atmospheres of saturn and its giant moon titan 30 voyager 1 found that about seven percent of the volume of saturn s upper atmosphere is helium compared with 11 percent of jupiter s atmosphere while almost all the rest is hydrogen since saturn s internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as jupiter s and the sun s the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through saturn s hydrogen that might explain the excess heat that saturn radiates over energy it receives from the sun winds blow at high speeds in saturn near the equator the voyagers measured winds about 500 m s 1,100 mph the wind blows mostly in an easterly direction 29 the voyagers found aurora-like ultraviolet emissions of hydrogen at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere and auroras at polar latitudes above 65 degrees the high-level auroral activity may lead to the formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator the mid-latitude auroras which occur only in sunlit regions remain a puzzle since bombardment by electrons and ions known to cause auroras on earth occurs primarily at high latitudes both voyagers measured the rotation of saturn the length of a day at 10 hours 39 minutes 24 seconds 30 voyager 1 s mission included a flyby of titan saturn s largest moon which had long been known to have an atmosphere images taken by pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex further increasing interest the titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to saturn compromising observations and approached to within 6,400 km 4,000 mi passing behind titan as seen from earth and the sun voyager s measurement of the atmosphere s effect on sunlight and earth-based measurement of its effect on the probe s radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere s composition density and pressure titan s mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe s trajectory thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface but the measurement of the atmosphere s composition temperature and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface 31 because observations of titan were considered vital the trajectory chosen for voyager 1 was designed around the optimum titan flyby which took it below the south pole of saturn and out of the plane of the ecliptic ending its planetary science mission 32 had voyager 1 failed or been unable to observe titan voyager 2 s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the titan flyby 31 94 precluding any visit to uranus and neptune 4 the trajectory voyager 1 was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to uranus and neptune 32 155 but could have been altered to avoid a titan flyby and travel from saturn to pluto arriving in 1986 6 crescent saturn from 5.3 million km four days after closest approach voyager 1 image of saturn s narrow twisted and braided f ring mimas at a range of 425,000 km the crater

saturn encounter at wikimedia commons exit from the heliosphere edit the family portrait of the solar system acquired by voyager 1 position of voyager 1 above the plane of the ecliptic on february 14 1990 on february 14 1990 voyager 1 took the first ever family portrait of the solar system as seen from outside 33 which includes the image of planet earth known as pale blue dot soon afterward its cameras were deactivated to conserve power and computer resources for other equipment the camera software has been removed from the spacecraft so it would now be complex to get them working again earth-side software and computers for reading the images are also no longer available 4 the pale blue dot image showing earth from 6 billion kilometers appearing as a tiny dot the blueish-white speck approximately halfway down the brown band to the right within the darkness of deep space on february 17 1998 voyager 1 reached a distance of 69 au from the sun and overtook pioneer 10 as the most distant spacecraft from earth 34 35 travelling at about 17 kilometers per second 11 mi s 36 it has the fastest heliocentric recession speed of any spacecraft 37 as voyager 1 headed for interstellar space its instruments continued to study the solar system jet propulsion laboratory scientists used the plasma wave experiments aboard voyager 1 and 2 to look for the heliopause the boundary at which the solar wind transitions into the interstellar medium 38 as of 2013 the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the sun of about 17030 m s 39 with the velocity the probe is currently maintaining voyager 1 is traveling about 325 million miles per year 520 million kilometers per year 40 or approximately half a light-year per ten millennia termination shock edit close flybys of gas giants gave gravity assists to both voyagers scientists at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory think that voyager 1 entered the termination shock in february 2003 41 this marks the point where the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds some other scientists expressed doubt discussed in the journal nature of november 6 2003 42 the issue would not be resolved until other data became available since voyager 1 s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990 this failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board 43 44 45 in may 2005 a nasa press release said that the consensus was that voyager 1 was then in the heliosheath 46 in a scientific session at the american geophysical union meeting in new orleans on the morning of may 25 2005 dr ed stone presented evidence that the craft crossed the termination shock in late 2004 47 this event is estimated to have occurred on december 15 2004 at a distance of 94 au from the sun 47 48 heliosheath edit on march 31 2006 amateur radio operators from amsat in germany tracked and received radio waves from voyager 1 using the 20-meter 66 ft dish at bochum with a long integration technique retrieved data was checked and verified against data from the deep space network station at madrid spain 49 this seems to be the first such amateur tracking of voyager 1 49 it was confirmed on december 13 2010 that voyager 1 had passed the reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind as measured by the low energy charged particle device it is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere since june 2010 detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero providing conclusive evidence of the event 50 51 on this date the spacecraft was approximately 116 au or 10.8 billion miles 17.3 billion kilometers from the sun 52 voyager 1 was commanded to change its orientation to measure the sideways motion of the solar wind at that location in space on march 2011 a test roll done in february had confirmed the spacecraft s ability to maneuver and reorient itself the course of the spacecraft was not changed it rotated 70 degrees counterclockwise with respect to earth to detect the solar wind this was the first time the spacecraft had done any major maneuvering since the family portrait photograph of the planets was taken in 1990 after the first roll the spacecraft had no problem in reorienting itself with alpha centauri voyager 1 s guide star and it resumed sending transmissions back to earth voyager 1 was expected to enter interstellar space at any time voyager 2 was still detecting outward flow of solar wind at that point but it was estimated that in the following months or years it would experience the same conditions as voyager 1 53 54 the spacecraft was reported at 12.44 declination and 17.163 hours right ascension and at an ecliptic latitude of 34.9 the ecliptic latitude changes very slowly placing it in the constellation ophiuchus as observed from the earth on may 21 2011 4 on december 1 2011 it was announced that voyager 1 had detected the first lyman-alpha radiation originating from the milky way galaxy lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies but because of interference from the sun the radiation from the milky way was not detectable 55 nasa announced on december 5 2011 that voyager 1 had entered a new region referred to as a cosmic purgatory within this stagnation region charged particles streaming from the sun slow and turn inward and the solar system s magnetic field is doubled in strength as interstellar space appears to be applying pressure energetic particles originating in the solar system decline by nearly half while the detection of high-energy electrons from outside increases 100-fold the inner edge of the stagnation region is located approximately 113 au from the sun 56 heliopause edit plot showing a dramatic increase in the rate of cosmic ray particle detection by the voyager 1 spacecraft october 2011 through october 2012 plot showing a dramatic decrease in the rate of solar wind particle detection by voyager 1 october 2011 through october 2012 nasa announced in june 2012 that the probe was detecting changes in the environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause 57 voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the sun the craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium at the edge of the solar system 58 voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause in august 2012 then at a distance of 121 au from the sun although this was not confirmed for another year 59 60 61 62 63 as of september 2012 sunlight took 16.89 hours to get to voyager 1 which was at a distance of 121 au the apparent magnitude of the sun from the spacecraft was 16.3 less than 30 times the brightness of the full moon 64 the spacecraft was traveling at 17.043 km s 10.590 mi s relative to the sun it would need about 17,565 years at this speed to travel a light-year 64 to compare proxima centauri the closest star to the sun is about 4.2 light-years 7016396434357355000 2.65 105 au distant were the spacecraft traveling in the direction of that star 73,775 years would pass before voyager 1 reaches it voyager 1 is heading in the direction of the constellation ophiuchus 64 in late 2012 researchers reported that particle data from the spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since may in collisions with high energy particles above 70 mev which are thought to be cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond the solar system with a sharp increase in these collisions in late august at the same time in late august there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low-energy particles which are thought to originate from the sun 65 ed roelof space scientist at johns hopkins university and principal investigator for the low-energy charged particle instrument on the spacecraft declared that most scientists involved with voyager 1 would agree that these two criteria have been sufficiently satisfied 65 however the last criterion for officially declaring that voyager 1 had crossed the boundary the expected change in magnetic field direction from that of the sun to that of the interstellar field beyond had not been observed the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees 60 which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the heliosphere had been misjudged on december 3 2012 voyager project scientist ed stone of the california institute of technology said voyager has discovered a new region of the heliosphere that we had not realized was there we re still inside apparently but the magnetic field now is connected to the outside so it s like a highway letting particles in and out 66 the magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than voyager 1 encountered before the termination shock it was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the solar system completely and entered interstellar space 67 68 69 in march 2013 it was announced that voyager 1 might have become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on august 25 2012 however until september 12 2013 it was still an open question as to whether the new region was interstellar space or an unknown region of the solar system at that time the former alternative was officially confirmed 70 71 in 2013 voyager 1 was exiting the solar system at a speed of about 3.6 au per year while voyager 2 is going slower leaving the solar system at 3.3 au per year 72 each year voyager 1 increases its lead over voyager 2 voyager 1 reached a distance of 135 au from the sun on may 18 2016 3 by september 5 2017 that had increased to about 139.64 au from the sun or just over 19 light-hours and at that time voyager 2 was 115.32 au from the sun 3 its progress can be monitored at nasa s website see external links 3 voyager 1 and the other probes that are in or on their way to interstellar space interstellar medium edit on september 12 2013 nasa officially confirmed that voyager 1 had reached the interstellar medium in august 2012 as previously observed with a generally accepted date of august 25 2012 the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected 61 62 63 by this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause 62 a new model of the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found 73 a key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on april 9 2013 62 triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in march 2012 59 electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within 61 weaker sets of oscillations measured in october and november 2012 71 74 provided additional data an indirect measurement was required because voyager 1 s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980 63 in september 2013 nasa released audio renditions of these plasma waves the recordings represent the first sounds to be captured in interstellar space 75 while voyager 1 is commonly spoken of as having left the solar system simultaneously with having left the heliosphere the two are not the same the solar system is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the sun the craft is presently less than one seventh the distance to the aphelion of sedna and it has not yet entered the oort cloud the source region of long-period comets regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the solar system 60 71 future of the probe edit image of voyager 1 s radio signal on february 21 2013 76 voyager 1 is expected to reach the theorized oort cloud in about 300 years 77 78 and take about 30,000 years to pass through it 60 71 though it is not heading towards any particular star in about 40,000 years it will pass within 1.6 light-years of the star gliese 445 which is at present in the constellation camelopardalis 79 that star is generally moving towards the solar system at about 119 km s 430,000 km h 270,000 mph 79 nasa says that the voyagers are destined perhaps eternally to wander the milky way 80 provided voyager 1 does not collide with anything and is not retrieved the new horizons space probe will never pass it despite being launched from earth at a faster speed than either voyager spacecraft new horizons is traveling at about 15 km s 2 km s slower than voyager 1 and is still slowing down when new horizons reaches the same distance from the sun as voyager 1 is now its speed will be about 13 km s 8 mi s 81 in december 2017 it was announced that nasa had successfully fired up all four of voyager 1 s trajectory correction maneuver tcm thrusters the tcm thrusters will be used in the place of a degraded set of jets which were used to help keep the probe s antenna pointed towards the earth use of the tcm thrusters will allow voyager 1 to continue to transmit data to nasa for two to three more years 82 83 year end of specific capabilities as a result of the available electrical power limitations 84 2007 termination of plasma subsystem pls 2008 power off planetary radio astronomy experiment pra 2016 85 termination of scan platform and ultraviolet spectrometer uvs observations 2018 approx termination of data tape recorder dtr operations limited by ability to capture 1.4 kbit s data using a 70 m 34 m antenna array this is the minimum rate at which the dtr can read out data 2019-2020 approx termination of gyroscopic operations previously 2017 but backup thrusters active for continuation of gyroscopic operations 2020 start shutdown of science instruments as of october 18 2010 the order is undecided but the low-energy charged particles cosmic ray subsystem magnetometer and plasma wave subsystem instruments are expected to still be operating 86 2025 2030 will no longer be able to power any single instrument golden record edit a child s greeting in english recorded on the voyager
