than the upper and lower layers picture taken at the san diego natural history museum complex cretaceous paleogene clay layer gray in the geulhemmergroeve tunnels near geulhem the netherlands finger is below the actual cretaceous-paleogene boundary the cretaceous paleogene k pg extinction event a also known as the cretaceous tertiary k t extinction b was a mass extinction of some three-quarters of the plant and animal species on earth that occurred over a geologically short period of time 2 3 4 approximately 66 million years ago 3 with the exception of some ectothermic species such as the leatherback sea turtle and crocodiles no tetrapods weighing more than 25 kilograms 55 lb survived 5 it marked the end of the cretaceous period and with it the entire mesozoic era opening the cenozoic era that continues today in the geologic record the k pg event is marked by a thin layer of sediment called the k pg boundary which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks the boundary clay shows high levels of the metal iridium which is rare in the earth s crust but abundant in asteroids 6 as originally proposed in 1980 by a team of scientists led by luis alvarez and walter alvarez it is now generally thought that the k pg extinction was caused by a massive comet or asteroid impact estimated to be 10 km 6.2 mi to 15 km 9.3 mi wide 7 8 66 million years ago 3 and its catastrophic effects on the global environment including a lingering impact winter that made it impossible for plants and plankton to carry out photosynthesis 9 10 the impact hypothesis also known as the alvarez hypothesis was bolstered by the discovery of the 180-kilometre-wide 112 mi chicxulub crater in the gulf of mexico in the early 1990s 11 which provided conclusive evidence that the k pg boundary clay represented debris from an asteroid impact 12 the fact that the extinctions occurred at the same time as the impact provides strong situational evidence that the k pg extinction was caused by the asteroid 12 possibly it was accelerated by the creation of the deccan traps however some scientists maintain the extinction was caused or exacerbated by other factors such as volcanic eruptions 13 climate change or sea level change separately or together a 2016 drilling project into the chicxulub peak ring confirmed that the peak ring comprised granite ejected within minutes from deep in the earth rather than usual seafloor rock and evidence of colossal seawater movement directly afterwards from layered sand deposits crucially the cores also showed a nearly complete absence of gypsum the usual sea floor rock in the region which is sulfate-containing this would have been vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere providing evidence of a probable link between the impact and a global scale of longer-term effects on the climate and food chain a wide range of species perished in the k pg extinction the best-known victims are the non-avian dinosaurs the extinction also destroyed a plethora of other terrestrial organisms however including certain mammals pterosaurs birds 14 lizards 15 insects 16 17 and plants 18 in the oceans the k pg extinction killed off plesiosaurs and the giant marine lizards mosasauridae and devastated fish 19 sharks mollusks especially ammonites which became extinct and many species of plankton it is estimated that 75 or more of all species on earth vanished 20 yet the devastation caused by the extinction also provided evolutionary opportunities in the wake of the extinction many groups underwent remarkable adaptive radiations a sudden and prolific divergence into new forms and species within the disrupted and emptied ecological niches resulting from the event mammals in particular diversified in the paleogene 21 producing new forms such as horses whales bats and primates birds 22 fish 23 and perhaps lizards 15 also radiated contents 1 microbiota 2 extinction patterns 2.1 marine invertebrates 2.2

calcareous nanoplankton that formed the calcium deposits that gave the cretaceous its name the turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level 24 25 statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions than by a decrease in speciation 26 the k pg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages thereby likely causing diversity to be underestimated 27 recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer 28 extinction patterns edit marine extinction intensity during the phanerozoic millions of years ago h k

see extinction event for more details source and image info the k pg extinction event was severe global rapid and selective in terms of severity the event eliminated a vast number of species based on marine fossils it is estimated that 75 or more of all species were made extinct by the k pg extinction event 20 the event appears to have affected all continents at the same time non-avian dinosaurs for example are known from the maastrichtian of north america europe asia africa south america and antarctica 29 but are unknown from the cenozoic anywhere in the world similarly fossil pollen shows devastation of the plant communities in areas as far apart as new mexico alaska china and new zealand 18 even though the boundary event was severe there was significant variability in the rate of extinction between and within different clades species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the earth this plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups 30 omnivores insectivores and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources no purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived rather the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects worms and snails which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus non-living organic material 27 31 32 in stream communities few animal groups became extinct because such communities rely less directly on food from living plants and more on detritus that washes in from the land buffering them from extinction 33 similar but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans extinction was more severe among animals living in the water column than among animals living on or in the sea floor animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton while animals living on or in the ocean floor feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding 27 coccolithophorids and mollusks including ammonites rudists freshwater snails and mussels and those organisms whose food chain included these shell builders became extinct or suffered heavy losses for example it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary 34 the largest air-breathing survivors of the event crocodyliforms and champsosaurs were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus modern crocodilians can live as scavengers can survive for months without food and their young are small grow slowly and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years these characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the cretaceous 31 after the k pg extinction event biodiversity required substantial time to recover despite the existence of abundant vacant ecological niches 27 radiolaria have left a geological record since at least the ordovician times and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the k pg boundary there is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early paleocene 27 approximately 46 of diatom species survived the transition from the cretaceous to the upper paleocene this suggests a significant turnover in species but not a catastrophic extinction of diatoms across the k pg boundary 27 35 the occurrence of planktonic foraminifera across the k pg boundary has been studied since the 1930s 36 research spurred by the possibility of an impact event at the k pg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at the boundary 27 however there is debate ongoing between groups that think the evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the k pg boundary 37 and those who think the evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the boundary 38 39 numerous species of benthic foraminifera became extinct during the k pg extinction event presumably because they depend on organic debris for nutrients since the biomass in the ocean is thought to have decreased as the marine microbiota recovered however it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources 27 phytoplankton recovery in the early paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages which are mainly detritus-feeding ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early paleocene 40 41 marine invertebrates edit discoscaphites iris ammonite from the owl creek formation upper cretaceous owl creek ripley mississippi there is significant variation in the fossil record as to the extinction rate of marine invertebrates across the k pg boundary the apparent rate is influenced by a lack of fossil records rather than extinctions 27 ostracods a class of small crustaceans that were prevalent in the upper maastrichtian left fossil deposits in a variety of locations a review of these fossils shows that ostracod diversity was lower in the paleocene than any other time in the cenozoic current research cannot ascertain however whether the extinctions occurred prior to or during the boundary interval 42 43 approximately 60 of late-cretaceous scleractinia coral genera failed to cross the k pg boundary into the paleocene further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98 of colonial species ones that inhabit warm shallow tropical waters became extinct the solitary corals which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper below the photic zone areas of the ocean were less impacted by the k pg boundary colonial coral species rely upon symbiosis with photosynthetic algae which collapsed due to the events surrounding the k pg boundary 44 45 however the use of data from coral fossils to support k pg extinction and subsequent paleocene recovery must be weighed against the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the k pg boundary 27 the numbers of cephalopod echinoderm and bivalve genera exhibited significant diminution after the k pg boundary 27 most species of brachiopods a small phylum of marine invertebrates survived the k pg extinction event and diversified during the early paleocene rudist bivalves from the late cretaceous of the omani mountains united arab emirates scale bar is 10 mm except for nautiloids represented by the modern order nautilida and coleoids which had already diverged into modern octopodes squids and cuttlefish all other species of the molluscan class cephalopoda became extinct at the k pg boundary these included the ecologically significant belemnoids as well as the ammonoids a group of highly diverse numerous and widely distributed shelled cephalopods researchers have pointed out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving nautiloids which rely upon few and larger eggs played a role in outsurviving their ammonoid counterparts through the extinction event the ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction numerous eggs and planktonic larvae which would have been devastated by the k pg extinction event additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids 46 47 approximately 35 of echinoderm genera became extinct at the k pg boundary although taxa that thrived in low-latitude shallow-water environments during the late cretaceous had the highest extinction rate mid-latitude deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the k pg boundary the pattern of extinction points to habitat loss specifically the drowning of carbonate platforms the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time by the extinction event 48 other invertebrate groups including rudists reef-building clams and inoceramids giant relatives of modern scallops also became extinct at the k pg boundary 49 50 fish edit this article needs attention from an expert in palaeontology or fish the specific problem is the paragraph on sharks and survival through the k-t event simply does not make sense it contradicts the article on sharks and self-contradicts it also requires some language cleanup wikiproject palaeontology or wikiproject fish may be able to help recruit an expert march 2017 there are substantial fossil records of jawed fishes across the k pg boundary which provide good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates while the deep sea realm was able to remain seemingly unaffected there was an equal loss between the open marine apex predators and the durophagous demersal feeders on the continental shelf within cartilaginous fish approximately 7 out of the 41 families of neoselachians modern sharks skates and rays disappeared after this event and batoids skates and rays lost nearly all the identifiable species while more than 90 of teleost fish bony fish families survived 51 52 in the maastrichtian age 28 shark families and 13 batoid families thrived of which 25 and 9 respectively survived the k-t boundary event 47 of all neoselachian genera cross the k t boundary with 85 being sharks batoids display with 15 a comparably low survival rate 51 53 there is evidence of a mass extinction of bony fishes at a fossil site immediately above the k pg boundary layer on seymour island near antarctica apparently precipitated by the k pg extinction event 54 however the marine and freshwater environments of fishes mitigated environmental effects of the extinction event 55 terrestrial invertebrates edit insect damage to the fossilized leaves of flowering plants from fourteen sites in north america were used as a proxy for insect diversity across the k pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction researchers found that cretaceous sites prior to the extinction event had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity during the early paleocene however flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects even 1.7 million years after the extinction event 56 57 terrestrial plants edit there is overwhelming evidence of global disruption of plant communities at the k pg boundary 18 18 58 59 extinctions are seen both in studies of fossil pollen and fossil leaves 18 in north america the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the k pg boundary sections although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary 18 60 in north america approximately 57 of plant species became extinct in high southern hemisphere latitudes such as new zealand and antarctica the mass die-off of flora caused no significant turnover in species but dramatic and short-term changes in the relative abundance of plant groups 56 61 in some regions the paleocene recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species represented as a fern spike in the geologic record this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after the 1980 mount st helens eruption 62 due to the wholesale destruction of plants at the k pg boundary there was a proliferation of saprotrophic organisms such as fungi that do not require photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation the dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present once the atmosphere cleared photosynthetic organisms such as ferns and other plants returned 63 polyploidy appears to have enhanced the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact 64 amphibians edit there is limited evidence for extinction of amphibians at the k pg boundary a study of fossil vertebrates across the k pg boundary in montana concluded that no species of amphibian became extinct 65 yet there are several species of maastrichtian amphibian not included as part of this study which are unknown from the paleocene these include the frog theatonius lancensis 66 and the albanerpetontid albanerpeton galaktion 67 therefore some amphibians do seem to have become extinct at the boundary the relatively low levels of extinction seen among amphibians probably reflect the low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals 68 non-archosaurs edit kronosaurus hunt by dmitry bogdanov 2008 large marine reptiles including plesiosaurians such as these became extinct at the end of the cretaceous choristodere edit the choristoderes semi-aquatic archosauromorphs survived across the k pg boundary 27 but would die out in the early miocene turtles edit more than 80 of cretaceous turtle species passed through the k pg boundary additionally all six turtle families in existence at the end of the cretaceous survived into the paleogene and are represented by living species 69 lepidosauria edit the living non-archosaurian reptile taxa lepidosaurians lizards and tuataras survived across the k pg boundary 27 living lepidosaurs include the tuataras the only living rhynchocephalians and the squamates the rhynchocephalians were a widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurians during the early mesozoic but began to decline by the mid-cretaceous although they were very successful in the late cretaceous of south america 70 they are represented today by a single genus located exclusively in new zealand 71 the order squamata which is represented today by lizards including snakes and amphisbaenians worm lizards radiated into various ecological niches during the jurassic and was successful throughout the cretaceous they survived through the k pg boundary and are currently the most successful and diverse group of living reptiles with more than 6,000 extant species many families of terrestrial squamates became extinct at the boundary such as monstersaurians and polyglyphanodonts and fossil evidence indicates they suffered very heavy losses in the kt event only recovering 10 million years after it 72 giant non-archosaurian aquatic reptiles such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs which were the top marine predators of their time became extinct by the end of the cretaceous 73 74 the ichthyosaurs had disappeared from fossil records before the mass extinction occurred archosaurs edit the archosaur clade includes two surviving groups crocodilians and birds along with the various extinct groups of non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs 75 crocodyliforms edit ten families of crocodilians or their close relatives are represented in the maastrichtian fossil records of which five died out prior to the k pg boundary 76 five families have both maastrichtian and paleocene fossil representatives all of the surviving families of crocodyliforms inhabited freshwater and terrestrial environments except for the dyrosauridae which lived in freshwater and marine locations approximately 50 of crocodyliform representatives survived across the k pg boundary the only apparent trend being that no large crocodiles survived 27 crocodyliform survivability across the boundary may have resulted from their aquatic niche and ability to burrow which reduced susceptibility to negative environmental effects at the boundary 55 jouve and colleagues suggested in 2008 that juvenile marine crocodyliforms lived in freshwater environments as do modern marine crocodile juveniles which would have helped them survive where other marine reptiles became extinct freshwater environments were not so strongly affected by the k pg extinction event as marine environments were 77 choristodera edit the choristodera a generally crocodile-like group of uncertain phylogeny possibly archosaurian also survived the event only to become extinct in the miocene 78 studies on champsosaurus palatal teeth suggest that there were dietary changes among the various species across the kt event 79 pterosaurs edit one family of pterosaurs azhdarchidae was definitely present in the maastrichtian and it likely became extinct at the k pg boundary these large pterosaurs were the last representatives of a declining group that contained ten families during the mid-cretaceous several other pterosaur lineages may have been present during the maastrichtian such as the ornithocheirids pteranodontids nyctosaurids as well as a possible tapejarid though they are represented by fragmentary remains that are difficult to assign to any given group 80 81 while this was occurring modern birds were undergoing diversification traditionally it was thought that they replaced archaic birds and pterosaur groups possibly due to direct competition or they simply filled empty niches 55 82 83 but there is no correlation between pterosaur and avian diversities that are conclusive to a competition hypothesis 84 and small pterosaurs were present in the late cretaceous 85 birds edit most paleontologists regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs see origin of birds it is thought that all non-avian theropods became extinct including then-flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and hesperornithiforms 86 several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the k pg boundary and that duck chicken and ratite bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs 87 large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the k pg boundary the absence of these birds in the paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there a small fraction of the cretaceous bird species survived the impact giving rise to today s birds 14 88 the only bird group known for certain to have survived the k pg boundary is the aves 14 avians may have been able to survive the extinction as a result of their abilities to dive swim or seek shelter in water and marshlands many species of avians can build burrows or nest in tree holes or termite nests all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the k pg boundary long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs 55 non-avian dinosaurs edit tyrannosaurus was among the dinosaurs living on earth before the extinction excluding a few controversial claims scientists agree that all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the k pg boundary the dinosaur fossil record has been interpreted to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity during the last few million years of the cretaceous and it may be that the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options 89 there is no evidence that late maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow swim or dive which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the k pg boundary it is possible that small dinosaurs other than birds did survive but they would have been deprived of food as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply 55 the growing consensus about the endothermy of dinosaurs see dinosaur physiology helps to understand their full extinction in contrast with their close relatives the crocodilians ectothermic cold-blooded crocodiles have very limited needs for food they can survive several months without eating while endothermic warm-blooded animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism thus under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned non-avian dinosaurs died 30 while some crocodiles survived in this context the survival of other endothermic animals such as some birds and mammals could be due among other reasons to their smaller needs for food related to their small size at the extinction epoch 90 whether the extinction occurred gradually or suddenly has been debated as both views have support from the fossil record a study of 29 fossil sites in catalan pyrenees of europe in 2010 supports the view that dinosaurs there had great diversity until the asteroid impact with more than 100 living species 91 more recent research indicates that this figure is obscured by taphonomical biases however and the sparsity of the continental fossil record the results of this study which were based on estimated real global biodiversity showed that between 628 and 1,078 non-avian dinosaur species were alive at the end of the cretaceous and underwent sudden extinction after the cretaceous paleogene extinction event 92 alternatively interpretation based on the fossil-bearing rocks along the red deer river in alberta canada supports the gradual extinction of non-avian dinosaurs during the last 10 million years of the cretaceous layers there the number of dinosaur species seems to have decreased from about 45 to approximately 12 other scientists have made the same assessment following their research 93 several researchers support the existence of paleocene dinosaurs evidence of this existence is based on the discovery of dinosaur remains in the hell creek formation up to 1.3 m 4.3 ft above and 40,000 years later than the k pg boundary 94 pollen samples recovered near a fossilized hadrosaur femur recovered in the ojo alamo sandstone at the san juan river in colorado indicate that the animal lived during the cenozoic approximately 7015203546520000000 64.5 ma about 1 million years after the k pg extinction event if their existence past the k pg boundary can be confirmed these hadrosaurids would be considered a dead clade walking 95 scientific consensus however is that these fossils were eroded from their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments also known as reworked fossils 96 mammals edit all major cretaceous mammalian lineages including monotremes egg-laying mammals multituberculates metatherians eutherians dryolestoideans 97 and gondwanatheres 98 survived the k pg extinction event although they suffered losses in particular metatherians largely disappeared from north america and the asian deltatheroidans became extinct 99 in the hell creek beds of north america at least half of the ten known multituberculate species and all eleven metatherians species are not found above the boundary 89 multituberculates in europe and north america survived relatively unscathed and quickly bounced back in the palaeocene but asian forms were decimated never again to represent a significant component on mammalian faunas 100 mammalian species began diversifying approximately 30 million years prior to the k pg boundary diversification of mammals stalled across the boundary 101 current research indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the k pg boundary despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs 102 several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the k pg boundary including chiroptera bats and cetartiodactyla a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and even-toed ungulates 102 although recent research concludes that only marsupial orders diversified after the k pg boundary 101 k pg boundary mammalian species were generally small comparable in size to rats this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments in addition it is postulated that some early monotremes marsupials and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from k pg boundary environmental stresses 55 evidence edit north american fossils edit hell creek formation in north american terrestrial sequences the extinction event is best represented by the marked discrepancy between the rich and relatively abundant late-maastrichtian palynomorph record and the post-boundary fern spike 58 at present the most informative sequence of dinosaur-bearing rocks in the world from the k pg boundary is found in western north america particularly the late maastrichtian-age hell creek formation of montana this formation when compared with the older approximately 75 ma judith river dinosaur park formations from montana and alberta respectively provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10 million years of the cretaceous these fossil beds are geographically limited covering only part of one continent 89 the middle late campanian formations show a greater diversity of dinosaurs than any other single group of rocks the late maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades tyrannosaurus ankylosaurus pachycephalosaurus triceratops and torosaurus 103 which suggests food was plentiful immediately prior to the extinction in addition to rich dinosaur fossils there are also plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the k pg boundary in the sediments below the k pg boundary the dominant plant remains are angiosperm pollen grains but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores 104 more usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer this is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions where the recovery is led by ferns which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants 105 marine fossils edit the mass extinction of marine plankton appears to have been abrupt and right at the k pg boundary 106 ammonite genera became extinct at or near the k pg boundary however there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late cretaceous marine regression the gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the k pg boundary and a small gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late cretaceous 107 further analysis shows that several processes were in progress in the late cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time then ended with the abrupt mass extinction 107 the diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the k-t boundary increased in temperature the temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65.4 and 65.2 million years ago which is around the time of the extinction event not only did the climate temperature increase but the water temperature decreased causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity 108 megatsunamis edit the scientific consensus is that the asteroid impact at the k pg boundary left megatsunami deposits and sediments around the area of the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico from the colossal waves created by the impact 109 these deposits have been identified in the la popa basin in northeastern mexico 110 platform carbonates in northeastern brazil 111 in atlantic deep-sea sediments 112 and in the form of the thickest-known layer of graded sand deposits around 100m thick in the chicxulub crater itself directly above the shocked granite ejecta the megatsunami has been estimated to be more than 100 metres 330 ft tall as the asteroid fell in an area of relatively shallow sea in deep sea it would have been 4.6 kilometres 2.9 mi tall 113 duration edit the length of time taken for the extinction to occur is a controversial issue because some theories about the extinction s causes require a rapid extinction over a relatively short period from a few years to a few thousand years while others require longer periods the issue is difficult to resolve because of the signor lipps effect that is the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found 114 scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the k pg extinction to a few million years after it 27 the sedimentation rate and thickness of k-pg clay from three sites suggest short duration of event perhaps less than ten thousand years 115 chicxulub impact edit evidence for impact edit location of chicxulub crater mexico in 1980 a team of researchers consisting of nobel prize winning physicist luis alvarez his son geologist walter alvarez and chemists frank asaro and helen michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the cretaceous paleogene boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal 30 160 and 20 times in three sections originally studied iridium is extremely rare in earth s crust because it is a siderophile element and therefore most of it traveled with the iron as it sank into earth s core during planetary differentiation as iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets the alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the earth at the time of the k pg boundary 9 there were earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event but this was the first hard evidence of an impact 116 the k pg boundary exposure in trinidad lake state park in the raton basin of colorado shows an abrupt change from dark- to light-colored rock white line added to mark the transition this hypothesis was viewed as radical when first proposed but additional evidence soon emerged the boundary clay was found to be full of minute spherules of rock crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact 117 shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the k pg boundary 118 119 shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts the identification of giant tsunami beds along the gulf coast and the caribbean also provided evidence for impact 120 and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby as did the discovery that the k pg boundary became thicker in the southern united states with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern new mexico 18 radar topography reveals the 180 km wide 112 mi ring of the chicxulub crater further research identified the giant chicxulub crater buried under chicxulub on the coast of yucat n as the source of the k pg boundary clay identified in 1990 11 based on work by geophysicist glen penfield in 1978 the crater is oval with an average diameter of roughly 180 kilometres 110 mi about the size calculated by the alvarez team 121 the discovery of the crater a necessary prediction of the impact hypothesis provided conclusive evidence for a k pg impact and strengthened the hypothesis that the extinction was caused by an impact in 2007 a hypothesis was put forth that argued the impactor that killed the dinosaurs belonged to the baptistina family of asteroids 122 concerns have been raised regarding the reputed link in part because very few solid observational constraints exist of the asteroid or family 123 indeed it was recently discovered that 298 baptistina does not share the same chemical signature as the source of the k pg impact 124 although this finding may make the link between the baptistina family and k pg impactor more difficult to substantiate it does not preclude the possibility 124 a 2011 wide-field infrared survey explorer wise study of reflected light from the asteroids of the family estimated the break-up at 80 ma giving it insufficient time to shift orbits and impact the earth by 66 ma 125 in a 2013 paper paul renne of the berkeley geochronology center reported that the date of the asteroid event is 7001660430000000000 66.043 0.011 million years ago based on argon argon dating he further posits that the mass extinction occurred within 32,000 years of this date 3 126 effects of impact edit in march 2010 an international panel of scientists endorsed the asteroid hypothesis specifically the chicxulub impact as being the cause of the extinction a team of 41 scientists reviewed 20 years of scientific literature and in so doing also ruled out other theories such as massive volcanism they had determined that a 10-to-15-kilometre 6.2 to 9.3 mi space rock hurtled into earth at chicxulub on mexico s yucat n peninsula the collision would have released the same energy as 100 teratonnes of tnt 420 zj more than a billion times the energy of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki 12 the consequences of the chicxulub impact were of global extent some of these phenomena were brief occurrences that immediately followed the impact but there were also long-term geochemical and climatic disruptions that were catastrophic to the ecology the reentry of ejecta into earth s atmosphere would include a brief hours long but intense pulse of infrared radiation killing exposed organisms 55 a paper in 2013 by a prominent modeler of nuclear winter suggested that the global debris layer deposited by the impact contains enough soot to hint that the entire terrestrial biosphere burned with an implication of this being that this would have caused a global soot-cloud blocking out the sun creating the nuclear winter effect 127 the suggestion that global firestorms occurred is debated however with opponents arguing that while ferocious fires probably did result locally ferocious fires do not necessarily equal firestorms and any such ferocious fires were instead limited to the immediate american continent this disagreement between researchers is termed the cretaceous-palaeogene firestorm debate aside from the hypothesized fire and or nuclear winter effects the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis by creating a dust cloud that blocked sunlight for up to a year 106 further the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock much of which was vaporized thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere which might have reduced sunlight reaching the earth s surface by more than 50 and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic 106 128 the acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate at brazos section the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7 c for decades after the impact 129 it would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton and of organisms dependent on them including predatory animals as well as herbivores some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival however 90 106 if widespread fires occurred they would have increased the co 2 content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary greenhouse effect once the dust clouds and aerosol settled and this would have exterminated the most vulnerable organisms that survived the period immediately after the impact 130 most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the earth at approximately the end of the cretaceous but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the extinctions 39 131 in a 2016 study a team from potsdam institute for climate impact research announced that the main cause for mass extinction was a severe drop in global temperatures caused by concentrations of large amount of droplets of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere freezing temperatures lasted for at least three years 132 for biosphere it was especially unfortunate that the asteroid hit some of the worst possible places with a large amount of combustible hydrocarbons and sulphur 133 the river bed at the moody creek mine 7 mile creek waimatuku dunollie new zealand contains evidence of a devastating event on terrestrial plant communities at the cretaceous-tertiary boundary confirming the severity and global nature of the event 58 2016 chicxulub crater drilling project edit in 2016 a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the chicxulub impact crater to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself the discoveries confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by immense heat and shocked by immense pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits it originates much deeper in the earth and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact that gypsum a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region had been almost entirely removed and must therefore have been almost entirely vaporized and entered the atmosphere and that the event was immediately followed by a huge megatsunami a massive movement of sea waters sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring these strongly support the hypothesis that the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring to melt shock and eject granite from within the earth to create colossal water movements and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere where they would have persisted for a long time this global dispersal of dust and sulfates would have led to a sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide large temperature drops and devastated the food chain all of which corroborated the impact s role in the extinction event 134 135 alternative hypotheses edit though the extinctions occurring at the same time as the chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of extinction some scientists continue to dispute the role of the chicxulub impact in driving the extinction and suggest that other events may have contributed to the end-cretaceous mass extinction in particular volcanic eruptions climate change sea level change and other impact events have been suggested to play a role in driving the k pg extinction deccan traps edit before 2000 arguments that the deccan traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 mya and lasted more than 2 million years the most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted over a period of 800,000 years spanning the k pg boundary and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter 136 the deccan traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants in addition deccan trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere 137 138 in the years when the deccan traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction luis alvarez who died in 1988 replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data while his assertion was not initially well-received later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim eventually most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive earth impact even walter alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on earth even before the impact however such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the indian deccan traps and these may have contributed to the extinctions 139 the duration of the k-t extinction event was less than 10 ky and the time span is too short to be explained by deccan volcanism 115 geophysical models and high-precision radiometric dating suggest that the chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest deccan eruptions and potentially could have triggered eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on earth 140 141 multiple impact event edit one other crater also appears to have been formed around the time of the k pg boundary other crater-like topographic features have also been proposed as impact craters formed in connection with cretaceous-paleogene extinction this suggests to some the possibility of near-simultaneous multiple impacts perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object similar to the shoemaker levy 9 impact with jupiter in addition to the 180 km 110 mi chicxulub crater there is the 24 km 15 mi boltysh crater in ukraine 7015205660879200000 65.17 0.64 ma the 20 km 12 mi silverpit crater in the north sea 7015187767720000000 59.5 14.5 ma possibly formed by bolide impact and the controversial and much larger 600 km 370 mi shiva crater any other craters that might have formed in the tethys ocean would have been obscured by tectonic events such as the northward drift of africa and india 142 143 144 145 maastrichtian sea-level regression edit there is clear evidence that sea levels fell in the final stage of the cretaceous by more than at any other time in the mesozoic era in some maastrichtian stage rock layers from various parts of the world the later layers are terrestrial earlier layers represent shorelines and the earliest layers represent seabeds these layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with mountain building therefore the likeliest explanation is a regression that is a drop in sea level there is no direct evidence for the cause of the regression but the explanation currently accepted as most likely is that the mid-ocean ridges became less active and therefore sank under their own weight 27 146 a severe regression would have greatly reduced the continental shelf area which is the most species-rich part of the sea and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction however research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction the regression would also have caused climate changes partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the earth s albedo and therefore increasing global temperatures 107 marine regression also resulted in the loss of epeiric seas such as the western interior seaway of north america the loss of these seas greatly altered habitats removing coastal plains that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the dinosaur park formation another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans while this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates those that prefer marine environments such as sharks suffered 89 multiple causes edit in a review article j david archibald and david e fastovsky discussed a scenario combining three major postulated causes volcanism marine regression and extraterrestrial impact in this scenario terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in and loss of habitats dinosaurs as the largest vertebrates were the first affected by environmental changes and their diversity declined at the same time particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe then an impact event occurred causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains the major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction 89 recent work at seymour island antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the cretaceous-paleogene boundary with one correlating to deccan trap volcanism and one correlated with the chicxulub impact 147 sierra peterson has recently published a combined extinction patterns as a result of a new clumped isotope temperature record from a hiatus-free expanded kpg boundary section from seymour island antarctica they documented a 7.8 3.3 c warming synchronous with the onset of deccan traps volcanism and a second smaller warming at the time of meteorite impact they suggest local warming may have been amplified due to simultaneous disappearance of continental or sea ice intra-shell variability indicates a possible reduction in seasonality after deccan eruptions began continuing through the meteorite event species extinction at seymour island occurred in two pulses that coincide with the two observed warming events directly linking the end-cretaceous extinction at this site to both volcanic and meteorite events via climate change 147 recovery and radiation edit the k pg extinction had a profound effect on the evolution of life on earth the elimination of dominant cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the paleogene 21 the most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals after the k pg extinction mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs also significant within the mammalian genera new species were approximately 9.1 larger after the k pg boundary 148 other groups also underwent major radiations based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating neoaves appeared to radiate after the k pg boundary 22 149 they even produced giant flightless forms such as the herbivorous gastornis and dromornithidae and the predatory phorusrhacidae the extinction of cretaceous lizards and snakes may have led to the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas monitor lizards and boas 15 on land giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared and in the seas giant sea snakes radiated teleost fish diversified explosively 23 filling the niches left vacant by the extinction groups appearing in the paleocene and eocene include billfish tunas eels and flatfish major changes are also seen in paleogene insect communities many groups of ants were present in the cretaceous but in the eocene ants became dominant and diverse with larger colonies butterflies diversified as well perhaps to take the place of leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction the advanced mound-building termites termitidae also appear to have risen in importance 150 see also edit climate across cretaceous
