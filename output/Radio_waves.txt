waves showing the electric field lines the antenna in the center is two vertical metal rods connected to a radio transmitter not shown the transmitter applies an alternating electric current to the rods which charges them alternately positive and negative loops of electric field leave the antenna and travel away at the speed of light these are the radio waves in this animation the action is shown slowed down enormously radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 ghz to as low as 3 khz though some definitions 1 2 describe waves above 300 mhz or 3 ghz as microwaves or include waves of any lower frequency at 300 ghz the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm 0.039 in and at 3 khz is 100 km 62 mi like all other electromagnetic waves they travel at the speed of light naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning or by astronomical objects artificially generated radio waves are used for fixed and mobile radio communication broadcasting radar and other navigation systems communications satellites computer networks and many other applications radio waves are generated by radio transmitters and received by radio receivers different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the earth s atmosphere long waves can diffract around obstacles like mountains and follow the contour of the earth ground waves shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and return to earth beyond the horizon skywaves while much shorter wavelengths bend or diffract very little and travel on a line of sight so their propagation distances are limited to the visual horizon to prevent interference between different users the artificial generation and use of radio waves is strictly regulated by law coordinated by an international body called the international telecommunications union itu which defines radio waves as electromagnetic waves of frequencies arbitrarily lower than 3 000 ghz propagated in space without artificial guide 3 the radio spectrum is divided into a number of radio bands on the basis of frequency allocated to different uses diagram of the electric fields e and magnetic fields h of radio waves emitted by a monopole radio transmitting antenna small dark vertical line in the center the

electromagnetic radiation including radio waves radio waves were first predicted by mathematical work done in 1867 by scottish mathematical physicist james clerk maxwell 4 maxwell noticed wavelike properties of light and similarities in electrical and magnetic observations his mathematical theory now called maxwell s equations described light waves and radio waves as waves of electromagnetism that travel in space radiated by a charged particle as it undergoes acceleration in 1887 heinrich hertz demonstrated the reality of maxwell s electromagnetic waves by experimentally generating radio waves in his laboratory 5 showing that they exhibited the same wave properties as light standing waves refraction diffraction and polarization radio waves originally called hertzian waves 6 were first used for communication in the mid 1890s by guglielmo marconi who developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers the modern term radio wave replaced the original name hertzian wave around 1912 propagation edit the study of radio propagation how radio waves move in free space and over the surface of the earth is vitally important in the design of practical radio systems radio waves passing through different environments experience reflection refraction polarization diffraction and absorption different frequencies experience different combinations of these phenomena in the earth s atmosphere making certain radio bands more useful for specific purposes than others practical radio systems mainly use three different techniques of radio propagation to communicate 7 line of sight this refers to radio waves that travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna it does not necessarily require a cleared sight path at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings foliage and other obstructions this is the only method of propagation possible at frequencies above 30 mhz on the surface of the earth line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about 64 km 40 mi this is the method used by cell phones fm and television broadcasting and radar by using dish antennas to transmit beams of microwaves point-to-point microwave relay links transmit telephone and television signals over long distances up to the visual horizon ground stations can communicate with satellites and spacecraft billions of miles from earth indirect propagation radio waves can reach points beyond the line-of-sight by diffraction and reflection 7 diffraction allows a radio wave to bend around obstructions such as a building edge a vehicle or a turn in a hall radio waves also reflect from surfaces such as walls floors ceilings vehicles and the ground these propagation methods occur in short range radio communication systems such as cell phones cordless phones walkie-talkies and wireless networks a drawback of this mode is multipath propagation in which radio waves travel from the transmitting to the receiving antenna via multiple paths the waves interfere often causing fading and other reception problems ground waves at lower frequencies below 2 mhz in the medium wave and longwave bands due to diffraction vertically polarized radio waves can bend over hills and mountains and propagate beyond the horizon traveling as surface waves which follow the contour of the earth this allows mediumwave and longwave broadcasting stations to have coverage areas beyond the horizon out to hundreds of miles as the frequency drops the losses decrease and the achievable range increases military very low frequency vlf and extremely low frequency elf communication systems can communicate over most of the earth and with submarines hundreds of feet underwater skywaves at medium wave and shortwave wavelengths radio waves reflect off conductive layers of charged particles ions in a part of the atmosphere called the ionosphere so radio waves directed at an angle into the sky can return to earth beyond the horizon this is called skip or skywave propagation by using multiple skips communication at intercontinental distances can be achieved skywave propagation is variable and dependent on atmospheric conditions it is most reliable at night and in the winter widely used during the first half of the 20th century due to its unreliability skywave communication has mostly been abandoned remaining uses are by military over-the-horizon oth radar systems by some automated systems by radio amateurs and by shortwave broadcasting stations to broadcast to other countries speed wavelength and frequency edit radio waves in vacuum travel at the speed of light 8 9 when passing through a material medium they are slowed according to that object s permeability and permittivity air is thin enough that in the earth s atmosphere radio waves travel very close to the speed of light the wavelength is the distance from one peak of the wave s electric field wave s peak crest to the next and is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave the distance a radio wave travels in one second in a vacuum is 299,792,458 meters 983,571,056 ft which is the wavelength of a 1 hertz radio signal a 1 megahertz radio signal has a wavelength of 299.8 meters 984 ft radio communication edit in radio communication systems information is carried across space using radio waves at the sending end the information to be sent in the form of a time-varying electrical signal is applied to a radio transmitter 10 the information signal can be an audio signal representing sound from a microphone a video signal representing moving images from a video camera or a digital signal representing data from a computer in the transmitter an electronic oscillator generates an alternating current oscillating at a radio frequency called the carrier because it serves to carry the information through the air the information signal is used to modulate the carrier altering some aspect of it piggybacking the information on the carrier the modulated carrier is amplified and applied to an antenna the oscillating current pushes the electrons in the antenna back and forth creating oscillating electric and magnetic fields which radiate the energy away from the antenna as radio waves the radio waves carry the information to the receiver location at the receiver the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna 10 this voltage is applied to the radio receiver which extracts the information signal the receiver first uses a bandpass filter to separate the desired radio station s radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna then amplifies the signal so it is stronger then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a demodulator the recovered signal is sent to a loudspeaker or earphone to produce sound or a television display screen to produce a visible image or other devices a digital data signal is applied to a computer or microprocessor which interacts with a human user the radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other they can be separated in the receiver because each transmitter s radio waves oscillate at a different rate in other words each transmitter has a different frequency measured in kilohertz khz megahertz mhz or gigahertz ghz the bandpass filter in the receiver consists of a tuned circuit which acts like a resonator similarly to a tuning fork 10 it has a natural resonant frequency at which it oscillates the resonant frequency is set equal to the frequency of the desired radio station the oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to oscillate in sympathy and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on biological and environmental effects edit radio waves are nonionizing radiation which means they do not have enough energy to separate electrons from atoms or molecules ionizing them or break chemical bonds causing chemical reactions or dna damage the main effect of absorption of radio waves by materials is to heat them similarly to the infrared waves radiated by sources of heat such as a space heater or wood fire the oscillating electric field of the wave causes polar molecules to vibrate back and forth increasing the temperature this is how a microwave oven cooks food however unlike infrared waves which are mainly absorbed at the surface of objects and cause surface heating radio waves are able to penetrate the surface and deposit their energy inside materials and biological tissues the depth to which radio waves penetrate decreases with their frequency and also depends on the material s resistivity and permittivity it is given by a parameter called the skin depth of the material which is the depth within which 63 of the energy is deposited for example the 2.45 ghz radio waves microwaves in a microwave oven penetrate most foods approximately 2.5 to 3.8 cm 1 to 1.5 inches radio waves have been applied to the body for 100 years in the medical therapy of diathermy for deep heating of body tissue to promote increased blood flow and healing more recently they have been used to create higher temperatures in hyperthermia treatment to kill cancer cells looking into a source of radio waves at close range such as the waveguide of a working radio transmitter can cause damage to the lens of the eye by heating a strong enough beam of radio waves can penetrate the eye and heat the lens enough to cause cataracts 11 12 13 14 15 since the heating effect is in principle no different from other sources of heat most research into possible health hazards of exposure to radio waves has focused on nonthermal effects whether radio waves have any effect on tissues besides that caused by heating electromagnetic radiation has been classified by the international agency for research on cancer iarc as possibly carcinogenic to humans 16 radio waves can be shielded against by a conductive metal sheet or screen an enclosure of sheet or screen is called a faraday cage a metal screen shields against radio waves as well as a solid sheet as long as the holes in the screen are smaller than about 1 20 of wavelength of the waves 17 see also edit look up radio wave in wiktionary the free dictionary radio astronomy television transmitter notes edit
