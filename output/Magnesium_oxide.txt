solid mineral that occurs naturally as periclase and is a source of magnesium see also oxide it has an empirical formula of mgo and consists of a lattice of mg2 ions and o2 ions held together by ionic bonding magnesium hydroxide forms in the presence of water mgo h2o mg oh 2 but it can be reversed by heating it to separate moisture magnesium oxide was historically known as magnesia alba literally the white mineral from magnesia other sources give magnesia alba as mgco3 to differentiate it from magnesia negra a black mineral containing what is now known as manganese while magnesium oxide normally refers to mgo magnesium peroxide mgo2 is also known as a compound according to evolutionary crystal structure prediction 8 mgo2 is thermodynamically stable at pressures above 116 gpa gigapascals and a semiconducting suboxide mg3o2 is thermodynamically stable above 500 gpa because of its stability mgo is used as a model system for investigating vibrational properties of crystals 9 contents 1 production 2 applications 2.1 niche uses 2.2 medical 2.3 other 3 precautions 4 see also 5 references 6 external links production edit magnesium oxide is produced by the calcination of magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide the latter is obtained by the treatment of magnesium chloride solutions typically seawater with lime 10 mg 2 ca oh 2 mg oh 2 ca 2 calcining at different temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity high temperatures 1500 2000 c diminish the available surface area and produces dead-burned often called dead burnt magnesia an unreactive form used as a refractory calcining temperatures 1000 1500 c produce hard-burned magnesia which has limited reactivity and calcining at lower temperature 700 1000 c produces light-burned magnesia a reactive form also known as caustic calcined magnesia although some decomposition of the carbonate to oxide occurs at temperatures below 700 c the resulting materials appears to reabsorb carbon dioxide from the air 11 applications edit mgo is prized as a refractory material i e a solid that is physically and chemically stable at high temperatures it has two useful attributes high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity by far the largest consumer of magnesia worldwide is the refractory industry which consumed about 56 of the magnesia in the united states in 2004 the remaining 44 being used in agricultural chemical construction environmental and other industrial applications 12 mgo is used as a basic refractory material for crucibles it is a principal fireproofing ingredient in construction materials as a construction material magnesium oxide wallboards have several attractive characteristics fire resistance termite resistance moisture resistance mold and mildew resistance and strength citation needed niche uses edit mgo is one of the components in portland cement in dry process plants magnesium oxide is used extensively in the soil and groundwater remediation wastewater treatment drinking water treatment air emissions treatment and waste treatment industries for its acid buffering capacity and related effectiveness in stabilizing dissolved heavy metal species according to whom many heavy metals species such as lead and cadmium are most soluble in water at acidic ph below 6 as well as high ph above 11 solubility of metals affects bioavailability of the species and mobility soil and groundwater systems most metal species are toxic to humans at certain concentrations therefore it is imperative to minimize metal bioavailability and mobility granular mgo is often blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material which is also commonly of a low acidic ph in order to drive the ph into the 8 10 range where most metals are at their lowest solubilities metal-hydroxide complexes have a tendency to precipitate out of aqueous solution in the ph range of 8 10 mgo is widely regarded as the most effective metals stabilization compound when compared to portland cement lime kiln dust products power generation waste products and various proprietary products due to mgo s superior buffering capacity cost effectiveness and ease safety of handling most if not all products that are marketed as metals stabilization technologies create very high ph conditions in aquifers whereas mgo creates an ideal aquifer condition with a ph of 8 10 additionally magnesium an essential element to most biological systems is provided to soil and groundwater microbial populations during mgo-assisted metals remediation as an added benefit medical edit magnesium oxide has poor solubility in water and is poorly absorbed from the gut for this reason magnesium oxide is relatively ineffective for correcting magnesium deficiency magnesium oxide is used for relief of heartburn and sour stomach as an antacid magnesium supplement and as a short-term laxative it is also used to improve symptoms of indigestion side effects of magnesium oxide may include nausea and cramping 13 in quantities sufficient to obtain a laxative effect side effects of long-term use include enteroliths resulting in bowel obstruction 14 other edit it is used as a reference white color in colorimetry owing to its good diffusing and reflectivity properties 15 it may be smoked onto the surface of an opaque material to form an integrating sphere it is used extensively as an electrical insulator in tubular construction heating elements there are several mesh sizes available and most commonly used ones are 40 and 80 mesh per the american foundry society the extensive use is due to its high dielectric strength and average thermal conductivity mgo is usually crushed and compacted with minimal airgaps or voids the electrical heating industry also experimented with aluminium oxide but it is not used anymore it is also used as an insulator in heat-resistant electrical cable mgo doping has been shown to effectively inhibit grain growth in ceramics and improve their fracture toughness by transforming the mechanism of crack growth at nanoscale 16 unpolished mgo crystal pressed mgo is used as an optical material it is transparent from 0.3 to 7 m the refractive index is 1.72 at 1 m and the abbe number is 53.58 it is sometimes known by the eastman kodak trademarked name irtran-5 although this designation is obsolete crystalline pure mgo is available commercially and has a small use in infrared optics 17 mgo is packed around transuranic waste at the waste isolation pilot plant to control the solubility of radionuclides 18 mgo has an important place as a commercial plant fertilizer 19 and as animal feed 20 an aerosolized solution of mgo is used in library science and collections management for the deacidification of at-risk paper items in this process the alkalinity of mgo and similar compounds neutralizes the relatively high acidity characteristic of low-quality paper thus slowing the rate of deterioration 21 mgo is also used as a protective coating in plasma displays magnesium oxide is used as an oxide barrier in spin-tunneling devices owing to the crystalline structure of its thin films which can be deposited by magnetron sputtering for example it shows characteristics superior to those of the commonly used amorphous al2o3 in particular spin polarization of about 85 has been achieved with mgo 22 versus 40 60 with aluminium oxide 23 the value of tunnel magnetoresistance is also significantly higher for mgo 600 at room temperature and 1,100 at 4.2 k 24 than al2o3 ca 70 at room temperature 25 mgo is thermally stable up to about 700 k vs 600 k for al2o3 precautions edit inhalation of magnesium oxide fumes can cause metal fume fever 26 see also edit calcium oxide barium oxide magnesium sulfide
