https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust continental crust from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the thickness of earth s crust km the continental crust is the layer of igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that forms the continents and the areas of shallow seabed close to their shores known as continental shelves this layer is sometimes called sial because its bulk composition is more felsic compared to the oceanic crust called sima which has a more mafic bulk composition changes in seismic wave velocities have shown that at a certain depth the conrad discontinuity there is a reasonably sharp contrast between the more felsic upper continental crust and the lower continental crust which is more mafic in character the continental crust consists of various layers with a bulk composition that is intermediate to felsic the average density of continental crust is about 2.7 g cm3 less dense than the ultramafic material that makes up the mantle which has a density of around 3.3 g cm3 continental crust is also less dense than oceanic crust whose density is about 2.9 g cm3 at 25 to 70 km continental crust is considerably thicker than oceanic crust which has an average thickness of around 7 10 km about 40 of earth s surface is currently occupied by continental crust 1 it makes up about 70 of the volume of earth s crust 2 contents 1 importance 2 origin 3 forces at work 4 see also 5 references 6 bibliography 7 external links importance edit because the surface of continental crust mainly lies above sea level its existence allowed land life to evolve from marine life its existence also provides broad expanses of shallow water known as epeiric seas and continental shelves where complex metazoan life could become established during early paleozoic time in what is now called the cambrian explosion 3 origin edit all continental crust ultimately derives from the fractional differentiation of oceanic crust over many milions of years 4 this process has been and continues today primarily as a result of the volcanism associated with subduction there is little evidence of continental crust prior to 3.5 ga 4 about 20 of the continental crust s current volume was formed by 3.0 ga 5 there was relatively rapid development on shield areas consisting of continental crust between 3.0 and 2.5 ga 4 during this time interval about 60 of the continental crust s current volume was formed 5 the remaining 20 has formed during the last 2.5 ga forces at work edit in contrast to the persistence of continental crust the size shape and number of continents are constantly changing through geologic time different tracts rift apart collide and recoalesce as part of a grand supercontinent cycle 6 there are currently about 7 billion cubic kilometers of continental crust but this quantity varies because of the nature of the forces involved the relative permanence of continental crust contrasts with the short life of oceanic crust because continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust when active margins of the two meet in subduction zones the oceanic crust is typically subducted back into the mantle continental crust is rarely subducted this may occur where continental crustal blocks collide and overthicken causing deep melting under mountain belts such as the himalayas or the alps for this reason the oldest rocks on earth are within the cratons or cores of the continents rather than in repeatedly recycled oceanic crust the oldest intact crustal fragment is the acasta gneiss at 4.01 ga whereas the oldest oceanic crust located on the pacific plate offshore of kamchatka is from the jurassic 180 ma continental crust and the rock layers that lie on and within it are thus the best archive of earth s history 1 7 the height of mountain ranges is usually related to the thickness of crust this results from the isostasy associated with orogeny mountain formation the crust is thickened by the compressive forces related to subduction or continental collision the buoyancy of the crust forces it upwards the forces of the collisional stress balanced by gravity and erosion this forms a keel or mountain root beneath the mountain range which is where the thickest crust is found 8 the thinnest continental crust is found in rift zones where the crust is thinned by detachment faulting and eventually severed replaced by oceanic crust the edges of continental fragments formed this way both sides of the atlantic ocean for example are termed passive margins the high temperatures and pressures at depth often combined with a long history of complex distortion cause much of the lower continental crust to be metamorphic - the main exception to this being recent igneous intrusions igneous rock may also be underplated to the underside of the crust i e adding to the crust by forming a layer immediately beneath it continental crust is produced and far less often destroyed mostly by plate tectonic processes especially at convergent plate boundaries additionally continental crustal material is transferred to oceanic crust by sedimentation new material can be added to the continents by the partial melting of oceanic crust at subduction zones causing the lighter material to rise as magma forming volcanoes also material can be accreted horizontally when volcanic island arcs seamounts or similar structures collide with the side of the continent as a result of plate tectonic movements continental crust is also lost through erosion and sediment subduction tectonic erosion of forearcs delamination and deep subduction of continental crust in collision zones 9 many theories of crustal growth are controversial including rates of crustal growth and recycling whether the lower crust is recycled differently from the upper crust and over how much of earth history plate tectonics has operated and so could be the dominant mode of continental crust formation and destruction 10 it is a matter of debate whether the amount of continental crust has been increasing decreasing or remaining constant over geological time one model indicates that at prior to 3.7 ga ago continental crust constituted less than 10 of the present amount 11 by 3.0 ga ago the amount was about 25 and following a period of rapid crustal evolution it was about 60 of the current amount by 2.6 ga ago 12 the growth of continental crust appears to have occurred in spurts of increased activity corresponding to five episodes of increased production through geologic time 13 see also edit terrane geologic province lithosphere references edit a b cogley 1984 hawkesworth et al 2010 ben waggoner allen collins university of california museum of paleontology retrieved 30 november 2013 a b c hart p j earth s crust and upper mantle american geophysical union 1969 pp 13-15 isbn 978-0-87590-013-1 a b mccann t editor 2008 the geology of central europe volume 1 precambrian and palaeozoic london the geological society p 22 isbn 978-1-86239-245-8 cs1 maint extra text authors list link condie 2002 bowring williams 1999 saal et al 1998 clift vannuchi 2004 armstrong 1991 von huene scholl 1991 taylor mclennan 1995 butler 2011 see graphic bibliography edit armstrong r l 1991 pdf australian journal of earth sciences 38 613 630 bibcode doi bowring s a williams i s 1999 priscoan 4.00-4.03 ga orthogneisses from northwestern canada contributions to mineralogy and petrology 134 3 16 bibcode doi butler rob 2011 retrieved 29 january 2006 cogley j graham 1984 continental margins and the extent and number of continents reviews of geophysics 22 2 101 122 bibcode doi condie kent c 2002 the supercontinent cycle are there two patterns of cyclicity journal of african earth sciences 35 2 179 183 bibcode doi clift p vannuchi p 2004 controls on tectonic accretion versus erosion in subduction zones implications for the origin and recycling of the continental crust reviews of geophysics 42 rg2001 bibcode doi hawkesworth c j dhuime b pietranik a b cawood p a kemp a i s storey c d 2010 the generation and evolution of the continental crust journal of the geological society london 167 229 248 doi saal a l rudnick r l ravizza g e hart s r 1998 re os isotope evidence for the composition formation and age of the lower continental crust nature 393 6680 58 61 bibcode doi walther john victor 2005 jones bartlett p 35 isbn 0-7637-2642-7 diagram entitled model of growth of continental crust through time by taylor s r mclennan s m 1995 the geochemical evolution of the continental crust rev geophys 33 241 265 bibcode doi von huene roland scholl david w 1991 observations at convergent margins concerning sediment subduction subduction erosion and the growth of continental crust reviews of geophysics 29 279 316 bibcode doi external links edit retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title continental crust oldid 828789113 categories plate tectonics structure of the earth hidden categories cs1 maint extra text authors list use dmy dates from july 2013 navigation menu search this page was last edited on 4 march 2018 at 19 39 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
