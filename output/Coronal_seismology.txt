corona with the use of magnetohydrodynamic mhd waves and oscillations magnetohydrodynamics studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids - in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma observed properties of the waves e g period wavelength amplitude temporal and spatial signatures what is the shape of the wave perturbation characteristic scenarios of the wave evolution is the wave damped combined with a theoretical modelling of the wave phenomena dispersion relations evolutionary equations etc may reflect physical parameters of the corona which are not accessible in situ such as the coronal magnetic field strength and alfv n velocity 1 and coronal dissipative coefficients 2 originally the method of mhd coronal seismology was suggested by y uchida in 1970 3 for propagating waves and b roberts et al in 1984 4 for standing waves but was not practically applied until the late 90s due to a lack of necessary observational resolution philosophically coronal seismology is similar to the earth s seismology helioseismology and mhd spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices in all these approaches waves of various kind are used to probe a medium the theoretical foundation of coronal seismology is the dispersion relation of mhd modes of a plasma cylinder a plasma structure which is nonuniform in the transverse direction and extended along the magnetic field this model works well for the description of a number of plasma structures observed in the solar corona e g coronal loops prominence fibrils plumes various filaments such a structure acts as a waveguide of mhd waves this discussion is adapted from nakariakov verwichte 2009 5 contents 1 types of magnetohydrodynamic waves 2 observations 3 conclusions 4 references 5 external links types of magnetohydrodynamic waves edit there are several distinct kinds of mhd modes which have quite different dispersive polarisation and propagation properties kink or transverse modes which are oblique fast magnetoacoustic also known as magnetosonic waves guided by the plasma structure the mode causes the displacement of the axis of the plasma structure these modes are weakly compressible but could nevertheless be observed with imaging instruments as periodic standing or propagating displacements of coronal structures e g coronal loops the frequency of transverse or kink modes is given by the following expression k 2 k z b 2 i e displaystyle omega k sqrt frac 2k z b 2 mu rho i rho e for kink modes the parameter the azimuthal wave number in a cylindrical model of a loop m displaystyle m is equal to 1 meaning that the cylinder is swaying with fixed ends sausage modes which are also oblique fast magnetoacoustic waves guided by the plasma structure the mode causes expansions and contractions of the plasma structure but does not displace its axis these modes are compressible and cause significant variation of the absolute value of the magnetic field in the oscillating structure the frequency of sausage modes is given by the following expression s k z 2 b 2 e displaystyle omega s sqrt frac k z 2 b 2 mu rho e for sausage modes the parameter m displaystyle m is equal to 0 this would be interpreted as a breathing in and out again with fixed endpoints longitudinal or slow or acoustic modes which are slow magnetoacoustic waves propagating mainly along the magnetic field in the plasma structure these mode are essentially compressible the magnetic field perturbation in these modes is negligible the frequency of slow modes is given by the following expression l k z 2 c s 2 c a 2 c s 2 c a 2 displaystyle omega l sqrt k z 2 left frac c s 2 c a 2 c s 2 c a 2 right where we define c s displaystyle c s as the sound speed and c a displaystyle c a as the alfv n velocity torsional alfv n or twist modes are incompressible transverse perturbations of the magnetic field along certain individual magnetic surfaces in contrast with kink modes torsional modes cannot be observed with imaging instruments as they do not cause the displacement of either the structure axis or its boundary a k z 2 b 2 i displaystyle omega a sqrt frac k z 2 b 2 mu rho i observations edit trace image of a

to send a spacecraft as close as 9 solar radii from the sun parker solar probe is planned for launch in 2015 and aims to provide in-situ measurements of the solar magnetic field solar wind and corona it should include a magnetometer and plasma wave sensor allowing unprecedented observations for coronal seismology conclusions edit the potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal magnetic field density scale height fine structure by which is meant the variation in structure of an inhomogeneous structure such as an inhomogeneous coronal loop and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups work relating to the coronal magnetic field was mentioned earlier 1 it has been shown that sufficiently broadband slow magnetoacoustic waves consistent with currently available observations in the low frequency part of the spectrum could provide the rate of heat deposition sufficient to heat a coronal loop 6 regarding the density scale height transverse oscillations of coronal loops that have both variable circular cross-sectional area and plasma density in the longitudinal direction have been studied theoretically a second order ordinary differential equation has been derived describing the displacement of the loop axis together with boundary conditions solving this equation determines the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes the coronal density scale height could then be estimated by using the observed ratio of the fundamental frequency and first overtone of loop kink oscillations 7 little is known of coronal fine structure doppler shift oscillations in hot active region loops obtained with the solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation instrument sumer aboard soho have been studied the spectra were recorded along a 300 arcsec slit placed at a fixed position in the corona above the active regions some oscillations showed phase propagation along the slit in one or both directions with apparent speeds in the range of 8 102 km per second together with distinctly different intensity and line width distributions along the slit these features can be explained by the excitation of the oscillation at a footpoint of an
