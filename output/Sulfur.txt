nonmetallic under normal conditions sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with a chemical formula s8 elemental sulfur is a bright yellow crystalline solid at room temperature chemically sulfur reacts with all elements except for gold platinum iridium tellurium and the noble gases sulfur is the tenth most common element by mass in the universe and the fifth most common in the earth though sometimes found in pure native form sulfur on earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals being abundant in native form sulfur was known in ancient times being mentioned for its uses in ancient india ancient greece china and egypt in the bible sulfur is called brimstone 5 today almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum the greatest commercial use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers and other chemical processes the element sulfur is used in matches insecticides and fungicides many sulfur compounds are odoriferous and the smells of odorized natural gas skunk scent grapefruit and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds hydrogen sulfide

that is best observed in the dark physical properties edit sulfur forms polyatomic molecules with different chemical formulas the best-known allotrope being octasulfur cyclo-s8 the point group of cyclo-s8 is d4d and its dipole moment is 0 d 6 octasulfur is a soft bright-yellow solid that is odorless but impure samples have an odor similar to that of matches 7 it melts at 115.21 c 239.38 f boils at 444.6 c 832.3 f and sublimes easily 5 at 95.2 c 203.4 f below its melting temperature cyclo-octasulfur changes from -octasulfur to the -polymorph 8 the structure of the s8 ring is virtually unchanged by this phase change which affects the intermolecular interactions between its melting and boiling temperatures octasulfur changes its allotrope again turning from -octasulfur to -sulfur again accompanied by a lower density but increased viscosity due to the formation of polymers 8 at higher temperatures the viscosity decreases as depolymerization occurs molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above 200 c 392 f the density of sulfur is about 2 g cm 3 depending on the allotrope all of the stable allotropes are excellent electrical insulators chemical properties edit sulfur burns with a blue flame with formation of sulfur dioxide which has a suffocating and irritating odor sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and to a lesser extent in other nonpolar organic solvents such as benzene and toluene the first and second ionization energies of sulfur are 999.6 and 2252 kj mol 1 respectively despite such figures the 2 oxidation state is rare with 4 and 6 being more common the fourth and sixth ionization energies are 4556 and 8495.8 kj mol 1 the magnitude of the figures caused by electron transfer between orbitals these states are only stable with strong oxidants such as fluorine oxygen and chlorine citation needed sulfur reacts with nearly all other elements with the exception of gold platinum iridium nitrogen tellurium iodine and the noble gases some of those reactions need elevated temperatures 9 allotropes edit the structure of the cyclooctasulfur molecule s 8 sulfur forms over 30 solid allotropes more than any other element 10 besides s8 several other rings are known 11 removing one atom from the crown gives s7 which is more deeply yellow than s8 hplc analysis of elemental sulfur reveals an equilibrium mixture of mainly s8 but with s7 and small amounts of s6 12 larger rings have been prepared including s12 and s18 13 14 amorphous or plastic sulfur is produced by rapid cooling of molten sulfur for example by pouring it into cold water x-ray crystallography studies show that the amorphous form may have a helical structure with eight atoms per turn the long coiled polymeric molecules make the brownish substance elastic and in bulk this form has the feel of crude rubber this form is metastable at room temperature and gradually reverts to crystalline molecular allotrope which is no longer elastic this process happens within a matter of hours to days but can be rapidly catalyzed isotopes edit sulfur has 25 known isotopes four of which are stable 32s 94.99 0.26 33s 0.75 0.02 34s 4.25 0.24 and 36s 0.01 0.01

isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the s-34 values of co-genetic minerals the differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration the c-13 and s-34 of coexisting carbonate minerals and sulfides can be used to determine the ph and oxygen fugacity of the ore-bearing fluid during ore formation in most forest ecosystems sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere weathering of ore minerals and evaporites contribute some sulfur sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in hydrologic studies differences in the natural abundances can be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the 34s of

common element in the universe sulfur usually as sulfide is present in many types of meteorites ordinary chondrites contain on average 2.1 sulfur and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 6.6 it is normally present as troilite fes but there are exceptions with carbonaceous chondrites containing free sulfur sulfates and other sulfur compounds 18 the distinctive colors of jupiter s volcanic moon io are attributed to various forms of molten solid and gaseous sulfur 19 sulfur occurs in fumaroles such as this one in vulcano italy it is the fifth most common element by mass in the earth

below in the most common type of industrial curing or hardening and strengthening of natural rubber elemental sulfur is heated with the rubber to the point that chemical reactions form disulfide bridges between isoprene units of the polymer this process patented in 1843 made rubber a major industrial product especially in automobile tires because of the heat and sulfur the process was named vulcanization after the roman god of the forge and volcanism history edit antiquity edit pharmaceutical container for sulfur from the first half of the 20th century from the museo del objeto del objeto collection being abundantly available in native form sulfur was known in ancient times and is referred to in the torah genesis english translations of the bible commonly referred to burning sulfur as brimstone giving rise to the term fire-and-brimstone sermons in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that await the unbelieving and unrepentant it is from this part of the bible that hell is implied to smell of sulfur likely due to its association with volcanic activity according to the ebers papyrus a sulfur ointment was used in ancient egypt to treat granular eyelids sulfur was used for fumigation in preclassical greece 36 this is mentioned in the odyssey 37 pliny the elder discusses sulfur in book 35 of his natural history saying that its best-known source is the island of melos he mentions its use for fumigation medicine and bleaching cloth 38 a natural form of sulfur known as shiliuhuang was known in china since the 6th century bc and found in hanzhong 39 by the 3rd century the chinese discovered that sulfur could be extracted from pyrite 39 chinese daoists were interested in sulfur s flammability and its reactivity with certain metals yet its earliest practical uses were found in traditional chinese medicine 39 a song dynasty military treatise of 1044 ad described different formulas for chinese black powder which is a mixture of potassium nitrate kno 3 charcoal and sulfur it remains an ingredient of black gunpowder indian alchemists practitioners of the science of mercury sanskrit rasa stra wrote extensively about the use of sulfur in alchemical operations with mercury from the eighth century ad onwards 40 in the rasa stra tradition sulfur is called the smelly sanskrit gandhaka citation needed various alchemical symbols for sulfur early european alchemists gave sulfur a unique alchemical symbol a triangle at the top of a cross in traditional skin treatment elemental sulfur was used mainly in creams to alleviate such conditions as scabies ringworm psoriasis eczema and acne the mechanism of action is unknown though elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid which is through the action of sulfite a mild reducing and antibacterial agent 41 42 43 modern times edit sicilian kiln used to obtain sulfur from volcanic rock in 1777 antoine lavoisier helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element not a compound sulfur deposits in sicily were the dominant source for more than a century by the late 18th century about 2,000 tonnes per year of sulfur were imported into marseilles france for the production of sulfuric acid for use in the leblanc process in industrializing britain with the repeal of tariffs on salt in 1824 demand for sulfur from sicily surged upward the increasing british control and exploitation of the mining refining and transportation of the sulfur coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform sicily s backward and impoverished economy led to the sulfur crisis of 1840 when king ferdinand ii gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a french firm violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with britain a peaceful solution was eventually negotiated by france 44 45 in 1867 elemental sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in louisiana and texas the highly successful frasch process was developed to extract this resource 46 in the late 18th century furniture makers used molten sulfur to produce decorative inlays in their craft because of the sulfur dioxide produced during the process of melting sulfur the craft of sulfur inlays was soon abandoned molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor-mounted equipment attachment points pure powdered sulfur was used as a medicinal tonic and laxative 24 with the advent of the contact process the majority of sulfur today is used to make sulfuric acid for a wide range of uses particularly fertilizer 47 spelling and etymology edit sulfur is derived from the latin word sulpur which was hellenized to sulphur the spelling sulfur appears toward the end of the classical period the true greek word for sulfur is the source of the international chemical prefix thio- in 12th-century anglo-french it was sulfre in the 14th century the latin -ph- was restored for sulphre and by the 15th century the full latin spelling was restored for sulfur sulphur the parallel f ph spellings continued in britain until the 19th century when the word was standardized as sulphur 48 sulfur was the form chosen in the united states whereas canada uses both the iupac adopted the spelling sulfur in 1990 as did the nomenclature committee of the royal society of chemistry in 1992 restoring the spelling sulfur to britain 49 oxford dictionaries note that in chemistry and other technical uses the -f- spelling is now the standard form for this and related words in british as well as us contexts and is increasingly used in general contexts as well 50 production edit traditional sulfur mining at ijen volcano east java indonesia this image shows the dangerous and rugged conditions the miners face including toxic smoke and high drops as well as their lack of protective equipment the pipes over which they are standing are for condensing sulfur vapors sulfur may be found by itself and historically was usually obtained in this form pyrite has also been a source of sulfur 51 in volcanic regions in sicily in ancient times it was found on the surface of the earth and the sicilian process was used sulfur deposits were piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides with airspaces between them then some sulfur was pulverized spread over the stacked ore and ignited causing the free sulfur to melt down the hills eventually the surface-borne deposits played out and miners excavated veins that ultimately dotted the sicilian landscape with labyrinthine mines mining was unmechanized and labor-intensive with pickmen freeing the ore from the rock and mine-boys or carusi carrying baskets of ore to the surface often through a mile or more of tunnels once the ore was at the surface it was reduced and extracted in smelting ovens the conditions in sicilian sulfur mines were horrific prompting booker t washington to write i am not prepared just now to say to what extent i believe in a physical hell in the next world but a sulphur mine in sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that i expect to see in this life 52 elemental sulfur was extracted from salt domes in which it sometimes occurs in nearly pure form until the late 20th century sulfur is now produced as a side product of other industrial processes such as in oil refining in which sulfur is undesired as a mineral native sulfur under salt domes is thought to be a fossil mineral resource produced by the action of ancient bacteria on sulfate deposits it was removed from such salt-dome mines mainly by the frasch process 24 in this method superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur and then compressed air returned the 99.5 pure melted product to the surface throughout the 20th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur that required no further purification due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working them this process for mining sulfur has not been employed in a major way anywhere in the world since 2002 53 54 sulfur recovered from hydrocarbons in alberta stockpiled for shipment in north vancouver british columbia today sulfur is produced from petroleum natural gas and related fossil resources from which it is obtained mainly as hydrogen sulfide organosulfur compounds undesirable impurities in petroleum may be upgraded by subjecting them to hydrodesulfurization which cleaves the c s bonds 53 54 r-s-r 2 h 2 2 rh h 2s the resulting hydrogen sulfide from this process and also as it occurs in natural gas is converted into elemental sulfur by the claus process this process entails oxidation of some hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide and then the comproportionation of the two 53 54 3 o 2 2 h

from surface deposits in poorer nations with volcanoes such as indonesia and worker conditions have not improved much since booker t washington s days 57 the world production of sulfur in 2011 amounted to 69 million tonnes mt with more than 15 countries contributing more than 1 mt each countries producing more than 5 mt are china 9.6 us 8.8 canada 7.1 and russia 7.1 58 production has been

wastewater processing and mineral extraction 24 other important sulfur chemistry edit sulfur reacts directly with methane to give carbon disulfide used to manufacture cellophane and rayon 24 one of the direct uses of sulfur is in vulcanization of rubber where polysulfide chains crosslink organic polymers large quantities of sulfites are used to bleach paper and to preserve dried fruit many surfactants and detergents e g sodium lauryl sulfate are sulfate derivatives calcium sulfate gypsum caso4 2h2o is mined on the scale of 100 million tonnes each year for use in portland cement and fertilizers when silver-based photography was widespread sodium and ammonium thiosulfate were widely used as fixing agents sulfur is a component of gunpowder black powder fertilizer edit sulfur is increasingly used as a component of fertilizers the most important form of sulfur for fertilizer is the mineral calcium sulfate elemental sulfur is hydrophobic not soluble in water and cannot be used directly by plants over time soil bacteria can convert it to soluble derivatives which can then be used by plants sulfur improves the efficiency of other essential plant nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus 60 biologically produced sulfur particles are naturally hydrophilic due to a biopolymer coating and are easier to disperse over the land in a spray of diluted slurry resulting in a faster uptake the botanical requirement for sulfur equals or exceeds the requirement for phosphorus it is an essential nutrient for plant growth root nodule formation of legumes and immunity and defense systems sulfur deficiency has become widespread in many countries in europe 61 62 63 because atmospheric inputs of sulfur continue to decrease the deficit in the sulfur input output is likely to increase unless sulfur fertilizers are used fine chemicals edit a molecular model of the pesticide malathion organosulfur compounds are used in pharmaceuticals dyestuffs and agrochemicals many

a dip for pets to destroy ringworm fungus mange and other dermatoses and parasites sulfur candles of almost pure sulfur were burned to fumigate structures and wine barrels but are now considered too toxic for residences bactericide in winemaking and food preservation edit small amounts of sulfur dioxide gas addition or equivalent potassium metabisulfite addition to fermented wine to produce traces of sulfurous acid produced when so2 reacts with water and its sulfite salts in the mixture has been called the most powerful tool in winemaking 66 after the yeast-fermentation stage in winemaking sulfites absorb oxygen and inhibit aerobic bacterial growth that otherwise would turn ethanol into acetic acid souring the wine without this preservative step indefinite refrigeration of the product before consumption is usually required similar methods go back into antiquity but modern historical mentions of the practice go to the fifteenth century the practice is used by large

poured in and then scraped away so it is flush sulfur inlays were particularly popular in the late 18th and early 19th centuries notably amongst pennsylvania german cabinetmakers the practice soon died out as less toxic and flammable substances were substituted however some modern craftsmen have occasionally revived the technique in the creation of replica pieces 71 72 biological role edit protein and organic cofactors edit sulfur is an essential component of all living cells it is the seventh or eighth most abundant element in the human body by weight about equal in abundance to potassium and slightly greater than sodium and chlorine a 70 kg 150 lb human body contains about 140 grams of sulfur in plants and animals the amino acids cysteine and methionine contain most of the sulfur and the element is present in all polypeptides proteins and enzymes that contain these amino acids in humans methionine is an essential amino acid that must be ingested however save for the vitamins biotin and thiamine cysteine and all sulfur-containing compounds in the human body can be synthesized from methionine the enzyme sulfite oxidase is needed for the metabolism of methionine and cysteine in humans and animals disulfide bonds s-s bonds between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure these covalent bonds between peptide chains confer extra toughness and rigidity 73 for example the high strength of feathers and hair is due in part to the high content of s-s bonds with cysteine and sulfur eggs are high in sulfur to nourish feather formation in chicks and the characteristic odor of rotting eggs is due to hydrogen sulfide the high disulfide bond content of hair and feathers contributes to their indigestibility and to their characteristic disagreeable odor when burned homocysteine and taurine are other sulfur-containing acids that are similar in structure but not coded by dna and are not part of the primary structure of proteins many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with -sh moieties to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals two common examples from basic metabolism are coenzyme a and alpha-lipoic acid 73 two of the 13 classical vitamins biotin and thiamine contain sulfur with the latter being named for its sulfur content in intracellular chemistry sulfur operates as a carrier of reducing hydrogen and its electrons for cellular repair of oxidation reduced glutathione a sulfur-containing tripeptide is a reducing agent through its sulfhydryl -sh moiety derived from cysteine the thioredoxins a class of small proteins essential to all known life use neighboring pairs of reduced cysteines to work as general protein reducing agents with similar effect methanogenesis the route to most of the world s methane is a multistep biochemical transformation of carbon dioxide this conversion requires several organosulfur cofactors these include coenzyme m ch3sch2ch2so3 the immediate precursor to methane 74 metalloproteins and inorganic cofactors edit inorganic sulfur forms a part of iron sulfur clusters as well as many copper nickel and iron proteins most pervasive are the ferrodoxins which serve as electron shuttles in cells in bacteria the important nitrogenase enzymes contains an fe mo s cluster and is a catalyst that performs the important function of nitrogen fixation converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia that can be used by microorganisms and plants to make proteins dna rna alkaloids and the other organic nitrogen compounds necessary for life 75 sulfur metabolism and the sulfur cycle edit the sulfur cycle was the first of the biogeochemical cycles to be discovered in the 1880s while studying beggiatoa a bacterium living in a sulfur rich environment sergei winogradsky found that it oxidized hydrogen sulfide h2s as an energy source forming intracellular sulfur droplets winogradsky referred to this form of metabolism as inorgoxidation oxidation of inorganic compounds he continued to study it together with selman waksman until the 1950s sulfur oxidizers can use as energy sources reduced sulfur compounds including hydrogen sulfide elemental sulfur sulfite thiosulfate and various polythionates e g tetrathionate 76 they depend on enzymes such as sulfur oxygenase and sulfite oxidase to oxidize sulfur to sulfate some lithotrophs can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars a process known as chemosynthesis some bacteria and archaea use hydrogen sulfide in place of water as the electron donor in chemosynthesis a process similar to photosynthesis that produces sugars and utilizes oxygen as the electron acceptor the photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria and some lithotrophs use elemental oxygen to carry out such oxidization of hydrogen sulfide to produce elemental sulfur s0 oxidation state 0 primitive bacteria that live around deep ocean volcanic vents oxidize hydrogen sulfide in this way with oxygen the giant tube worm is an example of a large organism that uses hydrogen sulfide via bacteria as food to be oxidized the so-called sulfate-reducing bacteria by contrast breathe sulfate instead of oxygen they use organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as the energy source they use sulfur as the electron acceptor and reduce various oxidized sulfur compounds back into sulfide often into hydrogen sulfide they can grow on other partially oxidized sulfur compounds e g thiosulfates thionates polysulfides sulfites the hydrogen sulfide produced by these bacteria is responsible for some of the smell of intestinal gases flatus and decomposition products sulfur is absorbed by plants roots from soil as sulfate and transported as a phosphate ester sulfate is reduced to sulfide via sulfite before it is incorporated into cysteine and other organosulfur compounds 77 so 4 2 so 3 2 h 2s cysteine methionine precautions edit this

of the soluble sulfate salts such as epsom salts soluble sulfate salts are poorly absorbed and laxative when injected parenterally they are freely filtered by the kidneys and eliminated with very little toxicity in multi-gram amounts when sulfur burns in air it produces sulfur dioxide in water this gas produces sulfurous acid and sulfites sulfites are antioxidants that inhibit growth of aerobic bacteria and a useful food additive in small amounts at high concentrations these acids harm the lungs eyes or other tissues in organisms without lungs such as insects or plants sulfite in high concentration prevents respiration sulfur trioxide made by catalysis from sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid are similarly highly acidic and corrosive in the presence of water sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent that can strip available water molecules and water components from sugar and organic tissue 79 the burning of coal and or petroleum by industry and power plants generates sulfur dioxide so2 that reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid h2so4 and sulfurous acid h2so3 these acids are components of acid rain lowering the ph of soil and freshwater bodies sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the environment and chemical weathering of statues and structures fuel standards increasingly require that fuel producers extract sulfur from fossil fuels to prevent acid rain formation this extracted and refined sulfur represents a large portion of sulfur production in coal-fired power plants flue gases are sometimes purified more modern power plants that use synthesis gas extract the sulfur before they burn the gas hydrogen sulfide is as toxic as hydrogen cyanide and kills by the same mechanism inhibition of the respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase 80 though hydrogen sulfide is less likely to cause surprise poisonings from small inhaled amounts because of its disagreeable odor hydrogen sulfide quickly deadens the sense of smell and a victim may breathe increasing quantities without noticing the increase until severe symptoms cause death dissolved sulfide and hydrosulfide salts are toxic by the same mechanism see also
