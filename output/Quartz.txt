racemic references 1 4 5 6 quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen atoms in a continuous framework of sio4 silicon oxygen tetrahedra with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra giving an overall chemical formula of sio2 quartz is the second most abundant mineral in earth s continental crust behind feldspar 7 quartz crystals are chiral and exist in two forms the normal -quartz and the high-temperature -quartz the transformation from -quartz to -quartz takes place abruptly at 573 c 846 k since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature limit there are many different varieties of quartz several of which are semi-precious gemstones since antiquity varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and hardstone carvings especially in eurasia contents 1 etymology 2 crystal habit and structure 3 varieties according to

artificial treatments 6 occurrence 7 related silica minerals 8 history 9 piezoelectricity 10 see also 11 references 12 external links etymology the word quartz is derived from the german word quarz which had the same form in the first half of the 14th century in middle high german in east central german 8 and which came from the polish dialect term kwardy which corresponds to the czech term tvrd hard 9 the ancient greeks referred to quartz as krustallos derived from the ancient greek kruos meaning icy cold because some philosophers including theophrastus apparently believed the mineral to be a form of supercooled ice 10 today the term rock crystal is sometimes used as an alternative name for the purest form of quartz crystal habit and structure quartz mineral embedded in limestone top right of the sample easily identifiable by its hexagonal form it cannot be scratched by steel see mohs scale quartz belongs to the trigonal crystal system the ideal crystal shape is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramids at each end in nature quartz crystals are often twinned with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals distorted or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive well-formed crystals typically form in a bed that has unconstrained growth into a void usually the crystals are attached at the other end to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present however doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment for instance within gypsum a quartz geode is such a situation where the void is approximately spherical in shape lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward -quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system space group p3121 or p3221 depending on the chirality -quartz belongs to the hexagonal system space group p6222 and p6422 respectively 11 these space groups are truly chiral they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs both -quartz and -quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks sio4 tetrahedra in the present case the transformation between - and -quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another without change in the way they are linked crystal structure of -quartz red balls are oxygen grey are silicon -quartz varieties according to microstructure although many of the varietal names historically arose from the color of the mineral current scientific naming schemes refer primarily to the microstructure of the mineral color is a secondary identifier for the cryptocrystalline minerals although it is a primary identifier for the macrocrystalline varieties 12 major varieties of quartz type color description transparent herkimer diamond colorless transparent rock crystal colorless transparent amethyst purple transparent ametrine zones of purple and yellow or orange transparent rose quartz pink may display diasterism transparent chalcedony cryptocrystalline quartz and moganite mixture the term is generally only used for white or lightly colored material otherwise more specific names are used carnelian reddish orange chalcedony translucent aventurine chalcedony with small inclusions usually mica that shimmer translucent agate multi-colored banded chalcedony semi-translucent to translucent onyx agate where the bands are straight parallel and consistent in size jasper cryptocrystalline quartz typically red to brown opaque milky quartz white may display diasterism translucent to opaque smoky quartz brown to gray opaque tiger s eye fibrous gold to red-brown colored quartz exhibiting chatoyancy citrine yellow to reddish orange to brown greenish yellow transparent prasiolite mint green transparent rutilated quartz contains acicular needle-like inclusions of rutile dumortierite quartz contains large amounts of dumortierite crystals varieties according to color quartz crystal demonstrating transparency pure quartz traditionally called rock crystal or clear quartz is colorless and transparent or translucent and has often been used for hardstone carvings such as the lothair crystal common colored varieties include citrine rose quartz amethyst smoky quartz milky quartz and others 13 the most important distinction between types of quartz is that of macrocrystalline individual crystals visible to the unaided eye and the microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline varieties aggregates of crystals visible only under high magnification the cryptocrystalline varieties are either translucent or mostly opaque while the transparent varieties tend to be macrocrystalline chalcedony is a cryptocrystalline form of silica consisting of fine intergrowths of both quartz and its monoclinic polymorph moganite 14 other opaque gemstone varieties of quartz or mixed rocks including quartz often including contrasting bands or patterns of color are agate carnelian or sard onyx heliotrope and jasper amethyst amethyst is a form of quartz that ranges from a bright to dark or dull purple color the world s largest deposits of amethysts can be found in brazil mexico uruguay russia france namibia and morocco sometimes amethyst and citrine are found growing in the same crystal it is then referred to as ametrine an amethyst is formed when there is iron in the area where it was formed blue quartz blue quartz contains inclusions of fibrous magnesio-riebeckite or crocidolite 15 dumortierite quartz inclusions of the mineral dumortierite within quartz pieces often result in silky-appearing splotches with a blue hue shades giving off purple and or grey colors additionally being found dumortierite quartz sometimes called blue quartz will sometimes feature contrasting light and dark color zones across the material 16 17 interest in the certain quality forms of blue quartz as a collectible gemstone particularly arises in india and in the united states 16 citrine citrine is a variety of quartz whose color ranges from a pale yellow to brown due to ferric impurities natural citrines are rare most commercial citrines are heat-treated amethysts or smoky quartzes however a heat-treated amethyst will have small lines in the crystal as opposed to a natural citrine s cloudy or smokey appearance it is nearly impossible to differentiate between cut citrine and yellow topaz visually but they differ in hardness brazil is the leading producer of citrine with much of its production coming from the state of rio grande do sul the name is derived from the latin word citrina which means yellow and is also the origin of the word citron sometimes citrine and amethyst can be found together in the same crystal which is then referred to as ametrine 18 citrine has been referred to as the merchant s stone or money stone due to a superstition that it would bring prosperity 19 citrine was first appreciated as a golden-yellow gemstone in greece between 300 and 150 bc during the hellenistic age the yellow quartz was used prior to that to decorate jewelry and tools but it was not highly sought-after 20 milky quartz milk quartz or milky quartz is the most common variety of crystalline quartz the white color is caused by minute fluid inclusions of gas liquid or both trapped during crystal formation 21 making it of little value for optical and quality gemstone applications 22 rose quartz rose quartz is a type of quartz which exhibits a pale pink to rose red hue the color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of titanium iron or manganese in the material some rose quartz contains microscopic rutile needles which produces an asterism in transmitted light recent x-ray diffraction studies suggest that the color is due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly dumortierite within the quartz 23 additionally there is a rare type of pink quartz also frequently called crystalline rose quartz with color that is thought to be caused by trace amounts of phosphate or aluminium the color in crystals is apparently photosensitive and subject to fading the first crystals were found in a pegmatite found near rumford maine usa and in minas gerais brazil 24 smoky quartz smoky quartz is a gray translucent version of quartz it ranges in clarity from almost complete transparency to a brownish-gray crystal that is almost opaque some can also be black the translucency results from natural irradiation creating free silicon within the crystal prasiolite prasiolite also known as vermarine is a variety of quartz that is green in color since 1950 almost all natural prasiolite has come from a small brazilian mine but it is also seen in lower silesia in poland naturally occurring prasiolite is also found in the thunder bay area of canada it is a rare mineral in nature most green quartz is heat-treated amethyst 25 herkimer diamond rock crystal ametrine amethyst blue quartz chalcedony citrine rose quartz prasiolite rutilated quartz sceptred quartz smoky quartz synthetic and artificial treatments a synthetic quartz crystal grown by the hydrothermal method about 19 cm long and weighing about 127 grams not all varieties of quartz are naturally occurring some clear quartz crystals can be treated using heat or gamma-irradiation to induce color where it would not otherwise have occurred naturally susceptibility to such treatments depends on the location from which the quartz was mined 26 prasiolite an olive colored material is produced by heat treatment natural prasiolite has also been observed in lower silesia in poland although citrine occurs naturally the majority is the result of heat-treated amethyst carnelian is widely heat-treated to deepen its color because natural quartz is often twinned synthetic quartz is produced for use in industry large flawless single crystals are synthesized in an autoclave via the hydrothermal process emeralds are also synthesized in this fashion like other crystals quartz may be coated with metal vapors to give it an attractive sheen occurrence granite rock in the cliff of gros la t te aride island seychelles the thin 1-3 cm wide brighter layers are quartz veins formed during the late stages of crystallization of granitic magmas they are sometimes called hydrothermal veins quartz is a defining constituent of granite and other felsic igneous rocks it is very common in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and shale it is a common constituent of schist gneiss quartzite and other metamorphic rocks quartz has the lowest potential for weathering in the goldich dissolution series and consequently it is very common as a residual mineral in stream sediments and residual soils while the majority of quartz crystallizes from molten magma much quartz also chemically precipitates from hot hydrothermal veins as gangue sometimes with ore minerals like gold silver and copper large crystals of quartz are found in magmatic pegmatites well-formed crystals may reach several meters in length and weigh hundreds of kilograms naturally occurring quartz crystals of extremely high purity necessary for the crucibles and other equipment used for growing silicon wafers in the semiconductor industry are expensive and rare a major mining location for high purity quartz is the spruce pine gem mine in spruce pine north carolina united states 27 quartz may also be found in caldoveiro peak in asturias spain 28 the largest documented single crystal of quartz was found near itapore goiaz brazil it measured approximately 6.1 1.5 1.5 m and weighed more than 44 tonnes 29 related silica minerals tridymite and cristobalite are high-temperature polymorphs of sio2 that occur in high-silica volcanic rocks coesite is a denser polymorph of sio2 found in some meteorite impact sites and in metamorphic rocks formed at pressures greater than those typical of the earth s crust stishovite is a yet denser and higher-pressure polymorph of sio2 found in some meteorite impact sites lechatelierite is an amorphous silica glass sio2 which is formed by lightning strikes in quartz sand history fatimid ewer in carved rock crystal clear quartz with gold lid c 1000 the word quartz comes from the german help info 30 which is of slavic origin czech miners called it k emen other sources attribute the word s origin to the saxon word querkluftertz meaning cross-vein ore 31 quartz is the most common material identified as the mystical substance maban in australian aboriginal mythology it is found regularly in passage tomb cemeteries in europe in a burial context such as newgrange or carrowmore in ireland the irish word for quartz is grianchloch which means sunstone quartz was also used in prehistoric ireland as well as many other countries for stone tools both vein quartz and rock crystal were knapped as part of the lithic technology of the prehistoric peoples 32 while jade has been since earliest times the most prized semi-precious stone for carving in east asia and pre-columbian america in europe and the middle east the different varieties of quartz were the most commonly used for the various types of jewelry and hardstone carving including engraved gems and cameo gems rock crystal vases and extravagant vessels the tradition continued to produce objects that were very highly valued until the mid-19th century when it largely fell from fashion except in jewelry cameo technique exploits the bands of color in onyx and other varieties rock crystal jug with cut festoon decoration by milan workshop from the second half of the 16th century national museum in warsaw the city of milan apart from prague and florence was the main renaissance centre for crystal cutting 33 roman naturalist pliny the elder believed quartz to be water ice permanently frozen after great lengths of time 34 the word crystal comes from the greek word ice he supported this idea by saying that quartz is found near glaciers in the alps but not on volcanic mountains and that large quartz crystals were fashioned into spheres to cool the hands this idea persisted until at least the 17th century he also knew of the ability of quartz to split light into a spectrum in the 17th century nicolas steno s study of quartz paved the way for modern crystallography he discovered that regardless of a quartz crystal s size or shape its long prism faces always joined at a perfect 60 angle 35 quartz s piezoelectric properties were discovered by jacques and pierre curie in 1880 36 37 the quartz oscillator or resonator was first developed by walter guyton cady in 1921 38 39 george washington pierce designed and patented quartz crystal oscillators in 1923 40 41 42 warren marrison created the first quartz oscillator clock based on the work of cady and pierce in 1927 43 efforts to synthesize quartz began in the mid nineteenth century as scientists attempted to create minerals under laboratory conditions that mimicked the conditions in which the minerals formed in nature german geologist karl emil von schafh utl 1803 1890 44 was the first person to synthesize quartz when in 1845 he created microscopic quartz crystals in a pressure cooker 45 however the quality and size of the crystals that were produced by these early efforts were poor 46 synthetic quartz crystals produced in the autoclave shown in western electric s pilot hydrothermal quartz plant in 1959 by the 1930s the electronics industry had become dependent on quartz crystals the only source of suitable crystals was brazil however world war ii disrupted the supplies from brazil so nations attempted to synthesize quartz on a commercial scale german mineralogist richard nacken 1884 1971 achieved some success during the 1930s and 1940s 47 after the war many laboratories attempted to grow large quartz crystals in the united states the u s army signal corps contracted with bell laboratories and with the brush development company of cleveland ohio to synthesize crystals following nacken s lead 48 49 prior to world war ii brush development produced piezoelectric crystals for record players by 1948 brush development had grown crystals that were 1.5 inches 3.8 cm in diameter the largest to date 50 51 by the 1950s hydrothermal synthesis techniques were producing synthetic quartz crystals on an industrial scale and today virtually all the quartz crystal used in the modern electronics industry is synthetic piezoelectricity some types of quartz crystals have piezoelectric properties they develop an electric potential upon the application of mechanical stress 52 an early use of this property of quartz crystals was in phonograph pickups one of the most common piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a crystal oscillator the quartz clock is a familiar device using the mineral the resonant frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator is changed by mechanically loading it and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in the quartz crystal microbalance and in thin-film thickness monitors see also dallasite fused quartz list of minerals quartz reef mining quartzolite shocked quartz references a b mindat
