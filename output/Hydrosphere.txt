https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere hydrosphere from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the hydrosphere from greek hyd r water 1 and sphaira sphere 2 is the combined mass of water found on under and above the surface of a planet minor planet or natural satellite it has been estimated that there are 1386 million cubic kilometers of water on earth 3 this includes water in liquid and frozen forms in groundwater oceans lakes and streams saltwater accounts for 97.5 of this amount fresh water accounts for only 2.5 of this fresh water 68.9 is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in the arctic the antarctic and mountain glaciers 30.8 is in the form of fresh groundwater only 0.3 of the fresh water on earth is in easily accessible lakes reservoirs and river systems 3 the total mass of the earth s hydrosphere is about 1.4 1018 tonnes which is about 0.023 of earth s total mass about 20 1012 tonnes of this is in earth s atmosphere for practical purposes 1 cubic meter of water weighs one tonne approximately 75 of earth s surface an area of some 361 million square kilometers 139.5 million square miles is covered by ocean the average salinity of earth s oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water 3.5 4 contents 1 water cycle 2 recharging reservoirs 3 specific fresh water availability 4 see also 5 notes 6 references 7 external links water cycle edit the water cycle refers to the transfer of water from one state or reservoir to another reservoirs include atmospheric moisture snow rain and clouds streams oceans rivers lakes groundwater subterranean aquifers polar ice caps and saturated soil solar energy in the form of heat and light insolation and gravity cause the transfer from one state to another over periods from hours to thousands of years most evaporation comes from the oceans and is returned to the earth as snow or rain 5 27 sublimation refers to evaporation from snow and ice transpiration refers to the expiration of water through the minute pores or stomata of trees evapotranspiration is the term used by hydrologists in reference to the three processes together transpiration sublimation and evaporation 5 marq de villiers has described the hydrosphere as a closed system in which water exists the hydrosphere is intricate complex interdependent all-pervading and stable and seems purpose-built for regulating life 5 26 de villiers claimed that on earth the total amount of water has almost certainly not changed since geological times what we had then we still have water can be polluted abused and misused but it is neither created nor destroyed it only migrates there is no evidence that water vapor escapes into space 5 26 every year the turnover of water on earth involves 577,000 km3 of water this is water that evaporates from the oceanic surface 502,800 km3 and from land 74,200 km3 the same amount of water falls as atmospheric precipitation 458,000 km3 on the ocean and 119,000 km3 on land the difference between precipitation and evaporation from the land surface 119,000 - 74,200 44,800 km3 year represents the total runoff of the earth s rivers 42,700 km3 year and direct groundwater runoff to the ocean 2100 km3 year these are the principal sources of fresh water to support life necessities and man s economic activities 3 water is a basic necessity of life since 2 3 of the earth is covered by water the earth is also called the blue planet and the watery planet notes 1 hydrosphere plays an important role in the existence of the atmosphere in its present form oceans are important in this regard when the earth was formed it had only a very thin atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium similar to the present atmosphere of mercury later the gases hydrogen and helium were expelled from the atmosphere the gases and water vapor released as the earth cooled became its present atmosphere other gases and water vapor released by volcanoes also entered the atmosphere as the earth cooled the water vapor in the atmosphere condensed and fell as rain the atmosphere cooled further as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in to rain water in turn this further caused the water vapor to condense and fall as rain this rain water filled the depressions on the earth s surface and formed the oceans it is estimated that this occurred about 4000 million years ago the first life forms began in the oceans these organisms did not breathe oxygen later when cyanobacteria evolved the process of conversion of carbon dioxide into food and oxygen began as a result earth s atmosphere has a distinctly different composition from that of other planets and allowed for life to evolve on earth recharging reservoirs edit according to igor a shiklomanov it takes 2500 years for the complete recharge and replenishment of oceanic waters 10,000 years for permafrost and ice 1500 years for deep groundwater and mountainous glaciers 17 years in lakes and 16 days in rivers 3 specific fresh water availability edit specific water availability is the residual after use per capita quantity of fresh water 3 fresh water resources are unevenly distributed in terms of space and time and can go from floods to water shortages within months in the same area in 1998 76 of the total population had a specific water availability of less than 5.0 thousand m3 per year per capita already by 1998 35 of the global population suffered very low or catastrophically low water supplies and shiklomanov predicted that the situation would deteriorate in the twenty-first century with most of the earth s population will be living under the conditions of low or catastrophically low water supply by 2025 there is only 2.5 of fresh water in the hydrosphere and only 0.25 of water is accessible for our use see also edit biosphere cryosphere earth s atmosphere lithosphere ocean pedosphere water cycle notes edit according to planetary geologist ronald greeley water is very common in the outer solar system citation needed europa holds more water than earth s oceans references edit henry george liddell robert scott a greek-english lexicon on perseus henry george liddell robert scott a greek-english lexicon on perseus a b c d e report unesco 1998 archived from on 27 september 2013 retrieved 13 june 2013 kennish michael j 2001 practical handbook of marine science marine science series 3rd ed crc press p 35 isbn 0-8493-2391-6 a b c d marq de villiers 2003 water the fate of our most precious resource 2 ed toronto ontario mcclelland stewart p 453 isbn 978-0-7710-2641-6 oclc revised 2003 governor general s award 1999 external links edit look up hydrosphere in wiktionary the free dictionary retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title hydrosphere oldid 826007406 categories aquatic ecology hydrology physical geography global natural environment water hidden categories all articles with unsourced statements articles with unsourced statements from november 2014 navigation menu search this page was last edited on 16 february 2018 at 17 48 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
