https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_minimum solar minimum from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search three recent solar cycles solar minimum is the period of least solar activity in the 11 year solar cycle of the sun during this time sunspot and solar flare activity diminishes and often does not occur for days at a time the date of the minimum is described by a smoothed average over 12 months of sunspot activity so identifying the date of the solar minimum usually can only happen 6 months after the minimum takes place solar minima are not generally correlated with changes in climate but recent studies have shown a correlation with regional weather patterns solar minimum is contrasted with the solar maximum where there may be hundreds of sunspots contents 1 solar minimum and solar maximum 2 predicting solar minimum cycles 3 grand solar minima and maxima 4 see also 5 references 6 external links solar minimum and solar maximum edit solar minima and maxima are the two extremes of the sun s 11-year activity cycle 1 at a maximum the sun is peppered with sunspots solar flares erupt and the sun hurls billion-ton clouds of electrified gas into space it s a good time for sky watchers who enjoy auroras but not so good for astronauts who have to be wary of radiation storms power outages satellite malfunction and communication disruptions and gps receiver malfunctions are just a few of the things that can happen during a solar maximum 2 at a solar minimum there are fewer sunspots and solar flares subside sometimes days or weeks go by without a spot it is a safer time to travel through space but a less interesting time to watch polar skies predicting solar minimum cycles edit their non-linear character makes predictions of solar activity very difficult 3 the solar minimum is characterized by a period of decreased solar activity with few if any sunspots the accompanying decrease in solar radiation makes it the safest time for astronauts to carry out space missions three nasa scientists were better able to predict solar cycles solar minima and solar maxima using a simple function with four parameters 4 which then led the ability to discover the duration of these solar cycles scientists from the national center for atmospheric research ncar also developed a computer model of solar dynamics solar dynamo for more accurate predictions and have confidence in the forecast based upon a series of test runs with the newly developed model simulating the strength of the past eight solar cycles with more than 98 accuracy 5 in hindsight the prediction proved to be wildly inaccurate and not representative of the observed sunspot numbers 6 during 2008 2009 nasa scientists noted that the sun is undergoing a deep solar minimum stating there were no sunspots observed on 266 of 2008 s 366 days 73 prompted by these numbers some observers suggested that the solar cycle had hit bottom in 2008 sunspot counts for 2009 dropped even lower as of september 14 2009 there were no sunspots on 206 of the year s 257 days 80 it adds up to one inescapable conclusion we re experiencing a very deep solar minimum says solar physicist dean pesnell of the goddard space flight center this is the quietest sun we ve seen in almost a century agrees sunspot expert david hathaway of the national space science and technology center nasa marshall space flight center 7 grand solar minima and maxima edit grand solar minima occur when several solar cycles exhibit lesser than average activity for decades or centuries solar cycles still occur during these grand solar minimum periods but are at a lower intensity than usual grand solar minima have shown some correlation with global and regional climate changes 400 year history of
