genera and c 295,383 known species 8 like gymnosperms angiosperms are seed-producing plants however they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers endosperm within the seeds and the production of fruits that contain the seeds etymologically angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure in other words a fruiting plant the term comes from the greek words angeion case or casing and sperma seed the ancestors of flowering plants diverged from gymnosperms in the triassic period 245 to 202 million years ago mya and the first flowering plants are known from 160 mya they diversified extensively during the lower cretaceous became widespread by 120 mya and replaced conifers as the dominant trees from 100 to 60 mya contents 1 description 1.1

external links description edit angiosperm derived characteristics edit angiosperms differ from other seed plants in several ways described in the table below these distinguishing characteristics taken together have made the angiosperms the most diverse and numerous land plants and the most commercially important group to humans a distinctive features of angiosperms feature description flowering organs flowers the reproductive organs of flowering plants are the most remarkable feature distinguishing them from the other seed plants flowers provided angiosperms with the means to have a more species-specific breeding system and hence a way to evolve more readily into different species without the risk of crossing back with related species faster speciation enabled the angiosperms to adapt to a wider range of ecological niches this has allowed flowering plants to largely dominate terrestrial ecosystems citation needed stamens with two pairs of pollen sacs stamens are much lighter than the corresponding organs of gymnosperms and have contributed to the diversification of angiosperms through time with adaptations to specialized pollination syndromes such as particular pollinators stamens have also become modified through time to prevent self-fertilization which has permitted further diversification allowing angiosperms eventually to fill more niches reduced male parts three cells the male gametophyte in angiosperms is significantly reduced in size compared to those of gymnosperm seed plants citation needed the smaller size of the pollen reduces the amount of time between pollination the pollen grain reaching the female plant and fertilization in gymnosperms fertilization can occur up to a year after pollination whereas in angiosperms fertilization begins very soon after pollination 9 the shorter amount of time between pollination and fertilization allows angiosperms to produce seeds earlier after pollination than gymnosperms providing angiosperms a distinct evolutionary advantage closed carpel enclosing the ovules carpel or carpels and accessory parts may become the fruit the closed carpel of angiosperms also allows adaptations to specialized pollination syndromes and controls this helps to prevent self-fertilization thereby maintaining increased diversity once the ovary is fertilized the carpel and some surrounding tissues develop into a fruit this fruit often serves as an attractant to seed-dispersing animals the resulting cooperative relationship presents another advantage to angiosperms in the process of dispersal reduced female gametophyte seven cells with eight nuclei the reduced female gametophyte like the reduced male gametophyte may be an adaptation allowing for more rapid seed set eventually leading to such flowering plant adaptations as annual herbaceous life-cycles allowing the flowering plants to fill even more niches endosperm in general endosperm formation begins after fertilization and before the first division of the zygote endosperm is a highly nutritive tissue that can provide food for the developing embryo the cotyledons and sometimes the seedling when it first appears vascular anatomy edit cross-section of a stem of the angiosperm flax 1 pith 2 protoxylem 3 xylem i 4 phloem i 5 sclerenchyma bast fibre 6 cortex 7 epidermis the amount and complexity of tissue-formation in flowering plants exceeds that of gymnosperms the vascular bundles of the stem are arranged such that the xylem and phloem form concentric rings in the dicotyledons the bundles in the very young stem are arranged in an open ring separating a central pith from an outer cortex in each bundle separating the xylem and phloem is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue known as cambium by the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles interfascicular cambium a complete ring is formed and a regular periodical increase in thickness results from the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside the soft phloem becomes crushed but the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial owing to differences in the character of the elements produced at the beginning and end of the season the wood is marked out in transverse section into concentric rings one for each season of growth called annual rings among the monocotyledons the bundles are more numerous in the young stem and are scattered through the ground tissue they contain no cambium and once formed the stem increases in diameter only in exceptional cases reproductive anatomy edit a collection of flowers forming an inflorescence the characteristic feature of angiosperms is the flower flowers show remarkable variation in form and elaboration and provide the most trustworthy external characteristics for establishing relationships among angiosperm species the function of the flower is to ensure fertilization of the ovule and development of fruit containing seeds the floral apparatus may arise terminally on a shoot or from the axil of a leaf where the petiole attaches to the stem occasionally as in violets a flower arises singly in the axil of an ordinary foliage-leaf more typically the flower-bearing portion of the plant is sharply distinguished from the foliage-bearing or vegetative portion and forms a more or less elaborate branch-system called an inflorescence there are two kinds of reproductive cells produced by flowers microspores which will divide to become pollen grains are the male cells and are borne in the stamens or microsporophylls the female cells called megaspores which will divide to become the egg cell megagametogenesis are contained in the ovule and enclosed in the carpel or megasporophyll the flower may consist only of these parts as in willow where each flower comprises only a few stamens or two carpels usually other structures are present and serve to protect the sporophylls and to form an envelope attractive to pollinators the individual members of these surrounding structures are known as sepals and petals or tepals in flowers such as magnolia where sepals and petals are not distinguishable from each other the outer series calyx of sepals is usually green and leaf-like and functions to protect the rest of the flower especially the bud the inner series corolla of petals is in general white or brightly colored and is more delicate in structure it functions to attract insect or bird pollinators attraction is effected by color scent and nectar which may be secreted in some part of the flower the characteristics that attract pollinators account for the popularity of flowers and flowering plants among humans while the majority of flowers are perfect or hermaphrodite having both pollen and ovule producing parts in the same flower structure flowering plants have developed numerous morphological and physiological mechanisms to reduce or prevent self-fertilization heteromorphic flowers have short carpels and long stamens or vice versa so animal pollinators cannot easily transfer pollen to the pistil receptive part of the carpel homomorphic flowers may employ a biochemical physiological mechanism called self-incompatibility to discriminate between self and non-self pollen grains in other species the male and female parts are morphologically separated developing on different flowers taxonomy edit history of classification edit from 1736 an illustration of linnaean classification the botanical term angiosperm from the ancient greek ange on bottle vessel and seed was coined in the form angiospermae by paul hermann in 1690 as the name of one of his primary divisions of the plant kingdom this included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules distinguished from his gymnospermae or flowering plants with achenial or schizo-carpic fruits the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked the term and its antonym were maintained by carl linnaeus with the same sense but with restricted application in the names of the orders of his class didynamia its use with any approach to its modern scope became possible only after 1827 when robert brown established the existence of truly naked ovules in the cycadeae and coniferae 10 and applied to them the name gymnosperms citation needed from that time onward as long as these gymnosperms were as was usual reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants the term angiosperm was used antithetically by botanical writers with varying scope as a group-name for other dicotyledonous plants an auxanometer a device for measuring increase or rate of growth in plants in 1851 hofmeister discovered the changes occurring in the embryo-sac of flowering plants and determined the correct relationships of these to the cryptogamia this fixed the position of gymnosperms as a class distinct from dicotyledons and the term angiosperm then gradually came to be accepted as the suitable designation for the whole of the flowering plants other than gymnosperms including the classes of dicotyledons and monocotyledons this is the sense in which the term is used today in most taxonomies the flowering plants are treated as a coherent group the most popular descriptive name has been angiospermae angiosperms with anthophyta flowering plants a second choice these names are not linked to any rank the wettstein system and the engler system use the name angiospermae at the assigned rank of subdivision the reveal system treated flowering plants as subdivision magnoliophytina frohne u jensen ex reveal phytologia 79 70 1996 but later split it to magnoliopsida liliopsida and rosopsida the takhtajan system and cronquist system treat this group at the rank of division leading to the name magnoliophyta from the family name magnoliaceae the dahlgren system and thorne system 1992 treat this group at the rank of class leading to the name magnoliopsida the apg system of 1998 and the later 2003 11 and 2009 12 revisions treat the flowering plants as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name however a formal classification was published alongside the 2009 revision in which the flowering plants form the subclass magnoliidae 13 the internal classification of this group has undergone considerable revision the cronquist system proposed by arthur cronquist in 1968 and published in its full form in 1981 is still widely used but is no longer believed to accurately reflect phylogeny a consensus about how the flowering plants should be arranged has recently begun to emerge through the work of the angiosperm phylogeny group apg which published an influential reclassification of the angiosperms in 1998 updates incorporating more recent research were published as the apg ii system in 2003 11 the apg iii system in 2009 12 14 and the apg iv system in 2016 traditionally the flowering plants are divided into two groups dicotyledoneae or magnoliopsida monocotyledoneae or liliopsida which in the cronquist system are called magnoliopsida at the rank of class formed from the family name magnoliaceae and liliopsida at the rank of class formed from the family name liliaceae other descriptive names allowed by article 16 of the icbn include dicotyledones or dicotyledoneae and monocotyledones or monocotyledoneae which have a long history of use in english a member of either group may be called a dicotyledon plural dicotyledons and monocotyledon plural monocotyledons or abbreviated as dicot plural dicots and monocot plural monocots these names derive from the observation that the dicots most often have two cotyledons or embryonic leaves within each seed the monocots usually have only one but the rule is not absolute either way from a broad diagnostic point of view the number of cotyledons is neither a particularly handy nor a reliable character recent studies as by the apg show that the monocots form a monophyletic group clade but that the dicots do not they are paraphyletic nevertheless the majority of dicot species do form a monophyletic group called the eudicots or tricolpates of the remaining dicot species most belong to a third major clade known as the magnoliids containing about 9,000 species the rest include a paraphyletic grouping of early branching taxa known collectively as the basal angiosperms plus the families ceratophyllaceae and chloranthaceae modern classification edit monocot left and dicot seedlings there are eight groups of living angiosperms basal angiosperms ana amborella nymphaeales austrobaileyales amborella a single species of shrub from new caledonia nymphaeales about 80 species 15 water lilies and hydatellaceae austrobaileyales about 100 species 15 of woody plants from various parts of the world core angiosperms mesangiospermae 13 chloranthales several dozen species of aromatic plants with toothed leaves magnoliids about 9,000 species 15 characterized by trimerous flowers pollen with one pore and usually branching-veined leaves for example magnolias bay laurel and black pepper monocots about 70,000 species 15 characterized by trimerous flowers a single cotyledon pollen with one pore and usually parallel-veined leaves for example grasses orchids and palms ceratophyllum about 6 species 15 of aquatic plants perhaps most familiar as aquarium plants eudicots about 175,000 species 15 characterized by 4- or 5-merous flowers pollen with three pores and usually branching-veined leaves for example sunflowers petunia buttercup apples and oaks the exact relationship between these eight groups is not yet clear although there is agreement that the first three groups to diverge from the ancestral angiosperm were amborellales nymphaeales and austrobaileyales 16 the term basal angiosperms refers to these three groups among the remaining five groups core angiosperms the relationship between the three broadest of these groups magnoliids monocots and eudicots remains unclear zeng and colleagues fig 1 describe four competing schemes 17 of these eudicots and monocots are the largest and most diversified with 75 and 20 of angiosperm species respectively some analyses make the magnoliids the first to diverge others the monocots 18 ceratophyllum seems to group with the eudicots rather than with the monocots the 2016 angiosperm

on land for at least 475 million years 19 early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated swimming sperm like the green algae from which they evolved an adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats this feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives the charophycean green algae a later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate avascular sexual stage the gametophyte within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte this occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release as in non-seed plants a current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in selaginella the spike-moss the result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case the seed the first seed bearing plants like the ginkgo and conifers such as pines and firs did not produce flowers the pollen grains male gametophytes of ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated mobile sperm cells that swim down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs flowers of malus sylvestris crab apple the apparently sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record initially posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that charles darwin called it an abominable mystery 20 however the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of darwin and recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as archaefructus along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps several groups of extinct gymnosperms in particular seed ferns have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved some older fossils such as the upper triassic sanmiguelia have been suggested based on current evidence some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms in the triassic period 245 202 million years ago fossil angiosperm-like pollen from the middle triassic 247.2 242.0 ma suggests an older date for their origin 21 a close relationship between angiosperms and gnetophytes proposed on the basis of morphological evidence has more recently been disputed on the basis of molecular evidence that suggest gnetophytes are instead more closely related to other gymnosperms citation needed the evolution of seed plants and later angiosperms appears to be the result of two distinct rounds of whole genome duplication events 22 these occurred at million years ago and million years ago another possible whole genome duplication event at million years ago perhaps created the ancestral line that led to all modern flowering plants 23 that event was studied by sequencing the genome of an ancient flowering plant amborella trichopoda 24 and directly addresses darwin s abominable mystery flowers and leaves of oxalis pes-caprae bermuda buttercup the earliest known macrofossil confidently identified as an angiosperm archaefructus liaoningensis is dated to about 125 million years bp the cretaceous period 25 whereas pollen considered to be of angiosperm origin takes the fossil record back to about 130 million years bp however one study has suggested that the early-middle jurassic plant schmeissneria traditionally considered a type of ginkgo may be the earliest known angiosperm or at least a close relative 26 in addition circumstantial chemical evidence has been found for the existence of angiosperms as early as 250 million years ago oleanane a secondary metabolite produced by many flowering plants has been found in permian deposits of that age together with fossils of gigantopterids 27 28 gigantopterids are a group of extinct seed plants that share many morphological traits with flowering plants although they are not known to have been flowering plants themselves in 2013 flowers encased in amber were found and dated 100 million years before present the amber had frozen the act of sexual reproduction in the process of taking place microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower s stigma the pollen was sticky suggesting it was carried by insects 29 recent dna analysis based on molecular systematics 30 31 showed that amborella trichopoda found on the pacific island of new caledonia belongs to a sister group of the other flowering plants and morphological studies 32 suggest that it has features that may have been characteristic of the earliest flowering plants the orders amborellales nymphaeales and austrobaileyales diverged as separate lineages from the remaining angiosperm clade at a very early stage in flowering plant evolution 33 the great angiosperm radiation when a great diversity of angiosperms appears in the fossil record occurred in the mid-cretaceous approximately 100 million years ago however a study in 2007 estimated that the division of the five most recent the genus ceratophyllum the family chloranthaceae the eudicots the magnoliids and the monocots of the eight main groups occurred around 140 million years ago 34 by the late cretaceous angiosperms appear to have dominated environments formerly occupied by ferns and cycadophytes but large canopy-forming trees replaced conifers as the dominant trees only close to the end of the cretaceous 66 million years ago or even later at the beginning of the tertiary 35 the radiation of herbaceous angiosperms occurred much later 36 yet many fossil plants recognizable as belonging to modern families including beech oak maple and magnolia had already appeared by the late cretaceous it has been proposed that the swift rise of angiosperms to dominance was facilitated by a reduction in their genome size during the early cretaceous period only angiosperms underwent rapid genome downsizing while genome sizes of ferns and gymnosperms remained unchanged smaller genomes and smaller nuclei allow for faster rates of cell division and smaller cells thus species with smaller genomes can pack more smaller cells in particular veins and stomata into a given leaf volume genome downsizing therefore facilitated higher rates of leaf gas exchange transpiration and photosynthesis and faster rates of growth this would have countered some of the negative physiological effects of genome duplications facilitated increased uptake of carbon dioxide despite concurrent declines in atmospheric co2 concentrations and allowed the flowering plants to outcompete other land plants 37 two bees on a flower head of creeping thistle cirsium arvense it is generally assumed that the function of flowers from the start was to involve mobile animals in their reproduction processes that is pollen can be scattered even if the flower is not brightly colored or oddly shaped in a way that attracts animals however by expending the energy required to create such traits angiosperms can enlist the aid of animals and thus reproduce more efficiently island genetics provides one proposed explanation for the sudden fully developed appearance of flowering plants island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation in general especially when it comes to radical adaptations that seem to have required inferior transitional forms flowering plants may have evolved in an isolated setting like an island or island chain where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal a wasp for example such a relationship with a hypothetical wasp carrying pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today could result in the development of a high degree of specialization in both the plant s and their partners note that the wasp example is not incidental bees which it is postulated evolved specifically due to mutualistic plant relationships are descended from wasps 38 animals are also involved in the distribution of seeds fruit which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts is frequently a seed-dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it incidentally scattering the seeds it contains see frugivory although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction spreading whatever its origin to become the dominant form of land plant life flower ontogeny uses a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots 39 the most primitive flowers probably had a variable number of flower parts often separate from but in contact with each other the flowers tended to grow in a spiral pattern to be bisexual in plants this means both male and female parts on the same flower and to be dominated by the ovary female part as flowers evolved some variations developed parts fused together with a much more specific number and design and with either specific sexes per flower or plant or at least ovary-inferior flower evolution continues to the present day modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans that some of them cannot be pollinated in nature many modern domesticated flower species were formerly simple weeds which sprouted only when the ground was disturbed some of them tended to grow with human crops perhaps already having symbiotic companion plant relationships with them and the prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection 40 a few paleontologists have also proposed that flowering plants or angiosperms might have evolved due to interactions with dinosaurs one of the idea s strongest proponents is robert t bakker he proposes that herbivorous dinosaurs with their eating habits provided a selective pressure on plants for which adaptations either succeeded in deterring or coping with predation by herbivores 41 in august 2017 scientists presented a detailed description and 3d model image of what the first flower possibly looked like and presented the hypothesis that it may have lived about 140 million years ago 42 43 a bayesian analysis of 52 angiosperm taxa suggested that the crown group of angisperms evolved between million years ago and million years ago 44 flowering plant diversity edit a poster of twelve different species of flowers of the asteraceae family lupinus pilosus bud of a pink rose the number of species of flowering plants is estimated to be in the range of 250,000 to 400,000 45 46 47 this compares to around 12,000 species of moss 48 or 11,000 species of pteridophytes 49 showing that the flowering plants are much more diverse the number of families in apg 1998 was 462 in apg ii 11 2003 it is not settled at maximum it is 457 but within this number there are 55 optional segregates so that the minimum number of

the families are eudicots reproduction edit fertilization and embryogenesis edit angiosperm life cycle double fertilization refers to a process in which two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovule this process begins when a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the pistil female reproductive structure germinates and grows a long pollen tube while this pollen tube is growing a haploid generative cell travels down the tube behind the tube nucleus the generative cell divides by mitosis to produce two haploid n sperm cells as the pollen tube grows it makes its way from the stigma down the style and into the ovary here the pollen tube reaches the micropyle of the ovule and digests its way into one of the synergids releasing its contents which include the sperm cells the synergid that the cells were released into degenerates and one sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell producing a diploid 2n zygote the second sperm cell fuses with both central cell nuclei producing a triploid 3n cell as the zygote develops into an embryo the triploid cell develops into the endosperm which serves as the embryo s food supply the ovary will now develop into a fruit and the ovule will develop into a seed fruit and seed edit the fruit of the aesculus or horse chestnut tree as the development of embryo and endosperm proceeds within the embryo sac the sac wall enlarges and combines with the nucellus which is likewise enlarging and the integument to form the seed coat the ovary wall develops to form the fruit or pericarp whose form is closely associated with type of seed dispersal system 53 frequently the influence of fertilization is felt beyond the ovary and other parts of the flower take part in the formation of the fruit e g the floral receptacle in the apple strawberry and others the character of the seed coat bears a definite relation to that of the fruit they protect the embryo and aid in dissemination they may also directly promote germination among plants with indehiscent fruits in general the fruit provides protection for the embryo and secures dissemination in this case the seed coat is only slightly developed if the fruit is dehiscent and the seed is exposed in general the seed-coat is well developed and must discharge the functions otherwise executed by the fruit meiosis edit flowering plants generate gametes using a specialized cell division called meiosis meiosis takes place in the ovule a structure within the ovary that is located within the pistil at the center of the flower see diagram labeled angiosperm lifecycle a diploid cell megaspore mother cell in the ovule undergoes meiosis involving two successive cell divisions to produce four cells megaspores with haploid nuclei 54 one of these four cells megaspore then undergoes three successive mitotic divisions to produce an immature embryo sac megagametophyte with eight haploid nuclei next these nuclei are segregated into separate cells by cytokinesis to producing 3 antipodal cells 2 synergid cells and an egg cell two polar nuclei are left in the central cell of the embryo sac pollen is also produced by meiosis in the male anther microsporangium during meiosis a diploid microspore mother cell undergoes two successive meiotic divisions to produce 4 haploid cells microspores or male gametes each of these microspores after further mitoses becomes a pollen grain microgametophyte containing two haploid generative sperm cells and a tube nucleus when a pollen grain makes contact with the female stigma the pollen grain forms a pollen tube that grows down the style into the ovary in the act of fertilization a male sperm nucleus fuses with the female egg nucleus to form a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the newly forming seed upon germination of the seed a new plant can grow and mature the adaptive function of meiosis is currently a matter of debate a key event during meiosis in a diploid cell is the pairing of homologous chromosomes and homologous recombination the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes this process promotes the production of increased genetic diversity among progeny and the recombinational repair of damages in the dna to be passed on to progeny to explain the adaptive function of meiosis in flowering plants some authors emphasize diversity 55 and others emphasize dna repair 56 apomixis edit apomixis reproduction via asexually formed seeds is found naturally in about 2.2 of angiosperm genera 57 one type of apomixis gametophytic apomixis found in a dandelion species 58 involves formation of an unreduced embryo sac due to incomplete meiosis apomeiosis and development of an embryo from the unreduced egg inside the embryo sac without fertilization parthenogenesis uses edit agriculture is almost entirely dependent on angiosperms which provide virtually all plant-based food and also provide a significant amount of livestock feed of all the families of plants the poaceae or grass family providing grains is by far the most important providing the bulk of all feedstocks rice maize wheat barley rye oats pearl millet sugar cane sorghum the fabaceae or legume family comes in second place also of high importance are the solanaceae or nightshade family potatoes tomatoes and peppers among others the cucurbitaceae or gourd family including pumpkins and melons the brassicaceae or mustard plant family including rapeseed and the innumerable varieties of the cabbage species brassica oleracea and the apiaceae or parsley family many of our fruits come from the rutaceae or rue family including oranges lemons grapefruits etc and the rosaceae or rose family including apples pears cherries apricots plums etc in some parts of the world certain single species assume paramount importance because of their variety of uses for example the coconut cocos nucifera on pacific atolls and the olive olea europaea in the mediterranean region flowering plants also provide economic resources in the form of wood paper fiber cotton flax and hemp among others medicines digitalis camphor decorative and landscaping plants and many other uses the main area in which they are surpassed by other plants namely coniferous trees pinales which are non-flowering gymnosperms is timber and paper production 59 see also edit list of garden plants list of plant orders list of plants by common name list of systems of plant taxonomy notes edit the major exception to the dominance of terrestrial ecosystems by flowering plants is the coniferous forest references edit a b c
