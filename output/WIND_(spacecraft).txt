station ccafs in merritt island florida aboard a mcdonnell douglas delta ii 7925-10 rocket wind was designed and manufactured by martin marietta astro space division in east windsor new jersey the satellite is a spin stabilized cylindrical satellite with a diameter of 2.4 m and a height of 1.8 m 1 it was deployed to study radio waves and plasma that occur in the solar wind and in the earth s magnetosphere the spacecraft s original mission was to orbit the sun at the l1 lagrangian point but this was delayed to study the magnetosphere and near lunar environment when the soho and ace spacecraft were sent to the same location wind has been at l1 continuously since 2004 and is still operating as of 3 march 2018 10 wind currently has enough fuel to last over 50 years at l1 wind continues to produce new and exciting scientific results and as of january 31 2017 not including 2017 publications has accumulated over 4310 refereed scientific publications 10 mission operations are conducted from the multi-mission operations center mmoc in building 14 at goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland wind data can be accessed using the spedas software wind is the sister ship

magnetospheric and ionospheric studies determine the magnetospheric output to interplanetary space in the up-stream region investigate basic plasma processes occurring in the near-earth solar wind provide baseline ecliptic plane observations to be used in heliospheric latitudes from ulysses the science instruments on the wind spacecraft edit the aim of istp is to understand the behavior of the solar-terrestrial plasma environment in order to predict how the earth s atmosphere will respond to changes in solar wind conditions wind s objective is to measure the properties of the solar wind before it reaches the earth the wind spacecraft has an array of instruments including konus 8 the wind magnetic field investigation mfi 4 the solar wind and suprathermal ion composition experiment sms 7 the energetic particles acceleration composition and transport epact investigation 9 the solar wind experiment swe 6 a three-dimensional plasma and energetic particle investigation 3dp 2 the transient gamma-ray spectrometer tgrs 3 and the radio and plasma wave investigation waves 5 the and tgrs instruments are primarily for gamma-ray and high energy photon observations of solar flares or gamma-ray bursts and part of the the sms experiment measures the mass and mass-to-charge ratios of heavy ions the swe and 3dp experiments are meant to measure analyze the lower energy below 10 mev solar wind protons and electrons the waves and mfi experiments were designed to measure the electric and magnetic fields observed in the solar wind all together the wind spacecraft s suite of instruments allows for a complete description of plasma phenomena in the solar wind plane of the ecliptic wind waves edit time domain sampler edit the electric field detectors of the wind waves instrument 5 are composed of three orthogonal electric field dipole antennas two in the spin plane roughly the plane of the ecliptic of the spacecraft and one along the spin axis the complete waves suite of instruments includes five total receivers including low frequency fft receiver called fft 0.3 hz to 11 khz thermal noise receiver called tnr 4 256 khz radio receiver band 1 called rad1 20 1040 khz radio receiver band 2 called rad2 1.075 13.825 mhz and the time domain sampler called tds designed and built by the university of minnesota the longer of the two spin plane antenna defined as ex is 100 m tip-to-tip while the shorter defined as ey is 15 m tip-to-tip the spin axis dipole defined as ez is roughly 12 m tip-to-tip when accounting for spacecraft potential these antenna lengths are adjusted to 41.1 m 3.79 m and 2.17 m note these are subject to change and only estimates and not necessarily accurate to two decimal places the wind waves instrument also detects magnetic fields using three orthogonal search coil magnetometers designed and built by the university of iowa the xy search coils are oriented to be parallel to the xy dipole antenna the search coils allow for high-frequency magnetic field measurements defined as bx by and bz the waves z-axis is anti-parallel to z-gse geocentric solar ecliptic direction thus any rotations can be done about the z-axis in the normal eulerian sense followed by a change of sign in the z-component of any gse vector rotated into waves coordinates electric and magnetic field waveform captures can be obtained from the time domain sampler tds receiver 5 tds samples are a waveform capture of 2048 points 16384 points on the stereo spacecraft per field component the waveforms are measures of electric field versus time in the highest sampling rates the fast tdsf sampler runs at 120,000 samples per second sps and the slow tdss sampler runs at 7,500 sps tdsf samples are composed of two electric field components typically ex and ey while tdss samples are composed of four vectors either three electric and one magnetic field or three magnetic and one electric field the tdsf receiver has little to no gain below about 120 hz and the search coil magnetometers roll off around 3.3 hz 11 thermal noise receiver edit the tnr measures 4 256 khz electric fields in up to 5 logarithmically spaced frequency bands though typically only set at 3 bands from 32 or 16 channels per band with a 7 nv hz 1 2 sensitivity 400 hz to 6.4 khz bandwidth and total dynamic range in excess of 100 db 5 the data are taken by two multi-channel receivers which nominally sample for 20 ms at a 1 mhz sampling rate see 5 for more information the tnr is often used to determine the local plasma density by observing the plasma line an emission at the local upper hybrid frequency due to a thermal noise response of the wire dipole antenna one should note that observation of the plasma line requires the dipole antenna to be longer than the local debye length de 12 for typical conditions in the solar wind de 7 20 m much shorter than the wire dipole antenna on wind the majority of this section was taken from 11 wind 3dp edit the wind 3dp instrument designed and built at the berkeley space sciences laboratory was designed to make full three-dimensional measurements of the distributions of suprathermal electrons and ions in the solar wind the instrument includes three arrays each consisting of a pair of double-ended semi-conductor telescopes each with two or three closely sandwiched passivated ion implanted silicon detectors which measure electrons and ions above 20 kev the instrument also has top-hat symmetrical spherical section electrostatic es analyzers with microchannel plate detectors mcps are used to measure ions and electrons from 3 ev to 30 ev 2 the two types of detectors have energy resolutions ranging from e e 0.3 for the solid state telescopes sst and e e 0.2 for the top-hat es analyzers the angular resolutions are 22.5 x 36 for the sst and 5.6 near the ecliptic to 22.5 for the top-hat es analyzers the particle detectors can obtain a full 4 steradian coverage in one full half spin 3 s for the sst top-hat es analyzers the majority of this section was taken from 11 electrostatic analyzers edit the arrays of detectors are mounted on two opposing booms each 0.5 m in length the top-hat es analyzers are composed of four separate detectors each with different geometry factors to cover different ranges of energies the electron detectors eesa and ion detectors pesa are each separated into low l and high h energy detectors the h and l analyzers contain 24 and 16 discrete anodes respectively the anode layout provides a 5.6 angular resolution within 22.5 of the ecliptic plane increases to 22.5 at normal incidence to ecliptic plane the analyzers are swept logarithmically in energy and counters sample at 1024 samples spin 3 ms sample period thus the analyzers can be set to sample 64 energy samples per sweep at 16 sweeps per spin or 32 energy samples per sweep at 32 sweeps per spin etc the detectors are defined as follows eesa low el covers electrons from 3 ev to 1 kev these values vary from moment structure to moment structure depending on duration of data sampling spacecraft potential and whether in burst or survey mode the typical range is 5 ev to 1.11 kev 11 with an 11.25 spin phase resolution el has a total geometric factor of 1.3 x 10 2 e cm2-sr where e is energy in ev with a nearly identical 180 field of view fov radial to the spacecraft to that of pesa-l eesa high eh covers electrons from 200 ev to 30 kev though typical values vary from a minimum of 137 ev to a maximum of 28 kev in a 32 sample energy sweep each 11.25 of spacecraft spin eh has a total geometric factor of 2.0 x 10 1 e cm2-sr mcp efficiency of about 70 and grid transmission of about 73 eh has a 360 planar fov tangent to the spacecraft surface which can be electro statically deflected into a cone up to 45 out of its normal plane pesa low pl covers ions with a 14 sample energy sweep note that in survey mode the data structures typically take 25 data points at 14 different energies while in burst mode they take 64 data points at 14 different energies from 100 ev to 10 kev often energies range from 700 ev to 6 kev each 5.6 of spacecraft spin pl has a total geometric factor of only 1.6 x 10 4 e cm2-sr but an identical energy-angle response to that of pesa-h while in the solar wind pl reorients itself along the bulk flow direction to capture the solar wind flow which results in a narrow range of pitch-angle coverage pesa high ph covers ions with a 15 sample energy sweep from as low as 80 ev to as high as 30 kev typical energy range is 500 ev to 28 kev 11 each 11.25 of spacecraft note that ph has multiple data modes where the number of data points per energy bin can be any of the following 121 97 88 65 or 56 ph has a total geometric factor of 1.5 x 10 2 e cm2-sr with a mcp efficiency of about 50 and grid entrance post transmission of about 75 the majority of this section was taken from 11 solid-state telescopes edit the sst detectors consist of three arrays of double-ended telescopes each of which is composed of either a pair or triplet of closely sandwiched semi-conductor detectors the center detector thick or t of the triplet is 1.5 cm2 in area 500 m thick while the other detectors foil f and open o are the same area but only 300 m thick one direction of the telescopes is covered in a thin lexan foil 1500 of aluminum evaporated on each side to completely eliminate sunlight sst-foil where the thickness was chosen to stop protons up to the energy of electrons 400 kev electrons are essentially unaffected by the foil on the opposite side sst-open a common broom magnet is used to refuse electrons below 400 kev from entering but leaves the ions essentially unaffected thus if no higher energy particles penetrate the detector walls the sst-foil should only measure electrons and the sst-open only ions each double-ended telescope has two 36 x 20 fwhm fov thus each end of the five telescopes can cover a 180 x 20 piece of space telescope 6 views the same angle to spin axis as telescope 2 but both ends of telescope 2 have a drilled tantalum cover to reduce the geometric factor by a factor of 10 to measure the most intense fluxes the sst-foil data structures typically have 7 energy bins each with 48 data points while the sst-open has 9 energy bins each with 48 data points both detectors have energy resolutions of e e 30 the majority of this section was taken from 11 wind mfi edit the magnetic field instrument mfi on board wind 4 is composed of dual triaxial fluxgate magnetometers the mfi has a dynamic range of 4 nt to 65,536 nt digital resolution ranging from 0.001 nt to 16 nt sensor noise level of 0.006 nt r m s for 0 10 hz signals and sample rates varying from 44 samples per second sps in snapshot memory to 10.87 sps in standard mode the data are also available in averages at 3 seconds 1 minute and 1 hour the data sampled at higher rates i e 10 sps is referred to as high time resolution htr data in some studies 13 14 wind swe edit the wind spacecraft has two faraday cup fc ion instruments 6 the swe fcs can produce reduced ion distribution functions with up to 20 angular and 30 energy per charge bins every 92 seconds 15 each sensor has a 15 tilt above or below the spin plane and an energy range from 150 ev to 8 kev a circular aperture limits the effects of aberration near the modulator grid and defines the collecting area of the collector plates in each fc the fcs sample at a set energy for each spacecraft rotation then step up the energy for the next rotation since there are up to 30 energy bins for these detectors a full reduced distribution function requires 30 rotations or slightly more than 90 seconds wind konus and tgrs edit konus remains a very active partner in the and the notifications of astrophysical transients are sent worldwide instantly from konus and are of importance in the subsequent positioning of telescopes everywhere thus the instrument remains an active contributor to the astrophysical community for instance with the swift mission the tgrs instrument was shut off early in the mission due to the planned expiration of coolant the two gamma-ray instruments konus and tgrs on board of wind are described on their wind epact edit the energetic particles acceleration composition and transport epact 9 investigation consists of multiple telescopes

composed of three separate instruments suprathermal ion composition spectrometer stics high-resolution mass spectrometer mass and solar wind ion composition spectrometer swics stics determines the mass mass per charge and energy for ions in the energy range of 6 230 kev e mass determines elemental and isotopic abundances from 0.5 to 12 kev e swics determines mass charge and energy for ions in
