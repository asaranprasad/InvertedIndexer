yunnan and guangxi and in january established a government in the city for the third time flag of the ruling kuomintang from 1923 to 1926 sun and the kuomintang used the city as a base to prosecute a renewed revolution in china by conquering the warlords in the north although sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city with the leadership of chiang kai-shek the kmt developed its own military power that served its ambition the canton years saw the evolution of the kmt into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment

armed force staffed by communist commissars training its cadres in the whampoa military academy 97 in august the fledgling army suppressed the canton merchants corps uprising the next year the anti-imperialist may thirtieth movement swept the country and the kmt government called for strikes in canton and hong kong the tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the shakee massacre after the death of sun yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists in august the left-wing kmt leader liao zhongkai was assassinated and the right-wing leader hu hanmin the suspected mastermind was exiled to the soviet union leaving the pro-communist wang jingwei in charge opposing communist encroachment the right-wing western hills group vowed to expel the

soviet advisors 98 99 by may he had ended civilian control of the military 99 and begun his northern expedition against the warlords of the north its success led to the split of the kmt and the subsequent purge of the communists in the shanghai massacre when zhang fakui took guangzhou from the new guangxi clique as part of the infighting in 1927 the communists saw an opening and launched the guangzhou uprising but the rebel army units and armed workers were defeated after heavy fighting in the city by 1929 chen jitang had established himself as the military ruler of guangdong in 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-chiang schism which established a separate nationalist government in guangzhou 100 the separatists included prominent kmt leaders like wang jingwei sun fo and others

city s boat people to life on land since the 1980s the city s close proximity to hong kong and shenzhen and its ties to overseas chinese have made it one of the first beneficiaries of china s opening up under deng xiaoping beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city s industrialisation and development the municipality was expanded in the year 2000 with huadu and panyu joining the city as urban districts and conghua and zengcheng as more rural counties the former districts of dongshan and fangcun were abolished in 2005 merged into yuexiu and liwan respectively the city acquired
