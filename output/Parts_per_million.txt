diluted from 1 10,000 parts-per-million in science and engineering the parts-per notation is a set of pseudo-units to describe small values of miscellaneous dimensionless quantities e g mole fraction or mass fraction since these fractions are quantity-per-quantity measures they are pure numbers with no associated units of measurement commonly used are ppm parts-per-million 10 6 ppb parts-per-billion 10 9 ppt parts-per-trillion 10 12 and ppq parts-per-quadrillion 10 15 this notation is not part of the si system and its meaning is ambiguous contents 1 overview 1.1 in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy 2 parts-per expressions 3 criticism 3.1 long and short scales 3.2 thousand vs trillion 3.3 mass fraction vs mole fraction vs volume fraction 4 si-compliant expressions 5 uno 6 improper applications 7 see also 8 references 9 external links overview edit parts-per notation is often used describing dilute solutions in chemistry for instance the relative abundance of dissolved minerals or pollutants in water the unit 1 ppm can be used for a mass fraction if a water-borne pollutant is present at one-millionth of a gram per gram of sample solution when working with aqueous solutions it is common to assume that the density of water is 1.00 g ml therefore it is common to equate 1 kilogram of water with 1 l of water consequently 1 ppm corresponds to 1 mg l and 1 ppb corresponds to 1 g l similarly parts-per notation is used also in physics and engineering to express the value of various proportional phenomena for instance a special metal alloy might expand 1.2 micrometers per meter of length for every degree celsius and this would be expressed as 1.2 ppm c parts-per notation is also employed to denote the change stability or uncertainty in measurements for instance the accuracy of land-survey distance measurements when using a laser rangefinder might be 1 millimeter per kilometer of distance this could be expressed as accuracy 1 ppm 1 parts-per notations are all dimensionless quantities in mathematical expressions the units of measurement always cancel in fractions like 2 nanometers per meter 2 n m m 2 nano 2 10 9 2 ppb 2 0.000000001 so the quotients are pure-number coefficients with positive values less than 1 when parts-per notations including the percent symbol are used in regular prose as opposed to mathematical expressions they are still pure-number dimensionless quantities however they generally take the literal parts per meaning of a comparative ratio e g 2 ppb would generally be interpreted as two parts in a billion parts 2 parts-per notations may be expressed in terms of any unit of the same measure for instance the coefficient of thermal expansion of a certain brass alloy 18.7 ppm c may be expressed as 18.7 m m c or as 18.7 in in c the numeric value representing a relative proportion does not change with the adoption of a different unit of measure 3 similarly a metering pump that injects a trace chemical into the main process line at the proportional flow rate qp 125 ppm is doing so at a rate that may be expressed in a variety of volumetric units including 125 l l 125 gal gal 125 cm3 m3 etc in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy edit in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr chemical shift is usually expressed in ppm it represents the difference of a measured frequency in parts per million from the reference frequency the reference frequency depends on the instrument s magnetic field and the element being measured it is usually expressed in mhz typical chemical shifts are rarely more than a few hundred hz from the reference frequency so chemical shifts are conveniently expressed in ppm hz mhz parts-per notation gives a dimensionless quantity that does not depend on the instrument s field strength parts-per expressions edit visualisation of 1 1 1 and 1 ppm as the fraction of the red cube to its respective block one part per hundred is generally represented by the percent symbol and denotes one part per 100 parts one part in 102 and a value of 1 10 2 this is equivalent to about fifteen minutes out of one day one part per thousand should generally be spelled out in full and not as ppt which is usually understood to represent parts per trillion it may also be denoted by the millage symbol note however that specific disciplines such as oceanography as well as educational exercises do use the ppt abbreviation one part per thousand denotes one part per 1000 parts one part in 103 and a value of 1 10 3 this is equivalent to about one and a half minutes out of one day one part per ten thousand is denoted by the permyriad symbol in contrast in finance the basis point is a quantity with dimensions of time 1 and is typically used to denote changes in or differences between percentage interest rates for instance a change in an interest rate from 5.15 per annum to 5.35 per annum could be denoted as a change of 20 basis points although rarely used in science ppm is typically used instead one permyriad has an unambiguous value of one part per 7004100000000000000 10000 parts one part in 104 and a value of 1 10 4 this is equivalent to about nine seconds out of one day one part per million ppm denotes one part per 7006100000000000000 1000000 parts one part in 106 1 7006100000000000000 1000000 100 0.0001 or 1 7004100000000000000 10000 ppm and a value of 1 10 6 this is equivalent to about 32 seconds out of a year in distance measurement it is equivalent to 1 mm of error per km of distance traversed one part

12 this is equivalent to about three seconds out of every hundred thousand years one part per quadrillion ppq denotes one part per 7015100000000000000 1000000000000000 parts one part in 1015 and a value of 1 10 15 this is equivalent to about two and a half minutes out of the age of the earth 4.5 billion years although relatively uncommon in analytical chemistry measurements at the ppq level are sometimes performed 4 criticism edit although the international bureau of weights and measures an international standards organization known also by its french-language initials bipm recognizes the use of parts-per notation it is not formally part of the international system of units si 2 note that although percent is not formally part of the si both the bipm and the iso take the position that in mathematical expressions the internationally recognized symbol percent may be used with the si to represent the number 0.01 for dimensionless quantities 2 5 according to iupap a continued source of annoyance to unit purists has been the continued use of percent ppm ppb and ppt 6 although si-compliant expressions should be used as an alternative the parts-per notation remains nevertheless widely used in technical disciplines the main problems with the parts-per notation are the following long and short scales edit because the named numbers starting with a billion have different values in different countries the bipm suggests avoiding the use of ppb and ppt to prevent misunderstanding the u s national institute of standards and technology nist takes the stringent position stating that the language-dependent terms are not acceptable for use with the si to express the values of quantities 7 thousand vs trillion edit although ppt usually means parts per trillion it occasionally means parts per thousand unless the meaning of ppt is defined explicitly it has to be determined from the context mass fraction vs mole fraction vs volume fraction edit another problem of the parts-per notation is that it may refer to mass fraction mole fraction or volume fraction since it is usually not stated which quantity is used it is better to write the unit as kg kg mol mol or m3 m3 even though they are all dimensionless 8 the difference is quite significant when dealing with gases and it is very important to specify which quantity is being used for example the conversion factor between a mass fraction of 1 ppb and a mole fraction of 1 ppb is about 4.7 for the greenhouse gas cfc-11 in air for volume fraction the suffix v or v is sometimes appended to the parts-per notation e g ppmv ppbv pptv 9 10 unfortunately ppbv and pptv are also often used for mole fractions which is identical to volume fraction only for ideal gases the usage is generally quite fixed inside most specific branches of science leading some researchers to draw the conclusion that their own usage mass mass mol mol volume volume or others is the only correct one this in turn leads them to not specify their usage in their publications and others may therefore misinterpret their results for example electrochemists often use volume volume while chemical engineers may use mass mass as well as volume volume many academic papers of otherwise excellent level fail to specify their usage of the parts-per notation si-compliant expressions edit si-compliant units that can be used as alternatives are shown in the chart below expressions that the bipm explicitly does not recognize as being suitable for denoting dimensionless quantities with the si are shown in red text notations for

out in expressions like 1 nm m 1 n m m 1 nano 1 10 9 so the quotients are pure-number coefficients with values less than 1 uno edit because of the cumbersome nature of expressing certain dimensionless quantities per si guidelines the international union of pure and applied physics iupap in 1999 proposed the adoption of the special name uno symbol u to represent the number 1 in dimensionless quantities 6 this symbol is not to be confused with the always-italicized symbol for the variable uncertainty symbol u this unit name uno and its symbol could be used in combination with the si prefixes to express the values of dimensionless quantities that are much less or even greater than one 12 common parts-per notations in terms of the uno are given in the table below iupap s uno

that response to the proposal of the uno had been almost entirely negative and the principal proponent recommended dropping the idea 13 to date the uno has not been adopted by any standards organization and it appears unlikely it will ever become an officially sanctioned way to express low-value high-ratio dimensionless quantities the proposal was instructive however as to the perceived shortcomings of the current options for denoting dimensionless quantities improper applications edit parts-per notation may properly be used only to express true dimensionless quantities that is the units of measurement must cancel in expressions like 1 mg kg so that the quotients are pure numbers with values less than 1 mixed-unit quantities such as a radon concentration of 15 pci l are not dimensionless quantities and may not be expressed using any form of parts-per notation such as 15 ppt other examples of measures that are not dimensionless quantities are as follows particulate matter in the air 50 g m3 not 50 ppb a stepper motor gear system that produces a motion of 1 m pulse not 1 ppm mercury vapor concentration in air 0.6 ng l not 0.6 ppt note however that it is not uncommon to express aqueous concentrations particularly in drinking-water reports intended for the general public using parts-per notation 2.1 ppm 0.8 ppb etc and further for those reports to state that the notations denote milligrams per liter or micrograms per liter although 2.1 mg l is not a dimensionless quantity it is assumed in scientific circles that 2.1 mg kg 2.1 ppm is the true measure because one liter of water has a mass of about one kilogram the goal in all technical writing including drinking-water reports for the general public is to clearly communicate to the intended audience with minimal confusion drinking water is intuitively a volumetric quantity in the public s mind so measures of contamination expressed on a per-liter basis are considered to be easier to grasp still it is technically possible for example to dissolve more than one liter of a very hydrophilic chemical in 1 liter of water parts-per notation would be confusing when describing its solubility in water greater than a million parts per million so one would simply state the volume or mass that will dissolve into a liter instead when reporting air-borne rather than water-borne densities a slightly different convention is used since air is approximately 1000 times less dense than water in water 1 g m3 is roughly equivalent to parts-per-trillion whereas in air it is roughly equivalent to parts-per-billion note also that in the case of air this convention is much less accurate whereas one liter of water is almost exactly 1 kg one cubic meter of air is often taken as 1.143 kg much less accurate but still close enough for many practical uses citation needed see also edit international electrotechnical commission iec international organization for standardization iso international

permyriad basis point references edit this is a simplified explanation laser rangefinders typically have a measurement granularity of one to ten millimeters thus the complete specification for distance measurement accuracy might read as follows accuracy 1 mm 1 ppm consequently a distance measurement of only a few meters would still have an accuracy of 1 mm in this example a b c bipm in the particular case of coefficient of thermal expansion the change to inches one of the u s customary units is typically also accompanied by a change to degrees fahrenheit since a fahrenheit-sized interval of temperature is only 5 9 that of a celsius-sized interval the value is typically expressed as 10.4 in in f rather than 18.7 in in c measurements of dioxin are routinely made at the sub-ppq level the u s environmental protection agency epa currently sets a hard limit of 30 ppq for dioxin in drinking water but once recommended a voluntary limit of 0.013 ppq also radioactive contaminants in drinking water which are quantified by measuring their radiation are often reported in terms of ppq 0.013 ppq is equivalent to the thickness of a sheet of paper versus a journey of
