gm over r 2 mathbf hat r where m displaystyle m is the mass of the larger body and r displaystyle mathbf hat r is a unit vector directed from the large mass to the smaller mass the negative sign indicates that the force is an attractive force in that way the force acting upon the smaller mass can be calculated as f m g displaystyle mathbf f m mathbf g where f displaystyle mathbf f is the force vector m displaystyle m is the smaller mass and g displaystyle mathbf g is a vector pointing toward the larger body note that g displaystyle mathbf g has units of acceleration and is a vector function of location relative to the large body independent of the magnitude or even the presence of the smaller mass this model represents the far-field gravitational acceleration associated with a massive body when the dimensions of a body are not trivial compared to the distances of interest the principle of superposition can be used for differential masses for an assumed density distribution throughout the body in order to get a more detailed model of the near-field gravitational acceleration for satellites in orbit the far-field model is sufficient for rough calculations of altitude versus period but not for precision estimation of future location after multiple orbits the more detailed models include among other things the bulging at the equator for the earth and irregular mass concentrations due to meteor impacts for the moon the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission launched in 2002 consists of two probes nicknamed tom and jerry in polar orbit around the earth measuring differences in the distance between the two probes in order to more precisely determine the gravitational field around the earth and to track changes that occur over time similarly the gravity recovery and interior laboratory grail mission from 2011-2012 consisted of two probes ebb and flow in polar orbit around the moon to more precisely determine the gravitational field for future navigational purposes and to infer information about the moon s physical makeup gravity model for earth edit the type of gravity model used for the earth depends upon the degree of fidelity required for a given problem for many problems such as aircraft simulation it may be sufficient to consider gravity to be a constant defined as 4 g displaystyle g 9.80655 metres 32.1737 ft per s 2 based upon data from world geodetic system 1984 wgs-84 where g displaystyle g is understood to be pointing down in the local frame of reference if it is desirable to model an object s weight on earth as a function of latitude one could use the following 4 p 41 g g 45 1 2 g p o l e s g e q u a t o r cos 2 l a t 180 displaystyle g g 45 -

gm over r 2 mathbf hat r where m is the mass of the attracting object r displaystyle scriptstyle mathbf hat r is the unit vector from center-of-mass of the attracting object to the center-of-mass of the object being accelerated r is the distance between the two objects and g is the gravitational constant when this calculation is done for objects on the surface of the earth or aircraft that rotate with the earth one has to account for the fact that the earth is rotating and the centrifugal acceleration has to be subtracted from this for example the equation above gives the acceleration at 9.820 m s2 when gm 3.986 1014 m3 s2 and r 6.371 106 m the centripetal radius is r r cos latitude and the centripetal time unit is approximately day 2 reduces this for r 5 106 metres to 9.79379 m s2 which is closer to the observed value general relativity edit in einstein s theory of general relativity gravitation is an attribute of curved spacetime instead of being due to a force propagated between bodies in einstein s theory masses distort spacetime in their vicinity and other particles move in trajectories determined by the geometry of spacetime the gravitational force is a fictitious force there is no gravitational acceleration in that the proper acceleration and hence four-acceleration of objects in free fall are zero rather than undergoing an acceleration objects in free fall travel along straight lines geodesics on the curved spacetime see also edit air track gravimetry gravity of earth newton s law of universal gravitation standard gravity references edit gerald james holton and stephen g brush 2001 3rd ed rutgers university press p 113 isbn 978-0-8135-2908-0 hirt c claessens s fecher t kuhn m pail r rexer m 2013 new ultrahigh-resolution picture of earth s gravity field geophysical research letters 40 16 4279 4283 bibcode doi fredrick j bueche 1975 introduction to physics for scientists and engineers 2nd ed usa von hoffmann press isbn 0-07-008836-5 a b c d brian l stevens frank l lewis 2003 aircraft control and simulation 2nd ed hoboken new jersey john wiley sons inc isbn 0-471-37145-9 richard b noll michael b mcelroy 1974 models of mars atmosphere 1974 greenbelt maryland nasa goddard space flight center sp-8010 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title gravitational acceleration oldid 823559947 categories gravimetry gravitation acceleration hidden categories articles needing additional references from december 2010 all articles needing additional references navigation menu search this page was last edited on 2 february 2018 at 00 17 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
