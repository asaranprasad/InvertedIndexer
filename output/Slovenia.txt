appeared almost simultaneously in mesopotamia and europe 55 in the transition period between the bronze age to the iron age the urnfield culture flourished archaeological remains dating from the hallstatt period have been found particularly in southeastern slovenia among them a number of situlas in novo mesto the town of situlas 56 in the iron age present-day slovenia was inhabited by illyrian and celtic tribes until the 1st century bc roman era edit roman emona s south wall reconstruction in present-day ljubljana the area that is present-day slovenia was in roman times shared between venetia et histria region x of roman italia in the classification of augustus and the provinces pannonia and noricum the romans established posts at emona ljubljana poetovio ptuj and celeia celje and constructed trade and military roads that ran across slovene territory from italy to pannonia in the 5th and 6th centuries the area was subject to invasions by the huns and germanic tribes during their incursions into italy a part of the inner state was protected with a defensive line of towers and walls called claustra alpium iuliarum a crucial battle between theodosius i and eugenius took place in the vipava valley in 394 slavic settlement edit the slavic tribes migrated to the alpine area after the westward departure of the lombards the last germanic tribe in 568 and under pressure from avars established a slavic settlement in the eastern alps from 623 to 624 or possibly 626 onwards king samo united the alpine and western slavs against the avars and germanic peoples and established what is referred to as samo s kingdom after its disintegration following samo s death in 658 or 659 the ancestors of the slovenes located in present-day carinthia formed the independent duchy of carantania 57 and carniola later duchy carniola other parts of present-day slovenia were again ruled by avars before charlemagne s victory over them in 803 prince s stone symbol of duchy of carantania middle ages edit the carantanians one of the ancestral groups of the modern slovenes particularly the carinthian slovenes was the first slavic people to accept christianity they were mostly christianized by irish missionaries among them modestus known as the apostle of carantanians this process together with the christianization of the bavarians was later described in the memorandum known as the conversio bagoariorum et carantanorum which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the church of salzburg in the christianization process over similar efforts of the patriarchate of aquileia a depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of slovene-speaking tribes which took place on the prince s stone in slovene language until 1414 in the mid-8th century carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the bavarians who began spreading christianity three decades later the carantanians were incorporated together with the bavarians into the carolingian empire during the same period carniola too came under the franks and was christianised from aquileia following the anti-frankish rebellion of liudewit at the beginning of the 9th century the franks removed the carantanian princes replacing them with their own border dukes consequently the frankish feudal system reached the slovene territory after the victory of emperor otto i over the magyars in 955 slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the holy roman empire carantania being the most important was elevated into the duchy of carinthia in 976 by the 11th century the germanization of what is now lower austria effectively isolated the slovene-inhabited territory from the other western slavs speeding up the development of the slavs of carantania and of carniola into an independent carantanian carniolans slovene ethnic group by the late middle ages the historic provinces of carniola styria carinthia gorizia trieste and istria developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval german state the consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries and were led by a number of important feudal families such as the dukes of spannheim the counts of gorizia the counts of celje and finally the house of habsburg in a parallel process an intensive german colonization significantly diminished the extent of slovene-speaking areas by the 15th century the slovene ethnic territory was reduced to its present size 58 in the 14th century most of the territory of present-day slovenia was taken over by the habsburgs the hungarian clan z h administering the territories connecting slovenia with slovakia and moravia was exterminated in 1330 and the slovenes permanently lost the connection with their slovak kinsmen the counts of celje a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes were habsburgs powerful competitors for some time this large dynasty important at a european political level had its seat in slovene territory but died out in 1456 its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the habsburgs who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century patria del friuli ruled present western slovenia until venetian takeover in 1420 the ottoman army battling the habsburgs in present-day slovenia during the great turkish war at the end of the middle ages the slovene lands suffered a serious economic and demographic setback because of the turkish raids in 1515 a peasant revolt spread across nearly the whole slovene territory in 1572 and 1573 the croatian-slovenian peasant revolt wrought havoc throughout the wider region such uprisings which often met with bloody defeats continued throughout the 17th century 58 early modern period edit the republic of venice was dissolved by france and venetian slovenia was passed to the austrian empire in 1797 the slovene lands were part of the french-administered illyrian provinces the austrian empire and austria-hungary slovenes inhabited most of carniola the southern part of the duchies of carinthia and styria the northern and eastern areas of the austrian littoral as well as prekmurje in the kingdom of hungary 59 industrialization was accompanied by construction of railroads to link cities and markets but the urbanization was limited due to limited opportunities between 1880 and 1910 there was extensive emigration and around 300,000 slovenes i e 1 in 6 emigrated to other countries 60 mostly to the us but also to south america the main part to argentina germany egypt and to larger cities in austria-hungary especially vienna and graz the area of the united states with the highest concentration of slovenian immigrants is cleveland ohio the other locations in the united states where many slovenians settled were areas with substantial industrial and mining activities pittsburgh chicago pueblo butte and the salt lake valley the men were important as workers in the mining industry because of some of the skills they brought from slovenia despite this the slovene population increased significantly 60 literacy was exceptionally high at 80 90 60 the 19th century also saw a revival of culture in the slovene language accompanied by a romantic nationalist quest for cultural and political autonomy the idea of a united slovenia first advanced during the revolutions of 1848 became the common platform of most slovenian parties and political movements in austria-hungary during the same period yugoslavism an ideology stressing the unity of all south slavic peoples spread as a reaction to pan-german nationalism and italian irredentism world war i edit the battles of the isonzo took place mostly in rugged mountainous areas above the so a river world war i brought heavy casualties to slovenes particularly the twelve battles of the isonzo which took place in present-day slovenia s western border area hundreds of thousands of slovene conscripts were drafted into the austro-hungarian army and over 30,000 of them died hundreds of thousands of slovenes from gorizia and gradisca were resettled in refugee camps in italy and austria while the refugees in austria received decent treatment the slovene refugees in italian camps were treated as state enemies and several thousand died of malnutrition and diseases between 1915 and 1918 61 entire areas of the slovene littoral were destroyed the treaty of rapallo of 1920 left approximately 327,000 out of the total population of 1.3 million slovenes in italy 62 63 after the fascists took power in italy they were subjected to a policy of violent fascist italianization this caused the mass emigration of slovenes especially the middle class from the slovenian littoral and trieste to yugoslavia and south america those who remained organized several connected networks of both passive and armed resistance the best known was the militant anti-fascist organization tigr formed in 1927 in order to fight fascist oppression of the slovene and croat populations in the julian march 64 65 kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes later the kingdom of yugoslavia edit the proclamation of the state of slovenes croats and serbs at congress square in ljubljana on 20 october 1918 the slovene people s party launched a movement for self-determination demanding the creation of a semi-independent south slavic state under habsburg rule the proposal was picked up by most slovene parties and a mass mobilization of slovene civil society known as the declaration movement followed 66 this demand was rejected by the austrian political elites but following the dissolution of the austro-hungarian empire in the aftermath of the first world war the national council of slovenes croats and serbs took power in zagreb on 6 october 1918 on 29 october independence was declared by a national gathering in ljubljana and by the croatian parliament declaring the establishment of the new state of slovenes croats and serbs the map showing the present territory of slovenia with traditional regional boundaries the slovene-speaking areas annexed by italy after wwi are shown in stripes on 1 december 1918 the state of slovenes croats and serbs merged with serbia becoming part of the new kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes in 1929 it was renamed the kingdom of yugoslavia the main territory of slovenia being the most industrialized and westernized compared to other less developed parts of yugoslavia became the main center of industrial production compared to serbia for example slovenian industrial production was four times greater and it was 22 times greater than in macedonia the interwar period brought further industrialization in slovenia with rapid economic growth in the 1920s followed by a relatively successful economic adjustment to the 1929 economic crisis and great depression following a plebiscite in october 1920 the slovene-speaking southern carinthia was ceded to austria with the treaty of trianon on the other hand the kingdom of yugoslavia was awarded the slovene-inhabited prekmurje region formerly part of austro-hungary slovenes living in territories that fell under the rule of the neighboring states italy austria and hungary were subjected to assimilation world war ii edit slovenia was the only present-day european nation that was trisected and completely annexed into both nazi germany and fascist italy during world war ii 67 in addition the prekmurje region in the east was annexed to hungary and some villages in the lower sava valley were incorporated in the newly created nazi puppet independent state of croatia ndh adolf hitler and martin bormann visiting maribor in april 1941 axis forces invaded yugoslavia in april 1941 and defeated the country in a few weeks the southern part including ljubljana was annexed to italy while the nazis took over the northern and eastern parts of the country the nazis had a plan of ethnic cleansing of these areas 68 and they resettled or expelled the local slovene civilian population to the puppet states of nedi s serbia 7,500 and ndh 10,000 in addition some 46,000 slovenes were expelled to germany including children who were separated from their parents and allocated to german families 69 70 at the same time the ethnic germans in the gottschee enclave in the italian annexation zone were resettled to the nazi-controlled areas cleansed of their slovene population 71 around 30,000 to 40,000 slovene men were drafted to the german army and sent to the eastern front the slovene language was banned from education and its use in the public life was limited to the absolute minimum 67 in south-central slovenia annexed by fascist italy and renamed to province of ljubljana the slovenian national liberation front was organized in april 1941 led by the communist party it formed the slovene partisan units as part of the yugoslav partisans led by the communist leader josip broz tito 72 73 partisans fighting for trieste and primorje region 1945 after the resistance started in summer 1941 italian violence against the slovene civilian population escalated as well the italian authorities deported some 25,000 people to the concentration camps which equaled 7.5 of the population of their occupation zone the most infamous ones were rab and gonars to counter the communist-led insurgence the italians sponsored local anti-guerrilla units formed mostly by the local conservative catholic slovene population that resented the revolutionary violence of the partisans after the italian armistice of september 1943 the germans took over both the province of ljubljana and the slovenian littoral incorporating them into what was known as the operation zone of adriatic coastal region they united the slovene anti-communist counter-insurgence into the slovene home guard and appointed a puppet regime in the province of ljubljana the anti-nazi resistance however expanded creating its own administrative structures as the basis for slovene statehood within a new federal and socialist yugoslavia 74 75 in 1945 yugoslavia was liberated by the partisan resistance and soon became a socialist federation known as the people s federal republic of yugoslavia slovenia joined the federation as a constituent republic led by its own pro-communist leadership approximately 8 of the entire slovene population died during world war ii the small jewish community mostly settled in the prekmurje region perished in 1944 in the holocaust of hungarian jews the german speaking minority amounting to 2.5 of the slovenian population prior to wwii was either expelled or killed in the aftermath of the war hundreds of istrian italians and slovenes that opposed communism were killed in the foibe massacres and more than 25,000 fled or were expelled from slovenian istria in the aftermath of the war 76 socialist period edit location of slovenia within socialist federal republic of yugoslavia following the re-establishment of yugoslavia during world war ii slovenia became part of federal yugoslavia a socialist state was established but because of the tito stalin split in 1948 economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the rest of the eastern bloc in 1947 the slovene littoral and the western half of inner carniola which had been annexed by italy after world war one were annexed to slovenia after the failure of forced collectivisation that was attempted from 1949 53 a policy of gradual economic liberalisation known as workers self-management was introduced under the advice and supervision of the slovene marxist theoretician and communist leader edvard kardelj the main ideologue of the titoist path to socialism suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to the goli otok josip broz tito led sfr yugoslavia from 1944 to 1980 pictured tito with the us president richard nixon in the white house 1971 the late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere as well and limited border crossing into neighboring italy and austria was allowed again until the 1980s slovenia enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation in 1956 josip broz tito together with other leaders founded the non-aligned movement particularly in the 1950s slovenia s economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised with further economic decentralisation of yugoslavia in 1965 66 slovenia s domestic product was 2.5 times the average of yugoslav republics opposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles and became especially vocal after tito s death in 1980 when the economic and political situation in yugoslavia became very strained 58 political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment as many slovenians felt they were being economically exploited having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration slovenian spring democracy and independence edit in 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded slovene independence in the 57th edition of the magazine nova revija demands for democratisation and more slovenian independence were sparked off a mass democratic movement coordinated by the committee for the defence of human rights pushed the communists in the direction of democratic reforms in september 1989 numerous constitutional amendments were passed to introduce parliamentary democracy to slovenia 77 78 the same year action north united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in slovenia as the first defense action against attacks by slobodan milo evi s supporters leading to slovenian independence 79 80 need quotation to verify on 7 march 1990 the slovenian assembly changed the official name of the state to the republic of slovenia 81 82 in april 1990 the first democratic election in slovenia took place and the united opposition movement demos led by jo e pu nik emerged victorious slovenian forces attacking a yugoslav army tank during the ten-day war 1991 the initial revolutionary events in slovenia pre-dated the revolutions of 1989 in eastern europe by almost a year but went largely unnoticed by international observers on 23 december 1990 more than 88 of the electorate voted for a sovereign and independent slovenia 83 84 on 25 june 1991 slovenia became independent 5 through the passage of appropriate legal documents 85 on 27 june in the early morning the yugoslav people s army dispatched its forces to prevent further measures for the establishment of a new country which led to the ten-day war 86 87 on 7 july the brijuni agreement was signed implementing a truce and a three-month halt of the enforcement of slovenia s independence 88 in the end of the month the last soldiers of the yugoslav army left slovenia in december 1991 a new constitution was adopted 85 followed in 1992 by the laws on denationalisation and privatization 89 the members of the european union recognised slovenia as an independent state on 15 january 1992 and the united nations accepted it as a member on 22 may 1992 90 slovenia joined the european union on 1 may 2004 slovenia has one commissioner in the european commission and seven slovene parliamentarians were elected to the european parliament at elections on 13 june 2004 in 2004 slovenia also joined nato slovenia subsequently succeeded in meeting the maastricht criteria and joined the eurozone the first transition country to do so on 1 january 2007 it was the first post-communist country to hold the presidency of the council of the european union for the first six months of 2008 on 21 july 2010 it became a member of the oecd 91 the disillusionment with domestic socio-economic elites at municipal and national levels was expressed at the 2012 2013 slovenian protests on a wider scale than in the smaller 15 october 2011 protests 92 in relation to the leading politicians response to allegations made by the official commission for the prevention of corruption of the republic of slovenia legal experts expressed the need for changes in the system that would limit political arbitrariness 93 context needed geography edit a topographic map of slovenia mount triglav slovenia is situated in central and southeastern europe touching the alps and bordering the mediterranean it lies between latitudes 45 and 47 n and longitudes 13 and 17 e the 15th meridian east almost corresponds to the middle line of the country in the direction west-east 94 the geometrical center of the republic of slovenia is located at coordinates 46 07 11.8 n and 14 48 55.2 e 95 it lies in slivna in the municipality of litija 96 slovenia s highest peak is triglav 2,864 m or 9,396 ft the country s average height above sea level is 557 m 1,827 ft four major european geographic regions meet in slovenia the alps the dinarides the pannonian plain and the mediterranean although on the shore of the adriatic sea near the mediterranean sea most of slovenia is in the black sea drainage basin the alps including the julian alps the kamnik-savinja alps and the karavanke chain as well as the pohorje massif dominate northern slovenia along its long border with austria slovenia s adriatic coastline stretches approximately 47 kilometres 29 mi 97 from italy to croatia the term karst topography refers to that of southwestern slovenia s karst plateau a limestone region of underground rivers gorges and caves between ljubljana and the mediterranean on the pannonian plain to the east and northeast toward the croatian and hungarian borders the landscape is essentially flat however the majority of slovenian terrain is hilly or mountainous with around 90 of the surface 200 m 656 ft or more above sea level over half of the country 11,823 km2 or 4,565 sq mi is covered by forests 98 this makes slovenia the third most forested country in europe after finland and sweden the areas are covered mostly by beech fir-beech and beech-oak forests and have a relatively high production capacity 99 remnants of primeval forests are still to be found the largest in the ko evje area grassland covers 5,593 km2 2,159 sq mi and fields and gardens 954 km2 or 368 sq mi there are 363 km2 140 sq mi of orchards and 216 km2 83 sq mi of vineyards geology edit solution runnels also known as rillenkarren are a karst feature on the karst plateau as in many other karst areas of the world slovenia is in a rather active seismic zone because of its position on the small adriatic plate which is squeezed between the eurasian plate to the north and the african plate to the south and rotates counter-clockwise 100 thus the country is at the junction of three important geotectonic units the alps to the north the dinaric alps to the south and the pannonian basin to the east 100 scientists have been able to identify 60 destructive earthquakes in the past additionally a network of seismic stations is active throughout the country 100 many parts of slovenia have a carbonate ground and an extensive subterranean system has developed natural regions edit the first regionalisations of slovenia were made by geographers anton melik 1935 1936 and svetozar ile i 1968 the newer regionalisation by ivan gams divided slovenia in the following macroregions 101 the alps alpe the subalpine landscapes predalpski svet the slovene littoral or submediterranean slovenia primorje or submediteranska slovenija the dinaric plateaus of the continental slovenia dinarske planote celinske slovenije subpannonian slovenia subpanonska slovenija according to a newer natural geographic regionalisation the country consists of four macroregions these are the alpine the mediterranean the dinaric and the pannonian landscapes macroregions are defined according to major relief units the alps the pannonian plain the dinaric mountains and climate types submediterranean temperate continental mountain climate 102 these are often quite interwoven protected areas of slovenia include national parks regional parks and nature parks the largest of which is triglav national park there are 286 natura 2000 designated protected areas which comprise 36 of the country s land area the largest percentage among european union states 103 additionally according to yale university s environmental performance index slovenia is considered a strong performer in environmental protection efforts 104 slovenian coast with cliffs submediterranean slovenia vineyards in the gorizia hills dinaric slovenia intermittent lake cerknica alpine landscape view of lake jasna near kranjska gora with

northwestern slovenia as seen from the top of mangart in september 2007 climate types slovenia 1970 2000 and climograms for selected settlements slovenia is located in temperate latitudes the climate is also influenced by the variety of relief and the influence of the alps and the adriatic sea in the northeast the continental climate type with greatest difference between winter and summer temperatures prevails in the coastal region there is sub-mediterranean climate the effect of the sea on the temperature rates is visible also up the so a valley while a severe alpine climate is present in the high mountain regions there is a strong interaction between these three climatic systems across most of the country 105 106 precipitation often coming from bay of genoa 107 varies across the country as well with over 3,500 mm 138 in in some western regions and dropping down to 800 mm 31 in in prekmurje snow is quite frequent in winter and the record snow cover in ljubljana was recorded in 1952 at 146 cm 57 in compared to western europe slovenia is not very windy because it lies in the slipstream of the alps the average wind speeds are lower than in the plains of the nearby countries due to the rugged terrain local vertical winds with daily periods are present besides these there are three winds of particular regional importance the bora the jugo and the foehn the jugo and the bora are characteristic of the littoral whereas the jugo is humid and warm the bora is usually cold and gusty the foehn is typical of the alpine regions in the north of slovenia generally present in slovenia are the northeast wind the southeast wind and the north wind 108 waters edit the so a river flows through triglav national park lake bohinj largest slovenian lake one of the two springs of the sava river the territory of slovenia mainly 16,423 square kilometers or 6,341 square miles i e 81 belongs to the black sea basin and a smaller part 3,850 square kilometers or 1,490 square miles i e 19 belongs to the adriatic sea basin these two parts are divided into smaller units in regard to their central rivers the mura river basin the drava river basin the sava river basin with kolpa river basin and the basin of the adriatic rivers 109 in comparison with developed countries water quality in slovenia is considered to be among the highest in europe one of the reasons is undoubtedly that most of the rivers rise on the mountainous territory of slovenia but this does not mean that slovenia has no problems with surface water and groundwater quality especially in areas
