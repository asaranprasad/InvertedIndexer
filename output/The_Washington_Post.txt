newspaper consolidated its position by acquiring and merging with its last morning rival the washington times-herald 30 the combined paper was officially named the washington post and times-herald until 1973 although the times-herald portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent after the 1950s the merger left the post with two remaining local competitors the afternoon washington star evening star and the washington daily news which merged in 1972 and folded in 1981 31 32 the washington times established in 1982 by unification church leader sun myung moon 1920 2012 under his company news world communications has been a local conservative rival with a circulation as of 2005 about one-seventh that of the post 33 in the late 2000s additional editorially conservative competition increased with the foundation of the tabloid-format daily the washington examiner by the new owners of the old hearst paper the san francisco examiner who engineered a swap trading the larger more prosperous san francisco chronicle for the former hearst flagship paper they also started several other tabloid-format examiners in several american cities including briefly for two years

1993 she retained a position as chairman of the executive committee until her death in 2001 her tenure is credited with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting after it began to live down its reputation as a house organ for the kennedy and johnson administration working to ensure that the new york times did not surpass its washington reporting of the pentagon papers and watergate scandal graham took the washington post company public on june 15 1971 in the midst of the pentagon papers controversy a total of 1,294,000 shares were offered to the public at 26 per share 34 35 by the end of graham s tenure as ceo in 1991 the stock was worth 888 per share not counting the effect of an intermediate 4 1 stock split 36 during this time katharine graham also oversaw the post company s diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company kaplan inc for 40 million in 1984 37 twenty years later kaplan had surpassed the post newspaper as the company s leading contributor to income and by 2010 kaplan accounted for more than 60 of the entire company revenue stream 38 executive editor ben bradlee a kennedy loyalist put the newspaper s reputation and resources behind reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein who in a long series of articles chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of democratic national committee offices in the watergate hotel complex in washington the post s dogged coverage of the story the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of president richard nixon won the newspaper a pulitzer prize in 1973 in 1972 the book world section was introduced with pulitzer prize winning critic william mcpherson as its first editor 39 it featured pulitzer prize winning critics such as jonathan yardley and michael dirda the latter of whom established his career as a critic at the post in 2009 after 37 years with great reader outcries and protest the washington post book world as a standalone insert was discontinued the last issue being sunday february 15 2009 40 along with a general reorganization of the paper such as placing the sunday editorials on the back page of the main front section rather than the outlook section and distributing some other locally oriented op-ed letters and commentaries in other sections 41 however book reviews are still published in the outlook section on sundays and in the style section the rest of the week as well as online 41 in 1980 the newspaper published a dramatic story called jimmy s world 42 describing the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict in washington for which reporter janet cooke won acclaim and a pulitzer prize subsequent investigation however revealed the story to be a fabrication the pulitzer prize was returned donald e graham katharine s son succeeded her as publisher in 1979 and in the early 1990s became both chief executive officer and chairman of the board he was succeeded in 2000 as

the company leased 242,000 square feet 22,500 m2 of space for 16 years on floors four through nine in the west tower and floors seven and eight in the east tower the building s owner agreed to an extensive build-out only about 10 percent of the space will be private offices which required extensive demolition of interior walls and the removal of the walls on the seventh and eighth floor in the east tower so they joined with the floors on the west tower the newly joined space will create two 60,000-square-foot 5,600 m2 floors capable of accommodating 700 newsroom workers and software engineers the build-out includes four sets for live television filming a new staircase between the seventh and eighth floors in each tower and a two-story auditorium on the fourth floor the building s south-facing facade will also be altered to give post workers floor-to-ceiling windows 51 political stance edit 1970 2000 edit in the mid-1970s some conservatives called the newspaper pravda on the potomac because of its perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials 52 since then the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper 53 54 in 1963 fbi director j edgar hoover reportedly told president lyndon b johnson i don t have much influence with the post because i frankly don t read it i view it like the daily worker 55 56 2000 present edit on march 26 2007 chris matthews said on his television program well the washington post is not the liberal newspaper it was congressman let me tell you i have been reading it for years and it is a neocon newspaper 57 it has regularly published an ideological mixture of op-ed columnists some of them left-leaning including e j dionne dana milbank greg sargent and eugene robinson and many on the right including george will marc thiessen michael gerson and charles krauthammer in a study published on april 18 2007 by yale professors alan gerber dean karlan and daniel bergan citizens were given a subscription to either the conservative-leaning washington times or the liberal-leaning washington post to see the effect that media has on voting patterns gerber had estimated based on his work that the post slanted as much to the left as the times did to the right gerber found those who were given a free subscription of the post were 7.9 11.4 more likely to vote for the democratic candidate for governor than those assigned to the control group depending on the adjustment for the date on which individual participants were surveyed and the survey interviewer surprisingly however people who received the times were also more likely than controls to vote for the democrat with an effect approximately 60 as large as that estimated for the post 58 59 the study authors noted that sampling error might have played a role in the effect of the conservative-leaning times as might the fact that the democratic candidate took more conservative-leaning positions than is typical for his party and that the month prior to the post-election survey was a difficult period for president bush one in which his overall approval rating fell by approximately 4 percentage points nationwide it appears that heightened exposure to both papers news coverage despite opposing ideological slants moved public opinion away from republicans 59 in november 2007 the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist robert parry for reporting on anti-obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims 60 in 2009 parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians including vice president al gore and president barack obama 61 responding to criticism of the newspaper s coverage during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election former post ombudsman deborah howell wrote the opinion pages have strong conservative voices the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives and there were editorials critical of obama yet opinion was still weighted toward obama 62 according to a 2009 oxford university press book by richard davis on the impact of blogs on american politics liberal bloggers link to the washington post and the new york times more often than other major newspapers however conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers 63 in mid-september 2016 matthew ingram of forbes joined glenn greenwald of the intercept and trevor trimm of the guardian in cricitizing the washington post for demanding that former national security agency contractor edward snowden stand trial on espionage charges 64 65 66 67 in december 2016 the post published a story inaccurately stating that a russian hacking operation had infiltrated the u s electrical grid the claim was retracted in a revised version of the story after the initial version had been widely circulated 68 69 in february 2017 amid a barrage of criticism from president donald trump over the paper s coverage of his campaign and early presidency as well as concerns among the american press about trump s criticism and threats against journalists who provide coverage he deems unfavorable the post adopted the slogan democracy dies in darkness 70 political endorsements edit katharine graham wrote in her autobiography personal history that the newspaper long had a policy of not making endorsements for political candidates however since at least 2000 the newspaper has occasionally endorsed republican politicians such as maryland governor robert ehrlich 71 in 2006 it repeated its historic endorsements of every republican incumbent for congress in northern virginia 72 there have also been times when the post has specifically chosen not to endorse any candidate such as in the 1988 presidential election when it refused to endorse then-governor michael dukakis or then-vice president george h w bush 73 on october 17 2008 the post endorsed barack obama for president of the united states 74 on october 25 2012 the newspaper endorsed the re-election of barack obama 75 on october 21 2014 the newspaper endorsed 44 democratic candidates versus 3 republican candidates for the 2014 elections in the district of columbia maryland and virginia 76 on october 13 2016 it endorsed hillary clinton for the presidential election of that year 77 the post s early endorsements in the 1978 elections for maryland governor reformist harry hughes and for d c mayor a young marion barry allowed those candidates to tout their endorsements thereby distinguishing them from an otherwise crowded field of big name candidates

invade iraq national security correspondent walter pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of republican administrations 79 according to author and journalist greg mitchell by the post s own admission in the months before the war it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war while contrary information got lost as one post staffer told kurtz 80 in november 2016 the post published a story that relied heavily on a report by propornot an anonymous internet group that seeks to expose what it calls russian propaganda propornot published a list of websites they called bona-fide useful idiots of the russian government 81 andrew cockburn washington editor for harper s was sharply critical of post s decision to put the story on its front page calling the article a sorry piece of trash 82 writers in the intercept fortune and rolling stone also criticized post for including a report by an organization with no reputation for fact-checking in an article on fake news 83 84 85 looking more carefully into their methodology adrian chen staff writer for the new yorker argued that propornot s criteria for establishing propaganda were so broad that they could have included not only russian state-controlled media organizations such as russia today but nearly every news outlet in the world including the post itself on their list 86 in 2017 the washington post was the target of two attempts to discredit the newspaper in relation to that year s us senate special election in alabama one involving a robocall from a fake
