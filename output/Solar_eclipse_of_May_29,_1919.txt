of the bending of light by the gravity of the sun one of the components of his general theory of relativity can be tested during a solar eclipse when stars with apparent position near the sun become visible following an unsuccessful attempt to validate this prediction during the solar eclipse of june 8 1918 2 two expeditions were made to measure positions of stars during this eclipse the first was led by sir frank watson dyson and sir arthur eddington to the island of principe off the west coast of africa the second by andrew claude de la cherois crommelin and charles davidson to sobral in brazil 3 the stars that both expeditions observed were in the constellation taurus 4 related eclipses edit solar eclipses 1916 1920 edit each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats
