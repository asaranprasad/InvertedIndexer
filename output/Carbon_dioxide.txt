carbon dioxide consists of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms it occurs naturally in earth s atmosphere as a trace gas the current concentration is about 0.04 405 ppm by volume having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm natural sources include volcanoes hot springs and geysers and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids because carbon dioxide is soluble in water it occurs naturally in groundwater rivers and lakes ice caps glaciers and seawater it is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas carbon dioxide is odorless at normally encountered concentrations however at high concentrations it has a sharp and acidic odor 1 as the source of available carbon in the carbon cycle atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary carbon source for life on earth and its concentration in earth s pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the precambrian has been regulated by photosynthetic organisms and geological phenomena plants algae and cyanobacteria use light energy to photosynthesize carbohydrate from carbon dioxide and water with oxygen produced as a waste product 4 co2 is produced by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize carbohydrates and lipids to produce energy by respiration 5 it is returned to water via the gills of fish and to the air via the lungs of air-breathing land animals including humans carbon dioxide is produced during the processes of decay of organic materials and the fermentation of sugars in bread beer and wine making it is produced by combustion of wood and other organic materials and fossil fuels such as coal peat petroleum and natural gas on the other hand it is an unwanted byproduct in many large scale oxidation processes for example in the production of acrylic acid over 5 million tons year 6 7 8 9 it is a versatile industrial material used for example as an inert gas in welding and fire extinguishers as a pressurizing gas in air guns and oil recovery as a chemical feedstock and as a supercritical fluid solvent in decaffeination of coffee 10 and supercritical drying it is added to drinking water and carbonated beverages including beer and sparkling wine to add effervescence the frozen solid form of co2 known as dry ice is used as a refrigerant and as an abrasive in dry-ice blasting carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in earth s atmosphere since the industrial revolution anthropogenic emissions primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere leading to global warming the co2 released into the atmosphere as a result of the use of fossil fuels represents sic 99.4 of co2 emissions in 2013 11 carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves

substance in about 1640 13 the flemish chemist jan baptist van helmont observed that when he burned charcoal in a closed vessel the mass of the resulting ash was much less than that of the original charcoal his interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a gas or wild spirit spiritus sylvestris 14 the properties of carbon dioxide were further studied in the 1750s by the scottish physician joseph black he found that limestone calcium carbonate could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called fixed air he observed that the fixed air was denser than air and supported neither flame nor animal life black also found that when bubbled through limewater a saturated aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide it would precipitate calcium carbonate he used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation in 1772 english chemist joseph priestley published a paper entitled impregnating water with fixed air in which he described a process of dripping sulfuric acid or oil of vitriol as priestley knew it on chalk in order to produce carbon dioxide and forcing the gas to dissolve by agitating a bowl of water in contact with the gas 15 carbon dioxide was first liquefied at elevated pressures in 1823 by humphry davy and michael faraday 16 the earliest description of solid carbon dioxide was given by adrien-jean-pierre thilorier who in 1835 opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a snow of solid co2 17 18 chemical and physical properties edit stretching and bending oscillations of the co 2 carbon dioxide molecule upper left symmetric stretching upper right antisymmetric stretching lower line degenerate pair of bending modes structure and bonding edit the carbon dioxide molecule is linear and centrosymmetric the carbon oxygen bond length is 116.3 pm noticeably shorter than the bond length of a c o single bond and even shorter than most other c o multiply-bonded functional groups 19 since it is centrosymmetric the molecule has no electrical dipole consequently only two vibrational bands are observed in the ir spectrum an antisymmetric stretching mode at 2349 cm 1 and a degenerate pair of bending modes at 667 cm 1 there is also a symmetric stretching mode at 1388 cm 1 which is only observed in the raman spectrum 20 in aqueous solution edit carbon dioxide is soluble in water in which it reversibly forms h 2co 3 carbonic

can help by june 2014 co2 is a weak electrophile its reaction with basic water illustrates this property in which case hydroxide is the nucleophile other nucleophiles react as well for example carbanions as provided by grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react with co2 to give carboxylates mr co 2 rco 2m where m li or mg br and r alkyl or aryl in metal carbon dioxide complexes co2 serves as a ligand which can facilitate the conversion of co2 to other chemicals 22 the reduction of co2 to co is ordinarily a difficult and slow reaction co 2 2 e 2h co h 2o photoautotrophs i e

reaction near ph 7 is about 0.53 v versus the standard hydrogen electrode the nickel-containing enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase catalyses this process 23 physical properties edit pellets of dry ice a common form of solid carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is colorless at low concentrations the gas is odorless however at sufficiently-high concentrations it has a sharp acidic odor 1 at standard temperature and pressure the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98 kg m3 about 1.67 times that of air carbon dioxide has no liquid state at pressures below 5.1 standard atmospheres 520 kpa at 1 atmosphere near mean sea level pressure the gas deposits directly to a solid at temperatures below 78.5 c 109.3 f 194.7 k and the solid sublimes directly to a gas above 78.5 c in its solid state carbon dioxide is commonly called dry ice pressure temperature phase diagram of carbon dioxide liquid carbon dioxide forms only at pressures above 5.1 atm the triple point of carbon dioxide is about 5.1 bar 517 kpa at 217 k see phase diagram the critical point is 7.38 mpa at 31.1 c 24 25 another form of solid carbon dioxide observed at high pressure is an amorphous glass-like solid 26 this form of glass called carbonia is produced by supercooling heated co2 at extreme pressure 40 48 gpa or about 400,000 atmospheres in a diamond anvil this discovery confirmed the theory that carbon dioxide could exist in a glass state similar to other members of its elemental family like silicon silica glass and germanium dioxide unlike silica and germania glasses however carbonia glass is not stable at normal pressures and reverts to gas when pressure is released at temperatures and pressures above the critical point carbon dioxide behaves as a supercritical fluid known as supercritical carbon dioxide isolation and production edit carbon dioxide can be obtained by distillation from air but the method is inefficient industrially carbon dioxide is predominantly an unrecovered waste product produced by several methods which may be practiced at various scales 27 the combustion of all carbon-based fuels such as methane natural gas petroleum distillates gasoline diesel kerosene propane coal wood and generic organic matter produces carbon dioxide and except in the case of pure carbon water as an example the chemical reaction between methane and oxygen ch 4 2 o 2 co 2 2 h 2o it is produced by thermal decomposition of limestone caco 3 by heating calcining at about 850 c 1,560 f in the manufacture of quicklime calcium oxide cao a compound that has many industrial uses caco 3 cao co 2 iron is reduced from its oxides with coke in a blast furnace producing pig iron and carbon dioxide 28 carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the industrial production of hydrogen by steam reforming and ammonia synthesis these processes begin with the reaction of water and natural gas mainly methane 29 acids liberate co2 from most metal carbonates consequently it may be obtained directly from natural carbon dioxide springs where it is produced by the action of acidified water on limestone or dolomite the reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate limestone or chalk is shown below caco 3 2 hcl cacl 2 h 2co 3 the carbonic acid h 2co 3 then decomposes to water and co2 h 2co 3 co 2 h 2o such reactions are accompanied by foaming or bubbling or both as the gas is released they have widespread uses in industry because they can be used to neutralize waste acid streams carbon dioxide is a by-product of the fermentation of sugar in the brewing of beer whisky and other alcoholic beverages and in the production of bioethanol yeast metabolizes sugar to produce co2 and ethanol also known as alcohol as follows c 6h 12o 6 2 co 2 2 c 2h 5oh all aerobic organisms produce co2 when they oxidize carbohydrates fatty acids and proteins the large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily refer to cellular respiration anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis the equation for the respiration of glucose and other monosaccharides is c 6h 12o 6 6 o 2 6 co 2 6 h 2o anaerobic organisms decompose organic material producing methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds 30 regardless of the type of organic material the production of gases follows well defined kinetic pattern carbon dioxide comprises about 40-45 of the gas that emanates from decomposition in landfills termed landfill gas most of the remaining 50-55 is methane 31 applications edit carbon dioxide is used by the food industry the oil industry and the chemical industry 27 the compound has varied commercial uses but one of its greatest use as a chemical is in the production of carbonated beverages it provides the sparkle in carbonated beverages such as soda water precursor to chemicals edit this section needs expansion you can help by july 2014 in the chemical industry carbon dioxide is mainly consumed as an ingredient in the production of urea with a smaller fraction being used to produce methanol and a range of other products 32 such as metal carbonates and bicarbonates citation needed some carboxylic acid derivatives such as sodium salicylate are prepared using co2 by the kolbe-schmitt reaction 33 in addition to conventional processes using co2 for chemical production electrochemical methods are also being explored at a research level in particular the use of renewable energy for production of fuels from co2 such as methanol is attractive as this could result in fuels that could be easily transported and used within conventional combustion technologies but have no net co2 emissions 34 foods edit carbon dioxide bubbles in a soft drink carbon dioxide is a food additive used as a propellant and acidity regulator in the food industry it is approved for usage in the eu 35 listed as e number e290 us 36 and australia and new zealand 37 listed by its ins number 290 a candy called pop rocks is pressurized with carbon dioxide gas 38 at about 4 x 106 pa 40 bar 580 psi when placed in the mouth it dissolves just like other hard candy and releases the gas bubbles with an audible pop leavening agents cause dough to rise by producing carbon dioxide 39 baker s yeast produces carbon dioxide by fermentation of sugars within the dough while chemical leaveners such as baking powder and baking soda release carbon dioxide when heated or if exposed to acids beverages edit carbon dioxide is used to produce carbonated soft drinks and soda water traditionally the carbonation of beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks with carbon dioxide recovered from the fermentation process in the case of bottled and kegged beer the most common method used is carbonation with recycled carbon dioxide with the exception of british real ale draught beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing taps on the bar using pressurized carbon dioxide sometimes mixed with nitrogen wine making edit dry ice used to preserve grapes after harvest carbon dioxide in the form of dry ice is often used during the cold soak phase in wine making to cool clusters of grapes quickly after picking to help prevent spontaneous fermentation by wild yeast the main advantage of using dry ice over water ice is that it cools the grapes without adding any additional water that might decrease the sugar concentration in the grape must and thus the alcohol concentration in the finished wine carbon dioxide is also used to create a hypoxic environment for carbonic maceration the process used to produce beaujolais wine carbon dioxide is sometimes used to top up wine bottles or other storage vessels such as barrels to prevent oxidation though it has the problem that it can dissolve into the wine making a previously still wine slightly fizzy for this reason other gases such as nitrogen or argon are preferred for this process by professional wine makers inert gas edit it is one of the most commonly used compressed gases for pneumatic pressurized gas systems in portable pressure tools carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for welding although in the welding arc it reacts to oxidize most metals use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more brittle than those made in more inert atmospheres it is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as argon or helium citation needed when used for mig welding co2 use is sometimes referred to as mag welding for metal active gas as co2 can react at these high temperatures it tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres improving the flow characteristics although this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site this is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding as it tends to embrittle the site but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding where ultimate ductility is not a major concern it is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 bar 870 psi 59 atm allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation aluminium capsules of co2 are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for air guns paintball markers guns inflating bicycle tires and for making carbonated water rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines high concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests liquid carbon dioxide is used in supercritical drying of some food products and technological materials in the preparation of specimens for scanning electron microscopy citation needed and in the decaffeination of coffee beans fire extinguisher edit use of a co 2 fire extinguisher carbon dioxide can be used to extinguish flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas it does not itself react to extinguish the flame but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it some fire extinguishers especially those designed for electrical fires contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires but not on ordinary combustible fires because although it excludes oxygen it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that unlike water or other chemical based methods carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits leading to even more damage to equipment because it is a gas it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in it infrastructure rooms where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space 40 international maritime organization standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations a review of co2 systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report 2000 causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries 41 supercritical co2 as solvent edit liquid carbon dioxide is a good solvent for many lipophilic organic compounds and is used to remove caffeine from coffee carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the pharmaceutical and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as organochlorides it is used by some dry cleaners for this reason see green chemistry it is used in the preparation of some aerogels because of the properties of supercritical carbon dioxide agricultural and biological applications edit plants require carbon dioxide to conduct photosynthesis the atmospheres of greenhouses may if of large size must be enriched with additional co2 to sustain and increase the rate of plant growth 42 43 at very high concentrations 100 times atmospheric concentration or greater carbon dioxide can be toxic to animal life so raising the concentration to 10,000 ppm 1 or higher for several hours will eliminate pests such as whiteflies and spider mites in a greenhouse 44 it has been proposed that co2 from power generation be bubbled into ponds to stimulate growth of algae that could then be converted into biodiesel fuel 45 medical and pharmacological uses edit in medicine up to 5 carbon dioxide 130 times atmospheric concentration is added to oxygen for stimulation of breathing after apnea and to stabilize the o 2 co 2 balance in blood carbon dioxide can be mixed with up to 50 oxygen forming an inhalable gas this is known as carbogen and has a variety of medical and research uses oil recovery edit carbon dioxide is used in enhanced oil recovery where it is injected into or adjacent to producing oil wells usually under supercritical conditions when it becomes miscible with the oil this approach can increase original oil recovery by reducing residual oil saturation by between 7 to 23 additional to primary extraction 46 it acts as both a pressurizing agent and when dissolved into the underground crude oil significantly reduces its viscosity and changing surface chemistry enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the reservoir to the removal well 47 in mature oil fields extensive pipe networks are used to carry the carbon dioxide to the injection points bio transformation into fuel edit a strain of the cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus has been genetically engineered to produce the fuels isobutyraldehyde and isobutanol from co2 using photosynthesis 48 refrigerant edit comparison of phase diagrams of carbon dioxide red and water blue as a log-lin chart with phase transitions points at 1 atmosphere liquid and solid carbon dioxide are important refrigerants especially in the food industry where they are employed during the transportation and storage of ice cream and other frozen foods solid carbon dioxide is called dry ice and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical solid carbon dioxide is always below 78.5 c at regular atmospheric pressure regardless of the air temperature liquid carbon dioxide industry nomenclature r744 or r-744 was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of r-12 and may enjoy a renaissance due to the fact that r134a contributes to climate change more than co2 does its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling refrigeration and heating purposes having a high volumetric cooling capacity due to the need to operate at pressures of up to 130 bar 1880 psi co2 systems require highly resistant components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors in automobile air conditioning in more than 90 of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50 r744 operates more efficiently than systems using r134a its environmental advantages gwp of 1 non-ozone depleting non-toxic non-flammable could make it the future working fluid to replace current hfcs in cars supermarkets and heat pump water heaters among others coca-cola has fielded co2-based beverage coolers and the u s army is interested in co2 refrigeration and heating technology 49 50 the global automobile industry is expected to decide on the next-generation refrigerant in car air conditioning co2 is one discussed option see sustainable automotive air conditioning coal bed methane recovery edit in enhanced coal bed methane recovery carbon dioxide would be pumped into the coal seam to displace methane as opposed to current methods which primarily rely on the removal of water to reduce pressure to make the coal seam release its trapped methane 51 minor uses edit a carbon dioxide laser carbon dioxide is the lasing medium in a carbon dioxide laser which is one of the earliest type of lasers carbon dioxide can be used as a means of controlling the ph of swimming pools 52 by continuously adding gas to the water thus keeping the ph from rising among the advantages of this is the avoidance of handling more hazardous acids similarly it is also used in the maintaining reef aquaria where it is commonly used in calcium reactors to temporarily lower the ph of water being passed over calcium carbonate in order to allow the calcium carbonate to dissolve into the water more freely where it is used by some corals to build their skeleton used as the primary coolant in the british advanced gas-cooled reactor for nuclear power generation carbon dioxide induction is commonly used for the euthanasia of laboratory research animals methods to administer co2 include placing animals directly into a closed prefilled chamber containing co2 or exposure to a gradually increasing concentration of co2 in 2013 the american veterinary medical association issued new guidelines for carbon dioxide induction stating that a displacement rate of 10 to 30 of the gas chamber volume per minute is optimal for the humane euthanization of small rodents 53 carbon dioxide is also used in several related cleaning and surface preparation techniques in earth s atmosphere edit the keeling curve of atmospheric co 2 concentrations measured at mauna loa observatory carbon dioxide in earth s atmosphere is a trace gas currently early 2017 having a global average concentration of 404 parts per million by volume 54 55 56 or 614 parts per million by mass atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide fluctuate slightly with the seasons falling during the northern hemisphere spring and summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant or die and decay concentrations also vary on a regional basis most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft in urban areas concentrations are generally higher 57 and indoors they can reach 10 times background levels yearly increase of atmospheric co 2 in the 1960s the average annual increase was 37 of the 2000 2007 average 58 the concentration of carbon dioxide has risen due to human activities 59 combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation have caused the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide to increase by about 43 since the beginning of the age of industrialization 60 most carbon dioxide from human activities is released from burning coal and other fossil fuels other human activities including deforestation biomass burning and cement production also produce carbon dioxide human activities emit about 29 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year while volcanoes emit between 0.2 and 0.3 billion tons 61 62 human activities have caused co2 to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels remains in the atmosphere and is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans 63 64 65 66 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas absorbing and emitting infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies see the section structure and bonding above this causes carbon dioxide to warm the surface and lower atmosphere while cooling the upper atmosphere 67 68 increases in atmospheric concentrations of co2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century carbon dioxide is of greatest concern because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than all of these other gases combined and because it has a long atmospheric lifetime hundreds to thousands of years co 2 in earth s atmosphere if half of global-warming emissions are not absorbed 63 64 65 66 nasa computer simulation not only do increasing carbon dioxide concentrations lead to increases in global surface temperature but increasing global temperatures also cause increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide this produces a positive feedback for changes induced by other processes such as orbital cycles 69 five hundred million years ago the carbon dioxide concentration was 20 times greater than today decreasing to 4 5 times during the jurassic period and then slowly declining with a particularly swift reduction occurring 49 million years ago 70 71 local concentrations of carbon dioxide can reach high values near strong sources especially those that are isolated by surrounding terrain at the bossoleto hot spring near rapolano terme in tuscany italy situated in a bowl-shaped depression about 100 m 330 ft in diameter concentrations of co2 rise to above 75 overnight sufficient to kill insects and small animals after sunrise the gas is dispersed by convection 72 high concentrations of co2 produced by disturbance of deep lake water saturated with co2 are thought to have caused 37 fatalities at lake monoun cameroon in 1984 and 1700 casualties at lake nyos cameroon in 1986 73 in the oceans edit pterapod shell dissolved in seawater adjusted to an ocean chemistry projected for the year 2100 carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean to form carbonic acid h2co3 bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co32 there is about fifty times as much carbon dissolved in the oceans as exists in the atmosphere the oceans act as an enormous carbon sink and have taken up about a third of co2 emitted by human activity 74 as the concentration of carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere the increased uptake of carbon dioxide into the oceans is causing a measurable decrease in the ph of the oceans which is referred to as ocean acidification this reduction in ph affects biological systems in the oceans primarily oceanic calcifying organisms these effects span the food chain from autotrophs to heterotrophs and include organisms such as coccolithophores corals foraminifera echinoderms crustaceans and mollusks under normal conditions calcium carbonate is stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at supersaturating concentrations however as ocean ph falls so does the concentration of this ion and when carbonate becomes undersaturated structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution 75 corals 76 77 78 coccolithophore algae 79 80 81 82 coralline algae 83 foraminifera 84 shellfish 85 and pteropods 86 experience reduced calcification or enhanced dissolution when exposed to elevated co 2 gas solubility decreases as the temperature of water increases except when both pressure exceeds 300 bar and temperature exceeds 393 k only found near deep geothermal vents 87 and therefore the rate of uptake from the atmosphere decreases as ocean temperatures rise most of the co2 taken up by the ocean which is about 30 of the total released into the atmosphere 88 forms carbonic acid in equilibrium with bicarbonate some of these chemical species are consumed by photosynthetic organisms that remove carbon from the cycle increased co2 in the atmosphere has led to decreasing alkalinity of seawater and there is concern that this may adversely affect organisms living in the water in particular with decreasing alkalinity the availability of carbonates for forming shells decreases 89 although there s evidence of increased shell production by certain species under increased co2 content 90 noaa states in their may 2008 state of the science fact sheet for ocean acidification that the oceans have absorbed about 50 of the carbon dioxide co2 released from the burning of fossil fuels resulting in chemical reactions that lower ocean ph this has caused an increase in hydrogen ion acidity of about 30 since the start of the industrial age through a process known as ocean acidification a growing number of studies have demonstrated adverse impacts on marine organisms including the rate at which reef-building corals produce their skeletons decreases while production of numerous varieties of jellyfish increases the ability of marine algae and free-swimming zooplankton to maintain protective shells is reduced the survival of larval marine species including commercial fish and shellfish is reduced also the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc writes in their climate change 2007 synthesis report 91 the uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in ph of 0.1 units increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations lead to further acidification while the effects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented the progressive acidification of oceans is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-forming organisms e g corals and their dependent species some marine calcifying organisms including coral reefs have been singled out by major research agencies including noaa ospar commission nanoos and the ipcc because their most current research shows that ocean acidification should be expected to impact them negatively 92 carbon dioxide is also introduced into the oceans through hydrothermal vents the champagne hydrothermal vent found at the northwest eifuku volcano in the marianas trench produces almost pure liquid carbon dioxide one of only two known sites in the world as of 2004 the other being in the okinawa trough 93 the finding of a submarine lake of liquid carbon dioxide in the okinawa trough was reported in 2006 94 biological role edit carbon dioxide is an end product of cellular respiration in organisms that obtain energy by breaking down sugars fats and amino acids with oxygen as part of their metabolism this includes all plants algae and animals and aerobic fungi and bacteria in vertebrates the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body s tissues to the skin e g amphibians or the gills e g fish from where it dissolves in the water or to the lungs from where it is exhaled during active photosynthesis plants can absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they release in respiration photosynthesis and carbon fixation edit overview of photosynthesis and respiration carbon dioxide at right together with water form oxygen and organic compounds at left by photosynthesis which can be respired to water and co 2 overview of the calvin cycle and carbon fixation carbon fixation is a biochemical process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated by plants algae and cyanobacteria into energy-rich organic molecules such as glucose thus creating their own food by photosynthesis photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars from which other organic compounds can be constructed and oxygen is produced as a by-product ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase commonly abbreviated to rubisco is the enzyme involved in the first major step of carbon fixation the production of two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate from co2 and ribulose bisphosphate as shown in the diagram at left rubisco is thought to be the single most abundant protein on earth 95 phototrophs use the products of their photosynthesis as internal food sources and as raw material for the biosynthesis of more complex organic molecules such as polysaccharides nucleic acids and proteins these are used for their own growth and also as the basis of the food chains and webs that feed other organisms including animals such as ourselves some important phototrophs the coccolithophores synthesise hard calcium carbonate scales 96 a globally significant species of coccolithophore is emiliania huxleyi whose calcite scales have formed the basis of many sedimentary rocks such as limestone where what was previously atmospheric carbon can remain fixed for geological timescales plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm co2 when compared with ambient conditions though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients 97 elevated co2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops with wheat rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12 14 under elevated co2 in face experiments 98 99 increased atmospheric co2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants 100 which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency 101 studies using face have shown that co2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants 102 this may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein 103 the concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids can also be altered in plants exposed to high concentrations of co2 104 105 plants also emit co2 during respiration and so the majority of plants and algae which use c3 photosynthesis are only net absorbers during the day though a growing forest will absorb many tons of co2 each year a mature forest will produce as much co2 from respiration and decomposition of dead specimens e g fallen branches as is used in photosynthesis in growing plants 106 contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral mature forests can continue to accumulate carbon 107 and remain valuable carbon sinks helping to maintain the carbon balance of earth s atmosphere additionally and crucially to life on earth photosynthesis by phytoplankton consumes dissolved co2 in the upper ocean and thereby promotes the absorption of co2 from the atmosphere 108 toxicity edit main symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity by increasing volume percent in air 109 carbon dioxide content in fresh air averaged between sea-level and 10 kpa level i e about 30 km 19 mi altitude varies between 0.036 360 ppm and 0.041 410 ppm depending on the location 110 clarification needed co2 is an asphyxiant gas and not classified as toxic or harmful in accordance with globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals standards of united nations economic commission for europe by using the oecd guidelines for the testing of chemicals in concentrations up to 1 10,000 ppm it will make some people feel drowsy and give the lungs a stuffy feeling 109 concentrations of 7 to 10 70,000 to 100,000 ppm may cause suffocation even in the presence of sufficient oxygen manifesting as dizziness headache visual and hearing dysfunction and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour 111 the physiological effects of acute carbon dioxide exposure are grouped together under the term hypercapnia a subset of asphyxiation because it is heavier than air in locations where the gas seeps from the ground due to sub-surface volcanic or geothermal activity in relatively high concentrations without the dispersing effects of wind it can collect in sheltered pocketed locations below average ground level causing animals located therein to be suffocated carrion feeders attracted to the carcasses are then also killed children have been killed in the same way near the city of goma by co2 emissions from the nearby volcano mt nyiragongo 112 the swahili term for this phenomenon is mazuku rising levels of co 2 threatened the apollo 13 astronauts who had to adapt cartridges from the command module to supply the carbon dioxide scrubber in the lunar module which they used as a lifeboat adaptation to increased concentrations of co2 occurs in humans including modified breathing and kidney bicarbonate production in order to balance the effects of blood acidification acidosis several studies suggested that 2.0 percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces e g a submarine since the adaptation is physiological and reversible as decrement in performance or in normal physical activity does not happen at this level of exposure for five days 113 114 yet other studies show a decrease in cognitive function even at much lower levels 115 116 also with ongoing respiratory acidosis adaptation or compensatory mechanisms will be unable to reverse such condition below 1 edit there are few studies of the health effects of long-term continuous co2 exposure on humans and animals at levels below 1 occupational co2 exposure limits have been set in the united states at 0.5 5000 ppm for an eight-hour period 117 at this co2 concentration international space station crew experienced headaches lethargy mental slowness emotional irritation and sleep disruption 118 studies in animals at 0.5 co2 have demonstrated kidney calcification and bone loss after eight weeks of exposure 119 a study of humans exposed in 2.5 hour sessions demonstrated significant effects on cognitive abilities at concentrations as low as 0.1 1000ppm co2 likely due to co2 induced increases in cerebral blood flow 115 another study observed a decline in basic activity level and information usage at 1000 ppm when compared to 500 ppm 116 ventilation edit poor ventilation is one of the main causes of excessive co2 concentrations in closed spaces carbon dioxide differential above outdoor concentrations at steady state conditions when the occupancy and ventilation system operation are sufficiently long that co2 concentration has stabilized are sometimes used to estimate ventilation rates per person citation needed higher co2 concentrations are associated with occupant health comfort and performance degradation citation needed ashrae standard 62.1 2007 ventilation rates may result in indoor concentrations up to 2,100 ppm above ambient outdoor conditions thus if the outdoor concentration is 400 ppm indoor concentrations may reach 2,500 ppm with ventilation rates that meet this industry consensus standard concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this range of 3,000 or 4,000 miners who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to an insufficient ventilation referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as blackdamp choke damp or stythe before more effective technologies were developed miners would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged canary with them as they worked the canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch the davy lamp could also detect high levels of blackdamp which sinks and collects near the floor by burning less brightly while methane another suffocating gas and explosion risk would make the lamp burn more brightly human physiology edit content edit reference ranges or averages for partial

produces approximately 2.3 pounds 1.0 kg of carbon dioxide per day per person 121 containing 0.63 pounds 290 g of carbon in humans this carbon dioxide is carried through the venous system and is breathed out through the lungs resulting in lower concentrations in the arteries the carbon dioxide content of the blood is often given as the partial pressure which is the pressure which carbon dioxide would have had if it alone occupied the volume 122 in humans the blood carbon dioxide contents is shown in the table to the right transport in the blood edit co2 is carried in blood in three different ways the exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood most of it about 70 to 80 is converted to bicarbonate ions hco 3 by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells 123 by the reaction co2 h 2o h 2co 3 h hco 3 5 10 is dissolved in the plasma 123 5 10 is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds 123 hemoglobin the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide however the co2 bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen instead it combines with the n-terminal groups on the four globin chains however because of allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule the binding of co2 decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen this is known as the haldane effect and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs conversely a rise in the partial pressure of co2 or a lower ph will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin

capillaries expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood ph a person s breathing rate influences the level of co2 in their blood breathing that is too slow or shallow causes respiratory acidosis while breathing that is too rapid leads to hyperventilation which can cause respiratory alkalosis although the body requires oxygen for metabolism low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing rather breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels as a result breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all such as pure nitrogen can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing air hunger this is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots it is also why flight attendants instruct passengers in case of loss of cabin pressure to apply the oxygen mask to themselves first before helping others otherwise one risks losing consciousness 123 the respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial co2 pressure of 40 mm hg with intentional hyperventilation the co2 content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10 20 mm hg the oxygen content of the blood is little affected and the respiratory drive is diminished this is why one can hold one s breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating this carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving additional media edit 3d model of co2 s homo 3d model of co2 s lumo see also edit acidosis
