germanic languages are a branch of the indo-european language family spoken natively by a population of about 515 million people nb 1 mainly in europe north america oceania and southern africa the west germanic languages include the three most widely spoken germanic languages english with around 360 400 million native speakers 3 nb 2 german with over 100 million native speakers 4 and dutch with 23 million native speakers other west germanic languages include afrikaans an offshoot of dutch with over 7.1 million native speakers 5 low german considered a separate collection of unstandardized

and the frisian languages with over 0.5 million native speakers in the netherlands and germany the main north germanic languages are swedish danish norwegian icelandic and faroese which have a combined total of about 20 million speakers the east germanic branch included gothic burgundian and vandalic all of which are now extinct the last to die off was crimean gothic spoken until the late 18th century in some isolated areas of crimea 11 the sil ethnologue lists 48 different living germanic languages 41 of which belong to the western branch and six to the northern branch it places riograndenser hunsr ckisch german in neither of the categories but it is often considered a german dialect by linguists 12 the total number of germanic languages throughout history is unknown as some of them especially the east germanic languages disappeared during or after the migration period some of the west germanic languages also did not survive past the migration period including lombardic as a result of world war ii the german language suffered a significant loss of sprachraum as well as moribundness and extinction of several of its dialects in the 21st century its dialects are dying out anyway nb 3 due to standard german gaining primacy 13 the common ancestor of all of the languages in this branch is called proto-germanic also known as common germanic which was spoken in about the middle of the 1st millennium bc in iron age scandinavia proto-germanic along with all of its descendants is characterised by a number of unique linguistic features most famously the consonant change known as grimm s law early varieties of germanic entered history with the germanic tribes moving south from scandinavia in the 2nd century bc to settle in the area of today s northern germany

west germanic continental west germanic languages old frisian old saxon old dutch old high german crimean gothic east germanic all germanic languages are thought to be descended from a hypothetical proto-germanic united by subjection to the sound shifts of grimm s law and verner s law these probably took place during the pre-roman iron age of northern europe from c 500 bc proto-germanic itself was likely spoken after c 500 bc 34 and proto-norse from the 2nd century ad and later is still quite close to reconstructed proto-germanic but other common innovations separating germanic from proto-indo-european suggest a common history of pre-proto-germanic speakers throughout the nordic bronze age from the time of their earliest attestation the germanic varieties are divided into three groups west east and north germanic their exact relation is difficult to determine from the sparse evidence of runic inscriptions the western group would have formed in the late jastorf culture and the eastern group may be derived from the 1st-century variety of gotland leaving southern sweden as the original location of the northern group the earliest period of elder futhark 2nd to 4th centuries predates the division in regional script variants and linguistically essentially still reflect the common germanic stage vimose inscriptions ad 160 are the oldest germanic writing the earliest coherent germanic text preserved is the 4th century gothic translation of the new testament by ulfilas early testimonies of west germanic are in old frankish old dutch the 5th century bergakker inscription old high german scattered words and sentences 6th century and coherent texts 9th century and old english oldest texts 650 coherent texts 10th century north germanic is only attested in scattered runic inscriptions as proto-norse until it evolves into old norse by about 800 longer runic inscriptions survive from the 8th and 9th centuries eggjum stone r k stone longer texts in the latin alphabet survive from the 12th century slendingab k and some skaldic poetry dates back to as early as the 9th century by about the 10th century the varieties had diverged enough to make inter-comprehensibility difficult the linguistic contact of the viking settlers of the danelaw with the anglo-saxons left traces in the english language and is suspected to have facilitated the collapse of old english grammar that resulted in middle english from the 12th century the east germanic languages were marginalized from the end of the migration period the burgundians goths and vandals became linguistically assimilated by their respective neighbors by about the 7th century with only crimean gothic lingering on until the 18th century during the early middle ages the west germanic languages were separated by the insular development of middle english on one hand and by the high german consonant shift on the continent on the other resulting in upper german and low saxon with graded intermediate central german varieties by early modern times the span had extended into considerable differences ranging from highest alemannic in the south to northern low saxon in the north and although both extremes are considered german they are hardly mutually intelligible the southernmost varieties had completed the second sound shift while the northern varieties remained unaffected by the consonant shift the north germanic languages on the other hand remained unified until well past 1000 ad and in fact the mainland scandinavian languages still largely retain mutual intelligibility into modern times the main split in these languages is between the mainland languages and the island languages to the west especially icelandic which has maintained the grammar of old norse virtually unchanged while the mainland languages have diverged greatly characteristics edit germanic languages possess a number of defining features compared with other indo-european languages probably the most well-known are the following the sound changes known as grimm s law and verner s law which shifted the values of all the indo-european stop consonants for example original t d dh became germanic t d in most cases compare three with latin tres two with latin duo do with sanskrit dha- the recognition of these two sound laws were seminal events in the understanding of the regular nature of linguistic sound change and the development of the comparative method which forms the basis of modern historical linguistics the development of a strong stress on the first syllable of the word which triggered significant phonological reduction of all other syllables this is responsible for the reduction of most of the basic english norwegian danish and swedish words into monosyllables and the common impression of modern english and german as consonant-heavy languages examples are proto-germanic strangi strength aimaitij ant haubudan head hauzijanan hear harubistaz german herbst autumn harvest hagatusj german hexe witch hag a change known as germanic umlaut which modified vowel qualities when a high front vocalic segment i i or j followed in the next syllable generally back vowels were fronted and front vowels were raised in many languages the modified vowels are indicated with a diaeresis e g in german pronounced y respectively this change resulted in pervasive alternations in related words still extremely prominent in modern german but present only in remnants in modern english e g mouse mice goose geese broad breadth tell told old elder foul filth gold gild 35 large numbers of vowel qualities english is typical in this respect with around 11 12 vowels in most dialects not counting diphthongs standard swedish has 17 pure vowels monophthongs 36 standard german and dutch 14 and danish at least 11 37 the amstetten dialect of bavarian german has 13 distinctions among long vowels alone one of the largest such inventories in the world 38 verb second v2 word order which is uncommon cross-linguistically exactly one noun phrase or adverbial element must precede the verb in particular if an adverb or prepositional phrase precedes the verb then the subject must immediately follow the finite verb this is no longer present in modern english except in sentences beginning with here is there is here comes there goes and related expressions as well as in a few relic sentences such as over went the boat pop goes the weasel the palindrome able was i ere i saw elba or boom goes the dynamite and in most if not all if not an absolute of the five ws and one h questions e g what has happened here who was here today where will we go when did he go to the stadium why would this happen to us now and how could these things get here but is found in all other modern germanic languages other significant characteristics are the reduction of the various tense and aspect combinations of the indo-european verbal system into only two the present tense and the past tense also called the preterite a large class of verbs that use a dental suffix d or t instead of vowel alternation indo-european ablaut to indicate past tense these are called the germanic weak verbs the remaining verbs with vowel ablaut are the germanic strong verbs a distinction in definiteness of a noun phrase that is marked by different sets of inflectional endings for adjectives the so-called strong and weak adjectives a similar development happened in the balto-slavic languages this distinction has been lost in modern english but was present in old english and remains in all other germanic languages to various degrees some words with etymologies that are difficult to link to other indo-european families but with variants that appear in almost all germanic languages see germanic substrate hypothesis note that some of the above characteristics were not present in proto-germanic but developed later as areal features that spread from language to language germanic umlaut only affected the north and west germanic languages which represent all modern germanic languages but not the now-extinct east germanic languages such as gothic nor proto-germanic the common ancestor of all germanic languages the large inventory of vowel qualities is a later development due to a combination of germanic umlaut and the tendency in many germanic languages for pairs of long short vowels of originally identical quality to develop distinct qualities with the length distinction sometimes eventually lost proto-germanic had only five distinct vowel qualities although there were more actual vowel phonemes because length and possibly nasality were phonemic in modern german long-short vowel pairs still exist but are also distinct in quality proto-germanic probably had a more general s-o-v-i word order however the tendency toward v2 order may have already been present in latent form and may be related to wackernagel s law an indo-european law dictating that sentence clitics must be placed second 39 roughly speaking germanic languages differ in how conservative or how progressive each language is with respect to an overall trend toward analyticity some such as icelandic and to a lesser extent german have preserved much of the complex inflectional morphology inherited from proto-germanic and in turn from proto-indo-european others such as english swedish and afrikaans have moved toward a largely analytic type linguistic developments edit the subgroupings of the germanic languages are defined by shared innovations it is important to distinguish innovations from cases of linguistic conservatism that is if two languages in a family share a characteristic that is not observed in a third language that is evidence of common ancestry of the two languages only if the characteristic is an innovation compared to the family s proto-language the following innovations are common to the northwest germanic languages all but gothic the lowering of u to o in initial syllables before a in the following syllable a-umlaut traditionally called brechung labial umlaut in unstressed medial syllables the conversion of a to u and to before m or u in the following syllable 40 the conversion of 1 into vs gothic in stressed syllables 41 in unstressed syllables west germanic also has this change but north germanic has shortened the vowel to e then raised it to i this suggests it was an areal change the raising of final to u gothic lowers it to a it is kept distinct from the nasal which is not raised the monophthongisation of ai and au to and in non-initial syllables however evidence for the development of au in medial syllables is lacking the development of an intensified demonstrative ending in s reflected in english this compared to the introduction of a distinct ablaut grade in class vii strong verbs while gothic uses reduplication e g gothic haihait on oe h t preterite of the gmc verb haitan to be called 42 as part of a comprehensive reformation of the gmc class vii from a reduplicating to a new ablaut pattern which presumably started in verbs beginning with vowel or h 43 a development which continues the general trend of de-reduplication in gmc 44 there are forms such as oe dial heht instead of h t which retain traces of reduplication even in west and north germanic the following innovations are also common to the northwest germanic languages but represent areal changes proto-germanic z r e g gothic dius on d r ohg tior oe d or wild animal note that this is not present in proto-norse and must be ordered after west germanic loss of final z germanic umlaut the following innovations are common to the west germanic languages loss of final z in single-syllable words old high german retains it as r while it disappears in the other west germanic languages change of fricative allophone of d to stop d in all environments change of l to stop ld except word-finally 45 west germanic gemination of consonants

particular type of umlaut e-u-i i-u-i the change of b or g to w before nasal consonant 46 changes to the 2nd person singular past-tense replacement of the past-singular stem vowel with the past-plural

english plural - e s but german plural -e possibly the monophthongization of germanic ai to this may represent independent changes in old saxon and anglo-frisian the following innovations are common

where c represents any consonant and v any vowel monophthongization of ai into common linguistic features edit phonology edit the oldest germanic languages all share a number of features which are assumed to be inherited from proto-germanic phonologically it includes the important sound changes known as grimm s law and verner s law which introduced a large number of fricatives late proto-indo-european had only one s the main vowel developments are the merging in most circumstances of long and short a and o producing short a and long that likewise affected the diphthongs with pie ai and oi merging into ai and pie au and ou merging into au pie ei developed into long pie long developed into a vowel denoted as 1 often assumed to be phonetically while a new fairly uncommon long vowel 2 developed in varied and not completely understood circumstances proto-germanic had no front rounded vowels but all germanic languages except for gothic subsequently developed them through the process of i-umlaut proto-germanic developed a strong stress accent on the first syllable of the root but remnants of the original free pie accent are visible due to verner s law which was sensitive to this accent that caused a steady erosion of vowels in unstressed syllables in proto-germanic that had progressed only to the point that absolutely-final short vowels other than i and u were lost and absolutely-final long vowels were shortened but all of the early literary languages show a more advanced state of vowel loss this ultimately resulted in some languages like modern english losing practically all vowels following the main stress and the consequent rise of a very large number of monosyllabic words table of outcomes edit the following table shows the main outcomes of proto-germanic vowels and consonants in the various older languages for vowels only the outcomes in stressed syllables are shown outcomes in unstressed syllables are quite different vary from language to language and depend on a number of other factors such as whether the syllable was medial or final whether the syllable was open or closed and in some cases whether the preceding syllable was light or heavy notes c- means before a vowel word-initially or sometimes after a consonant -c- means between vowels -c means after a vowel word-finally or before a consonant word-final outcomes generally occurred after deletion of final short vowels which occurred shortly after proto-germanic and is reflected in the history of all written languages except for proto-norse the above three are given in the order c- -c- -c if one is omitted the previous one applies for example f - v - means that v occurs after a vowel regardless of what follows something like a u means a if u occurs in the next syllable something like a n means a if n immediately follows something like n a means a if n immediately precedes development of germanic sounds proto-germanic 47 48 pre- gothic a 49 50 old norse 51

proto-germanic e and before vowels proto-germanic e and i before h h and r greek the spelling au is similarly used to represent vowels primarily deriving from the following four sources proto-germanic au proto-germanic o and u before vowels proto-germanic u before h h and r greek it is generally agreed that the outcome of case 2 was pronounced in gothic distinct from the vowels written e and o which were pronounced e o likewise it is generally agreed that the outcomes of cases 3 and 4 were pronounced and in gothic however there is some argument over whether the outcomes of case 1 were still pronounced as diphthongs ai au as in proto-germanic or had merged with case 2 as monophthongs there is some historical evidence particularly from latin spelling variations of gaut- vs g t- used to represent the name of the goths that the proto-germanic diphthongs had changed into monophthongs shortly before i e within a century of the time of wulfila who designed the gothic alphabet and wrote the gothic bible c 360 ad this accords with the fact that wulfila used the same symbols ai au to represent all the outcomes despite the fact that the spellings aj aw were available to unambiguously represent diphthongs and in fact alternate with ai au in a number of nominal and verbal paradigms the use of the spelling ai to represent a monophthong was evidently in imitation of 4th century greek where ai likewise stood for and au was apparently created by analogy consistent with many sources e g bennett 1980 the phonology described here is that of pre-gothic i e the phonology of gothic just before the monophthongization of ai and au a b c d e f g in old norse non-rounded vowels become rounded when a u or w follows in the next syllable in a process known as u-umlaut some vowels were affected similarly but only by a following w this process is sometimes termed w-umlaut these processes operated after i-umlaut u-umlaut by a following u or w caused a ja broken e a and e to round to

w-umlaut a b c d e a process known as a-mutation or a-umlaut caused short u to lower to o before a non-high vowel usually a in the following syllable all languages except gothic were affected although there are various exceptions in all the languages two similar process later operated in old high german iu from proto-germanic eu iu became io before a non-high vowel in the next syllable in old english from proto-germanic a became a before a in the next syllable all of these processes were blocked in an i-umlaut context i e by a following j a b c d e the diphthongal results are due to old

written ie all diphthongs umlaut to iy ie all diphthongs occur both long and short note that there is significant dispute about the actual pronunciation of io and especially ie their interpretation as iu and iy respectively follows lass 1994 old english a historical linguistic companion a b c d e f g h i j all languages except gothic were affected by i-umlaut this was the most significant of the various umlaut processes operating in the germanic languages and caused back vowels to become fronted and front vowels to be raised when i i or j followed in the next syllable the term i-umlaut actually refers to two separate processes that both were triggered in the same environment the earlier process raised e and eu to i and iu respectively and may have operated still in proto-germanic with its effects in gothic obscured due to later changes the later process affected all back vowels and some front vowels it operated independently in the various languages occurring at differing times with differing results old english was the earliest and most-affected language with nearly all vowels affected old high german was the last language to be affected the only written evidence of the process is with short a which is umlauted to e however later evidence suggests that other back vowels were also affected perhaps still sub-phonemically in old high german times these are indicated with a diaeresis or umlaut symbol two dots placed over the affected vowels proto-germanic e usually became old norse ja by a process known as vowel breaking before proto-germanic x x or r but not

when occurring after a vowel or after certain consonants and for g also initially hard g occurred only in the combinations gg ng in old norse and old english voiceless fricatives became voiced between vowels and finally after a vowel in old norse as a result voiced fricatives were reanalyzed as allophones of voiceless fricatives in old high german all voiced fricatives hardened into stops in the early periods of the various languages the sound written r may have been strongly velarized as in modern american english lass 1994 this is one possible explanation for the various processes were triggered by h probably x and r a b old english and old norse lose n before certain consonants with the previous vowel lengthened in old norse the following consonant is also lengthened n lost finally and before s p t k but not before other consonants a b proto-germanic j and w were often lost between vowels in all languages often with j or w later reappearing to break the hiatus and not always corresponding to the sound previously present after a consonant gothic consistently preserved j and w but most languages deleted j after triggering i-umlaut and w sometimes disappeared the loss of j after a consonant occurred in the various languages at different times and to differing degrees for example j was still present in most circumstances in written old saxon and was still present in old norse when a short vowel preceded and a back vowel followed but in old english and old high german j only remained after an r preceded by a short vowel morphology edit the oldest germanic languages have the typical complex inflected morphology of old indo-european languages with four or five noun cases verbs marked for person number tense and mood multiple noun and verb classes few or no articles and rather free word order the old germanic languages are famous for having only two tenses present and past with three pie past-tense aspects imperfect aorist and perfect stative merged into one and no new tenses future pluperfect etc developing there were three moods indicative subjunctive developed from the pie optative mood and imperative gothic verbs had a number of archaic features inherited from pie that were lost in the other germanic languages with few traces including dual endings an inflected passive voice derived from the pie mediopassive voice and a class of verbs with reduplication in the past tense derived from the pie perfect the complex tense system of modern english e g in three months the house will still be being built or if you had not acted so stupidly we would never have been caught is almost entirely due to subsequent developments although paralleled in many of the other germanic languages among the primary innovations in proto-germanic are the preterite present verbs a special set of verbs whose present tense looks like the past tense of other verbs and which is the origin of most modal verbs in english a past-tense ending in the so-called weak verbs marked with -ed in english that appears variously as d or t often assumed to be derived from the verb to do and two separate sets of adjective endings originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics a man with a combination of pie adjective and pronoun endings and definite semantics the man with endings derived from pie n-stem nouns note that most modern germanic languages have lost most of the inherited inflectional morphology as a result of the steady attrition of unstressed endings triggered by the strong initial stress contrast for example the balto-slavic languages which have largely kept the indo-european pitch accent and consequently preserved much of the inherited morphology icelandic and to a lesser extent modern german best preserve the proto germanic inflectional system with four noun cases three genders and well-marked verbs english and afrikaans are at the other extreme with almost no remaining inflectional morphology the

instrumental fisk-amiz strong vs weak nouns and adjectives edit originally adjectives in proto-indo-european followed the same declensional classes as nouns the most common class the o class used a combination of o-stem endings for masculine and neuter genders and -stems ending for feminine genders but other common classes e g the i class and u class used endings from a single vowel-stem declension for all genders and various other classes existed that were based on other declensions a quite different set of pronominal endings was used for pronouns determiners and words with related semantics e g all only an important innovation in proto-germanic was the development of two separate sets of adjective endings originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics a man and definite semantics the man the endings of indefinite adjectives were derived from a combination of pronominal endings with one of the common vowel-stem adjective declensions usually the o class often termed the a class in the specific context of the germanic languages but sometimes the i or u classes definite adjectives however had endings based on n-stem nouns originally both types of adjectives could be used by themselves but already by proto-germanic times a pattern evolved whereby definite adjectives had to be accompanied by a determiner with definite semantics e g a definite article demonstrative pronoun possessive pronoun or the like while indefinite adjectives were used in other circumstances either accompanied by a word with indefinite semantics such as a one or some or unaccompanied in the 19th century the two types of adjectives indefinite and definite were respectively termed strong and weak names which are still commonly used these names were based on the appearance of the two sets of endings in modern german in german the distinctive case endings formerly present on nouns have largely disappeared with the result that the load of distinguishing one case from another is almost entirely carried by determiners and adjectives furthermore due to regular sound change the various definite n-stem adjective endings coalesced to the point where only two endings -e and -en remain in modern german to express the sixteen possible inflectional categories of the language masculine feminine neuter plural crossed with nominative accusative dative genitive modern german merges all genders in the plural the indefinite a -stem adjective endings were less affected by sound change with six endings remaining - -e -es -er -em -en cleverly distributed in a way that is capable of expressing the various inflectional categories without too much ambiguity as a result the definite endings were thought of as too weak to carry inflectional meaning and in need of strengthening by the presence of an accompanying determiner while the indefinite endings were viewed as strong enough to indicate the inflectional categories even when standing alone this view is enhanced by the fact that modern german largely uses weak-ending adjectives when accompanying an indefinite article and hence the indefinite definite distinction no longer clearly applies by analogy the terms strong and weak were extended to the corresponding noun classes with a-stem and -stem nouns termed strong and n-stem nouns termed weak however in proto-germanic and still in gothic the most conservative germanic language the terms strong and weak are not clearly appropriate for one thing there were a large number of noun declensions the a-stem -stem and n-stem declensions were the most common and represented targets into which the other declensions were eventually absorbed but this process occurred only gradually originally the n-stem declension was not a single declension but a set of separate declensions e g -an - n - n with related endings and these endings were in no way any weaker than the endings of any other declensions for example among the eight possible inflectional categories of a noun singular plural crossed with nominative accusative dative genitive masculine an-stem nouns in gothic include seven endings and feminine n-stem nouns include six endings meaning there is very little ambiguity of weakness in these endings and in fact much less than in the german strong endings although it is possible to group the various noun declensions into three basic categories vowel-stem n-stem and other-consonant-stem a k a minor declensions the vowel-stem nouns do not display any sort of unity in their endings that supports grouping them together with each other but separate from the n-stem endings it is only in later languages that the binary distinction between strong and weak nouns become more relevant in old english the n-stem nouns form a single clear class but the masculine a-stem and feminine -stem nouns have little in common with each other and neither has much similarity to the small class of u-stem nouns similarly in old norse the masculine a-stem and feminine -stem nouns have little in common with each other and the continuations of the masculine an-stem and feminine n n-stem nouns are also quite distinct it is only in middle dutch and modern german that the various vowel-stem nouns have merged to the point that a binary strong weak distinction clearly applies as a result newer grammatical descriptions of the germanic languages often avoid the terms strong and weak except in conjunction with german itself preferring instead to use the terms indefinite and definite for adjectives and to distinguish nouns by their actual stem class in english both two sets of adjective endings were lost entirely in the late middle english period classification edit note that divisions between and among subfamilies of germanic are rarely precisely defined most form continuous clines with adjacent varieties being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not within the germanic language family is east germanic west germanic and north germanic however east germanic languages became extinct several centuries ago in some literature the west germanic grouping is also called south germanic or is further divided

germanic varieties developed the elder futhark an early form of the runic alphabet early runic inscriptions also are largely limited to personal names and difficult to interpret the gothic language was written in the gothic alphabet developed by bishop ulfilas for his translation of the bible in the 4th century 71 later christian priests and monks who spoke and read latin in addition to their native germanic varieties began writing the germanic languages with slightly modified latin letters however throughout the viking age runic alphabets remained in common use in scandinavia in addition to the standard latin script many germanic languages use a variety of accent marks and extra letters including the eszett and the latinized runes and with its latin counterpart w in print german used
