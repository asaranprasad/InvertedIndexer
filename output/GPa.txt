unit information unit system si derived unit unit of pressure or stress symbol pa named after blaise pascal unit conversions 1 pa in is equal to si base units kg m 1 s 2 us customary units 1.450 10 4 psi atmosphere 9.869 10 6 atm bar 10 5 bar the pascal symbol pa is the si derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure stress young s modulus and ultimate tensile strength it is defined as one newton per square metre 1 it is named after the french polymath blaise pascal common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal 1 hpa 100 pa which is equal to one millibar and the kilopascal 1 kpa 1000 pa which is equal to one centibar the unit of measurement called standard atmosphere atm is defined as 101325 pa 2 meteorological reports typically state atmospheric pressure in millibars contents 1 etymology 2 definition 3 standard units 4 uses 4.1 hectopascal and millibar units 5 see also 6 references 7 external links etymology edit the unit is named after blaise pascal noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics and experiments with a barometer the name pascal was adopted for the si unit newton per square metre n m2 by the 14th general conference on weights and measures in 1971 3 definition edit the pascal can be expressed using si derived units or alternatively solely si base units as 1 p a 1 n m 2 1 k g m s 2 j m 3 displaystyle rm 1 pa 1 frac n m 2 1 frac kg m cdot s 2 frac j m 3 where n is the newton m is the metre kg is the kilogram and s is the second 4 one pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of magnitude one newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metre standard units edit the unit of measurement called an atmosphere or a standard atmosphere atm is 101325 pa 101.325 kpa 5 this value is often used as a reference pressure and specified as such in some national and international standards such as the international organization for standardization s iso 2787 pneumatic tools and compressors iso 2533 aerospace and iso 5024 petroleum in contrast international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac recommends the use of 100 kpa as a standard pressure when reporting the properties of substances 6 unicode has dedicated code-points u 33a9 square pa and u 33aa square kpa in the cjk compatibility block but these exist only for backward-compatibility with some older ideographic character-sets and are therefore deprecated 7 8 uses edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed january 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message the pascal pa or kilopascal kpa as a unit of pressure measurement is widely used throughout the world and has largely replaced the pounds per square inch psi unit except in some countries that still use the imperial measurement system or the us customary system including the united states geophysicists use the gigapascal gpa in measuring or calculating tectonic stresses and pressures within the earth medical elastography measures tissue stiffness non-invasively with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging and often displays the young s modulus or shear modulus of tissue in kilopascals in materials science and engineering the pascal measures the stiffness tensile strength and compressive strength of materials in engineering use because the pascal represents a very small quantity the megapascal mpa is the preferred unit for these uses approximate young s modulus for common substances 9 material young s modulus nylon 6 2 4 gpa hemp fibre 35 gpa aluminium 69 gpa tooth enamel 83 gpa copper 117 gpa structural steel 200 gpa diamond 1220 gpa the pascal is also equivalent to the si unit of energy density j m3 this applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases but also to the energy density of electric magnetic and gravitational fields in measurements of sound pressure or loudness of sound one pascal is equal to 94 decibels spl the quietest sound a human can hear known as the threshold of hearing is 0 db spl or 20 pa the airtightness of buildings is measured at 50 pa 10 hectopascal and millibar units edit the units of atmospheric pressure commonly used in meteorology were formerly the bar which was close to the average air pressure on earth and the millibar since the introduction of si units meteorologists generally measure pressures in hectopascals hpa unit equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 exceptions include canada which use kilopascals kpa in many other fields of science the si is preferred which means pa with a prefix in multiples of 1000 is preferred 18 19 many countries also use the millibars in practically all other fields the kilopascal 1000 pascals is used instead citation needed see also edit centimetre of water metric prefix orders of magnitude pressure pascal s law references edit international bureau of weights and measures 2006 pdf
