extended crust oceanic crust 0 20 ma 20 65 ma 65 ma an orogeny is an event that leads to a large structural deformation of the earth s lithosphere crust and uppermost mantle due to the interaction between tectonic plates an orogen or orogenic belt develops when a continental plate crumples and is pushed upwards to form one or more mountain ranges this involves many geological processes collectively called orogenesis 1 2 orogeny is the primary mechanism by which mountains are built on continents citation needed the word orogeny comes from ancient greek oros mountain genesis for creation origin 3 though it was used before him the term was employed by the american geologist g k gilbert in 1890 to describe the process of mountain building as distinguished from epeirogeny 4

external links physiography edit two processes that can contribute to an orogen top delamination by intrusion of hot asthenosphere bottom subduction of ocean crust the two processes lead to differently located granites bubbles in diagram providing evidence as to which process actually occurred 5 subduction of an oceanic plate by a continental plate to form a noncollisional orogen example the andes continental collision of two continental plates to form a collisional orogen however usually no continental crust is subducted only uplifted example the alps formation of an orogen is accomplished in part by the tectonic processes of subduction where a continent rides forcefully over an oceanic plate noncollisional orogens or convergence of two or more continents collisional orogens 6 orogeny usually produces long arcuate from the latin arcuare to bend like a bow structures known as orogenic belts generally orogenic belts consist of long parallel strips of rock exhibiting similar characteristics along the length of the belt orogenic belts are associated with subduction zones which consume crust produce volcanoes and build island arcs 7 geologists attribute the arcuate structure to the rigidity of the descending plate and island arc cusps relate to tears in the descending lithosphere 8 these island arcs may be added to a continent during an orogenic event the processes of orogeny can take tens of millions of years and build mountains from plains or from the seabed the topographic height of orogenic mountains is related to the principle of isostasy 9 that is a balance of the downward gravitational force upon an upthrust mountain range composed of light continental crust material and the buoyant upward forces exerted by the dense underlying mantle 10 frequently rock formations that undergo orogeny are severely deformed and undergo metamorphism orogenic processes may push deeply buried rocks to the surface sea-bottom and near-shore material may cover some or all of the orogenic area if the orogeny is due to two continents colliding very high mountains can result see himalayas an orogenic event may be studied a as a tectonic structural event b as a geographical event and c as a chronological event orogenic events cause distinctive structural phenomena related to tectonic activity affect rocks and crust in particular regions and happen within a specific period orogen or orogenic system edit the foreland basin system an orogeny produces an orogen or mountain range-foreland basin system the foreland basin forms ahead of the orogen due mainly to loading and resulting flexure of the lithosphere by the developing mountain belt a typical foreland basin is subdivided into a wedge-top basin above the active orogenic wedge the foredeep immediately beyond the active front a forebulge high of flexural origin and a back-bulge area beyond although not all of these are present in all foreland-basin systems the basin migrates with the orogenic front and early deposited foreland basin sediments become progressively involved in folding and thrusting sediments deposited in the foreland basin are mainly derived from the erosion of the actively uplifting rocks of the mountain range although some sediments derive from the foreland the fill of many such basins shows a change in time from deepwater marine flysch-style through shallow water to continental molasse-style sediments 11 orogenic cycle edit although orogeny involves plate tectonics the tectonic forces result in a variety of associated phenomena including magmatism metamorphism crustal melting and crustal thickening what exactly happens in a specific orogen depends upon the strength and rheology of the continental lithosphere and how these properties change during orogenesis in addition to orogeny the orogen once formed is subject to other processes such as sedimentation and erosion 2 the sequence of repeated cycles of sedimentation deposition and erosion followed by burial and metamorphism and then by formation of granitic batholiths and tectonic uplift to form mountain chains is called the orogenic cycle 12 13 for example the caledonian orogeny refers to the silurian and devonian events that resulted from the collision of laurentia with eastern avalonia and other former fragments of gondwana the caledonian orogen resulted from these events and various others that are part of its peculiar orogenic cycle 14 in summary an orogeny is a long-lived deformational episode during which many geological phenomena play a role the orogeny of an orogen is only part of the orogen s orogenic cycle erosion edit erosion represents a subsequent phase of the orogenic cycle erosion inevitably removes much of the mountains exposing the core or mountain roots metamorphic rocks brought to the surface from a depth of several kilometres isostatic movements may help such exhumation by balancing out the buoyancy of the evolving orogen scholars debate about the extent to which erosion modifies the patterns of tectonic deformation see erosion and tectonics thus the final form of the majority of old orogenic belts is a long arcuate strip of crystalline metamorphic rocks sequentially below younger sediments which are thrust atop them and which dip away from the orogenic core an orogen may be almost completely eroded away and only recognizable by studying old rocks that bear traces of orogenesis orogens are usually long thin arcuate tracts of rock that have a pronounced linear structure resulting in terranes or blocks of deformed rocks separated generally by suture zones or dipping thrust faults these thrust faults carry relatively thin slices of rock which are called nappes or thrust sheets and differ from tectonic plates from the core of the shortening orogen out toward the margins and are intimately associated with folds and the development of metamorphism 15 biology edit in the 1950s and 1960s the study of orogeny coupled with biogeography the study of the distribution and evolution of flora and fauna 16 geography and mid ocean ridges contributed greatly to the theory of plate tectonics even at a very early stage life played a significant role in the continued existence of oceans by affecting the composition of the atmosphere the existence of oceans is critical to sea-floor spreading and subduction

madison limestone repeated with one example in the foreground that pinches out with distance and another to the upper right corner and top of the picture sierra nevada mountains a result of delamination as seen from the international space station mountain formation occurs through a number of mechanisms 19 20 21 mountain complexes result from irregular successions of tectonic responses due to sea-floor spreading shifting lithosphere plates transform faults and colliding coupled and uncoupled continental margins peter j coney 22 large modern orogenies often lie on the margins of present-day continents the alleghenian appalachian laramide and andean orogenies exemplify this in the americas older inactive orogenies such as the algoman penokean and antler are represented by deformed rocks and sedimentary basins further inland areas that are rifting apart such as mid-ocean ridges and the east african rift have mountains due to thermal buoyancy related to the hot mantle underneath them this thermal buoyancy is known as dynamic topography in strike-slip orogens such as the san andreas fault restraining bends result in regions of localized crustal shortening and mountain building without a plate-margin-wide orogeny hotspot volcanism results in the formation of isolated mountains and mountain chains that are not necessarily on tectonic-plate boundaries regions can also experience uplift as a result of delamination of the lithosphere in which an unstable portion of cold lithospheric root drips down into the mantle decreasing the density of the lithosphere and causing buoyant uplift 23 an example is the sierra nevada in california this range of fault-block mountains 24 experienced renewed uplift after a delamination of the lithosphere beneath them 23 25 finally uplift and erosion related to epeirogenesis large-scale vertical motions of portions of continents without much associated folding metamorphism or deformation 26 can create local topographic highs mount rundle banff alberta mount rundle on the trans-canada highway between banff and canmore provides a classic example of a mountain cut in dipping-layered rocks millions of years ago a collision caused an orogeny forcing horizontal layers of an ancient ocean crust to be thrust up at an angle of 50 60 that left rundle with one sweeping tree-lined smooth face and one sharp steep face where the edge of the uplifted layers are exposed 27 history of the concept edit before the development of geologic concepts during the 19th century the presence of marine fossils in mountains was explained in christian contexts as a result of the biblical deluge this was an extension of neoplatonic thought which influenced early christian writers citation needed the 13th-century dominican scholar albert the great posited that as erosion was known to occur there must be some process whereby new mountains and other land-forms were thrust up or else there would eventually be no land he suggested that marine fossils in mountainsides must once have been at the sea-floor orogeny was used by amanz gressly 1840 and jules thurmann 1854 as orogenic in terms of the creation of mountain elevations as the term mountain building was still used to describe the processes elie de beaumont 1852 used the evocative jaws of a vise theory to explain orogeny but was more concerned with the height rather than the implicit structures created by and contained in orogenic belts his theory essentially held that mountains were created by the squeezing of certain rocks eduard suess 1875 recognised the importance of horizontal movement of rocks the concept of a precursor geosyncline or initial downward warping of the solid earth hall 1859 prompted james dwight dana 1873 to include the concept of compression in the theories surrounding mountain-building with hindsight we can discount dana s conjecture that this contraction was due to the cooling of the earth aka the cooling earth theory the cooling earth theory was the chief paradigm for most geologists until the 1960s it was in the context of orogeny fiercely contested by proponents of vertical movements in the crust similar to tephrotectonics or convection within the asthenosphere or mantle gustav steinmann 1906 recognised different classes of orogenic belts including the alpine type orogenic belt typified by a flysch and molasse geometry to the sediments ophiolite sequences tholeiitic basalts and a nappe style fold structure in terms of recognising orogeny as an event leopold von buch 1855 recognised that orogenies could be placed in time by bracketing between the youngest deformed rock and the oldest undeformed rock a principle which is still in use today though commonly investigated by geochronology using radiometric dating h j zwart 1967 28 drew attention to the metamorphic differences in orogenic belts proposing three types modified by w s pitcher in 1979 29 and further modified as citation needed hercynotype back-arc basin type shallow low-pressure metamorphism thin metamorphic zones metamorphism dependent on increase in temperature abundant granite and migmatite few ophiolites ultramafic rocks virtually absent very wide orogen with small and slow uplift nappe structures rare alpinotype ocean trench style deep high pressure thick metamorphic zones metamorphism of many facies dependent on decrease in pressure few granites or migmatites abundant ophiolites with ultramafic rocks relatively narrow orogen with large and rapid uplift nappe structures predominant cordilleran arc type dominated by calc-alkaline igneous rocks andesites granite batholiths general lack of migmatites low geothermal gradient lack of ophiolite and abyssal sedimentary rocks black shale chert etcetera low-pressure metamorphism moderate uplift lack of nappes the advent of plate tectonics has explained the vast majority of orogenic belts and their features the cooling earth theory principally advanced by descartes is dispensed with and tephrotectonic style vertical movements have been explained primarily by the process of isostasy some oddities exist where simple collisional tectonics are modified in a transform plate boundary such as in new zealand or where island arc orogenies for instance in new guinea occur away from a continental backstop further complications such as proterozoic continent-continent collisional orogens explicitly the musgrave block in australia previously inexplicable 30 are being brought to light with the advent of seismic imaging techniques which can resolve
