national park service website death valley national park is a national park in the united states straddling the border of california and nevada located east of the sierra nevada it occupies an interface zone between the arid great basin and mojave deserts in the united states the park protects the northwest corner of the mojave desert and contains a diverse desert environment of salt-flats sand dunes badlands valleys canyons and mountains it is the largest national park in the lower 48 states and has been declared an international biosphere reserve approximately 91 of the park is a designated wilderness area 4 it is the hottest driest and lowest of the national parks in the united states 5 the second-lowest point in the western hemisphere is in badwater basin which is 282 feet 86 m below sea level the park is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh desert environment some examples include creosote bush bighorn sheep coyote and the death valley pupfish a survivor from much wetter times a series of native american groups inhabited the area from as early as 7000 bc most recently the timbisha around 1000 ad who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains a group of european-americans that became stuck in the valley in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the gold fields of california gave the valley its name even though only one of their group died there several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver the only long-term profitable ore to be mined was borax which was transported out of the valley with twenty-mule teams the valley later became the subject of books radio programs television series and movies tourism blossomed in the 1920s when resorts were built around stovepipe wells and furnace creek death valley national monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994 2 the natural environment of the area has been shaped largely by its geology the valley itself is actually a graben the oldest rocks are extensively metamorphosed and at least 1.7 billion years old 6 ancient warm shallow seas deposited marine sediments until rifting opened the pacific ocean additional sedimentation occurred until a subduction zone formed off the coast this uplifted the region out of the sea and created a line of volcanoes later the crust started to pull apart creating the current basin and range landform valleys filled with sediment and during the wet times of glacial periods with lakes such as lake manly in 2013 death valley national park was designated as a dark sky park by the international dark-sky association 7 contents 1 geographic setting 2

geographic setting edit there are two major valleys in the park death valley and panamint valley both of these valleys were formed within the last few million years and both are bounded by north south-trending mountain ranges 8 these and adjacent valleys follow the general trend of basin and range topography with one modification there are parallel strike-slip faults that perpendicularly bound the central extent of death valley the result of this shearing action is additional extension in the central part of death valley which causes a slight widening and more subsidence there uplift of surrounding mountain ranges and subsidence of the valley floor are both occurring the uplift on the black mountains is so fast that the alluvial fans fan-shaped deposits at the mouth of canyons there are small and steep compared to the huge alluvial fans coming off the panamint range fast uplift of a mountain range in an arid environment often does not allow its canyons enough time to cut a classic v-shape all the way down to the stream bed instead a v-shape ends at a slot canyon halfway down forming a wine glass canyon sediment is deposited on a small and steep alluvial fan at 282 feet 86 m below sea level at its lowest point 9 badwater basin on death valley s floor is the second-lowest depression in the western hemisphere behind laguna del carb n in argentina while mount whitney only 85 miles 137 km to the west rises to 14,505 feet 4,421 m 8 this topographic relief is the greatest elevation gradient in the contiguous united states and is the terminus point of the great basin s southwestern drainage 6 although the extreme lack of water in the great basin makes this distinction of little current practical use it does mean that in wetter times the lake that once filled death valley lake manly was the last stop for water flowing in the region meaning the water there was saturated in dissolved materials thus the salt pans in death valley are among the largest in the world and are rich in minerals such as borax and various salts and hydrates 10 the largest salt pan in the park extends 40 miles 64 km from the ashford mill site to the salt creek hills covering some 200 square miles 520 km2 of the valley floor 10 note 1 the best known playa in the park is the racetrack known for its moving rocks map of the park showing old monument land light green and the expanded

elevation sign and scenery desert and abandoned radiator water tank near grapevine climate edit a slice through the highest and lowest points in death valley national park death valley is the hottest and driest place in north america due to its lack of surface water and low relief it is so frequently the hottest spot in the united states that many tabulations of the highest daily temperatures in the country omit death valley as a matter of course 11 12 on the afternoon of july 10 1913 the united states weather bureau recorded a high temperature of 134 f 56.7 c at greenland ranch now furnace creek in death valley 13 this temperature stands as the highest ambient air temperature ever recorded at the surface of the earth a report of a temperature of 58 c 136.4 f recorded in libya in 1922 was later determined to be inaccurate 14 daily summer temperatures of 120 f 49 c or greater are common as well as below freezing nightly temperatures in the winter 6 july is the hottest month with an average high of 115 f 46 c and an average low of 88 f 31 c 15 december is the coldest month with an average high of 65 f 18 c and an average low of 39 f 4 c 15 the record low is 15 f 9.4 c 15 several of the larger death valley springs derive their water from a regional aquifer which extends as far east as southern nevada and utah much of the water in this aquifer has been there for many thousands of years since the pleistocene ice ages when the climate was cooler and wetter today s drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to recharge the aquifer at the rate at which water is being withdrawn 16 devil s golf course the highest range within the park is the panamint range with telescope peak being its highest point at 11,049 feet 3,368 m 6 the death valley region is a transitional zone in the northernmost part of the mojave desert and consists of five mountain ranges removed from the pacific ocean three of these are significant barriers the sierra nevada the argus range and the panamint range air masses tend to lose moisture as they are forced up over mountain ranges in what climatologists call a rainshadow effect the exaggerated rainshadow effect for the death valley area makes it north america s driest spot receiving about 1.5 inches 38 mm of rainfall annually at badwater some years fail to register any measurable rainfall 17 annual average precipitation varies from 1.92 inches 49 mm overall below sea level to over 15 inches 380 mm in the higher mountains that surround the valley 15 when rain does arrive it often does so in intense storms that cause flash floods which remodel the landscape and sometimes create very shallow ephemeral lakes 18 lake badwater spring 2005 the hot dry climate makes it difficult for soil to form mass wasting the down-slope movement of loose rock is therefore the dominant erosive force in mountainous area resulting in skeletonized ranges mountains with very little soil on them sand dunes in the park while famous are not nearly as widespread as their fame or the dryness of the area may suggest the mesquite flat dune field is the most easily accessible from the paved road just east of stovepipe wells in the north-central part of the valley and is primarily made of quartz sand another dune field is just 10 miles 16 km to the north but is instead mostly composed of travertine sand 19 the highest dunes in the park and some of the highest in north america are located in the eureka valley about 50 miles 80 km to the north of stovepipe wells while the panamint valley dunes and the saline valley dunes are located west and northwest of the town respectively the ibex dune field is near the seldom-visited ibex hill in the southernmost part of the park just south of the saratoga springs marshland all of the latter four dune fields are accessible only via unpaved roads prevailing winds in the winter come from the north and prevailing winds in the summer come from the south thus the overall position of the dune fields remains more or less fixed there are rare exceptions to the dry nature of the area in 2005 an unusually wet winter created a lake in the badwater basin and led to the greatest wildflower season in the park s history 20 in october 2015 a 1000 year flood event with over three inches of rain caused major damage in death valley national park 21 climate data for death valley furnace creek station month

mesquite springs early inhabitants and transient populations edit four native american cultures are known to have lived in the area during the last 10,000 years 6 the first known group the nevares spring people were hunters and gatherers who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000 years ago 7000 bc when there were still small lakes in death valley and neighboring panamint valley 25 a much milder climate persisted at that time and large game animals were still plentiful by 5,000 years ago 3000 bc the mesquite flat people displaced the nevares spring people 25 around 2,000 years ago the saratoga spring people moved into the area which by then was probably already a hot dry desert 25 note 2 this culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at handcrafts they also left mysterious stone patterns in the valley one-thousand years ago the nomadic timbisha formerly called shoshone and also known as panamint or koso moved into the area and hunted game and gathered mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts 6 25 because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges especially on the west the timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern 6 their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms as the spring and summer progressed and the weather warmed grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes november found them at the very top of the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter the california gold rush brought the first people of european descent known to visit the immediate area in december 1849 two groups of california gold country-bound white travelers with perhaps 100 wagons total stumbled into death valley after getting lost on what they thought was a shortcut off the old spanish trail 26 called the bennett-arcane party they were unable to find a pass out of the valley for weeks they were able to find fresh water at various springs in the area but were forced to eat several of their oxen to survive they used the wood of their wagons to cook the meat and make jerky the place where they did this is today referred to as burned wagons camp and is located near the sand dunes citation needed after abandoning their wagons they eventually were able to hike out of the valley just after leaving the valley one of the women in the group turned and said goodbye death valley giving the valley they endured its name 26 included in the party was william lewis manly whose autobiographical book death valley in 49 detailed this trek and popularized the area geologists later named the prehistoric lake that once filled the valley after him a twenty-mule team in death valley historical locomotive for borax-carrying in death valley furnace-creek-museum usa in june 1993 skidoo in 1906 scotty s castle under construction civilian conservation corps workers in death valley twenty-mule team canyon death valley boom and bust edit the ores that are most famously associated with the area were also the easiest to collect and the most profitable evaporite deposits such as salts borate and talc borax was found by rosie and aaron winters near the ranch at death valley then called greenland in 1881 27 later that same year the eagle borax works became death valley s first commercial borax operation william tell coleman built the harmony borax works plant and began to process ore in late 1883 or early 1884 continuing until 1888 28 this mining and smelting company produced borax to make soap and for industrial uses 29 the end product was shipped out of the valley 165 miles 266 km to the mojave railhead in 10-ton-capacity wagons pulled by twenty-mule teams that were actually teams of 18 mules and two horses each 29 the teams averaged two miles 3 km an hour and required about 30 days to complete a round trip 27 the trade name 20-mule team borax was established by francis marion smith s pacific coast borax company after smith acquired coleman s borax holdings in 1890 a memorable advertising campaign used the wagon s image to promote the boraxo brand of granular hand soap and the death valley days radio and television programs in 1914 the death valley railroad was built to serve mining operations on the east side of the valley mining continued after the collapse of coleman s empire and by the late 1920s the area was the world s number one source of borax 6 some four to six million years old the furnace creek formation is the primary source of borate minerals gathered from death valley s playas 27 other visitors stayed to prospect for and mine deposits of copper gold lead and silver 6 these sporadic mining ventures were hampered by their remote location and the harsh desert environment in december 1903 two men from ballarat were prospecting for silver 30 one was an out-of-work irish miner named jack keane and the other was a one-eyed basque butcher named domingo etcharren quite by accident keane discovered an immense ledge of free-milling gold by the duo s work site and named the claim the keane wonder mine this started a minor and short-lived gold rush into the area 30 the keane wonder mine along with mines at rhyolite skidoo and harrisburg were the only ones to extract enough metal ore to make them worthwhile outright shams such as leadfield also occurred but most ventures quickly ended after a short series of prospecting mines failed to yield evidence of significant ore these mines now dot the entire area and are a significant hazard to anyone who enters them the boom towns which sprang up around these mines flourished during the 1900s decade but soon declined after the panic of 1907 28 early tourism edit the first documented tourist facilities in death valley were a set of tent houses built in the 1920s where stovepipe wells is now located people flocked to resorts built around natural springs thought to have curative and restorative properties in 1927 pacific coast borax turned the crew quarters of its furnace creek ranch into a resort creating the furnace creek inn and resort 31 the spring at furnace creek was harnessed to develop the resort and as the water was diverted the surrounding marshes and wetlands started to shrink 16 soon the valley was a popular winter destination other facilities started off as private getaways but were later opened to the public most notable among these was death valley ranch better known as scotty s castle this large ranch home built in the spanish revival style became a hotel in the late 1930s and largely because of the fame of death valley scotty a tourist attraction death valley scotty whose real name was walter scott was a gold miner who pretended to be owner of his castle which he claimed to have built with profits from his gold mine neither claim was true but the real owner chicago millionaire albert mussey johnson encouraged the myth when asked by reporters what his connection was to walter scott s castle johnson replied that he was mr scott s banker 32 protection and later history edit this section needs

president herbert hoover proclaimed a national monument in and around death valley on february 11 1933 setting aside almost two million acres 8,000 km2 of southeastern california and small parts of southwesternmost nevada 33 twelve companies worked in death valley using civilian conservation corps workers during the great depression and on into the early 1940s they built barracks graded 500 miles 800 km of roads installed water and telephone lines and erected a total of 76 buildings trails in the panamint range were built to points of scenic interest and an adobe village laundry and trading post were constructed for shoshone native americans five campgrounds restrooms an airplane landing field and picnic facilities were also built 34 creation of the monument resulted in a temporary closing of the lands to prospecting and mining however death valley was quickly reopened to mining by congressional action in june of the same year as improvements in mining technology allowed lower grades of ore to be processed and new heavy equipment allowed greater amounts of rock to be moved mining in death valley changed gone were the days of the single-blanket jackass prospector long associated with the romantic west open pit and strip mines scarred the landscape as international mining corporations bought claims in highly visible areas of the national monument the public outcry that ensued led to greater protection for all national park and monument areas in the united states 28 abandoned mine shaft at leadfield in 1976 congress passed the mining in the parks act which closed death valley national monument to the filing of new mining claims banned open-pit mining and required the national park service to examine the validity of tens of thousands of pre-1976 mining claims mining was allowed to resume on a limited basis in 1980 with stricter environmental standards 28 the park s resources management division monitors mining within park boundaries and continues to review the status of 19 patented mining claim groups and less than 10 unpatented mining claims while ensuring that federal guidelines are followed and the park s resources are protected in 2005 the billie mine an underground borax mine located along the road to dante s view closed ending mining in the park 28 death valley national monument was designated a biosphere reserve in 1984 2 on october 31 1994 the monument was expanded by 1.3 million acres 5,300 km2 and re-designated as a national park via congressional passage of the california desert protection act public law 103-433 2 consequently the elevated status for death valley made it the largest national park in the contiguous united states many of the larger cities and towns within the boundary of the regional ground water flow system that the park and its plants and animals rely upon are experiencing some of the fastest growth rates of any place in the united states notable examples within a 100-mile 160 km radius of death valley national park include las vegas and pahrump nevada in the case of las vegas the local chamber of commerce estimates that 6,000 people are moving to the city every month between 1985 and 1995 the population of the las vegas valley increased from 550,700 to 1,138,800 16 telescope and wildrose peaks from emigrant canyon rd in 1977 parts of death valley were used by

radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700 million years for the metamorphism during the proterozoic 6 about 1,400 million years ago a mass of granite now in the panamint range intruded this complex 37 uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500 million years of erosion 37 the proterozoic sedimentary formations of the pahrump group were deposited on these basement rocks this occurred following uplift and erosion of any earlier sediments from the proterozoic basement rocks the pahrump is composed of arkose conglomerate quartz clasts in a concrete-like matrix and mudstone in its lower part followed by dolomite from carbonate banks topped by algal mats as stromatolites and finished with basin-filling sediment derived from the above including possible glacial till from the hypothesized snowball earth glaciation 38 the very youngest rocks in the pahrump group are basaltic lava flows the noonday dolomite was formed as a carbonate shelf after the break-up of rodinia rifting and

were also laid down citation needed stretching and lakes edit basin and range-associated stretching of large parts of crust below southwestern united states and northwestern mexico started around 16 million years ago and the region is still spreading 6 this stretching began to affect the death and panamint valleys area by 3 million years ago 43 before this rocks now in the panamint range were on top of rocks that would become the black mountains and the cottonwood mountains lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and at the base of the ranges also helped to develop the area 44 torsional forces probably associated with northwesterly movement of the pacific plate along the san andreas fault west of the region is responsible for the lateral movement 43 igneous activity associated with this stretching occurred from 12 million to 4 million years ago 44 sedimentation is concentrated in valleys basins from material eroded from adjacent ranges the amount of sediment deposited has roughly kept up with this subsidence resulting in retention of more or less the same valley floor elevation over time citation needed pleistocene ice ages started 2 million years ago and melt from alpine glaciers on the nearby sierra nevada mountains fed a series of lakes that filled death and panamint valleys and surrounding basins see the top of the timescale image the lake that filled death valley was the last of a chain of lakes fed by the amargosa and mojave rivers and possibly also the owens river the large lake that covered much of death valley s floor which geologists call lake manly started to dry up 10,500 years ago 45 saltpans and playas were created as ice age glaciers retreated thus drastically reducing the lakes water source only faint shorelines are left biology edit habitat varies from saltpan at 282 feet 86 m below sea level to the
