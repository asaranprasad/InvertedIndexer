marine species just those that are readily fossilized the labels of the traditional big five extinction events and the more recently recognised end-capitanian extinction event are clickable hyperlinks source and image info an extinction event also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on earth such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms it occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation because most diversity and biomass on earth is microbial and thus difficult to measure recorded extinction events affect the easily observed biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life 1 extinction occurs at an uneven rate based on the fossil record the background rate of extinctions on earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine animals every million years marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to land animals the great oxygenation event was probably the first major extinction event since the cambrian explosion five further major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate the most recent and arguably best-known the cretaceous paleogene extinction event which occurred approximately 66 million years ago ma was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time 2 in addition to the five major mass extinctions there are numerous minor ones as well and the ongoing mass extinction caused by human activity is sometimes called the sixth extinction 3 mass extinctions seem to be a mainly phanerozoic phenomenon with extinction rates low before large complex organisms arose 4 estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty these differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as major and the data chosen to measure past diversity contents 1 major extinction events 2 list of

until the permian triassic extinction event wiped them all out in a landmark paper published in 1982 jack sepkoski and david m raup identified five mass extinctions they were originally identified as outliers to a general trend of decreasing extinction rates during the phanerozoic 5 but as more stringent statistical tests have been applied to the accumulating data it has been established that multicellular animal life has experienced five major and many minor mass extinctions 6 the big five cannot be so clearly defined but rather appear to represent the largest or some of the largest of a relatively smooth continuum of extinction events 5 ordovician silurian extinction events end ordovician or o s 450 440 ma at the ordovician silurian transition two events occurred that killed off 27 of all families 57 of all genera and 60 to 70 of all species 7 together they are ranked by many scientists as the second largest of the five major extinctions in earth s history in terms of percentage of genera that became extinct late devonian extinction 375 360 ma near the devonian carboniferous transition at the end of the frasnian age in the later part s of the devonian period a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19 of all families 50 of all genera 7 and at least 70 of all species 8 this extinction event lasted perhaps as long as 20 million years and there is evidence for a series of extinction pulses within this period permian triassic extinction event end permian 252 ma at the permian triassic transition 9 earth s largest extinction killed 57 of all families 83 of all genera and 90 to 96 of all species 7 53 of marine families 84 of marine genera about 96 of all marine species and an estimated 70 of land species 2 including insects 10 the highly successful marine arthropod the trilobite became extinct the evidence regarding plants is less clear but new taxa became dominant after the extinction 11 the great dying had enormous evolutionary significance on land it ended the primacy of mammal-like reptiles the recovery of vertebrates took 30 million years 12 but the vacant niches created the opportunity for archosaurs to become ascendant in the seas the percentage of animals that were sessile dropped from 67 to 50 the whole late permian was a difficult time for at least marine life even before the great dying triassic jurassic extinction event end triassic 201.3 ma at the triassic jurassic transition about 23 of all families 48 of all genera 20 of marine families and 55 of marine genera and 70 to 75 of all species became extinct 7 most non-dinosaurian archosaurs most therapsids and most of the large amphibians were eliminated leaving dinosaurs with little terrestrial competition non-dinosaurian archosaurs continued to dominate aquatic environments while non-archosaurian diapsids continued to dominate marine environments the temnospondyl lineage of large amphibians also survived until the cretaceous in australia e g koolasuchus cretaceous paleogene extinction event end cretaceous k pg extinction or formerly k t extinction 66 ma at the cretaceous maastrichtian paleogene danian transition interval 13 the event formerly called the cretaceous-tertiary or k t extinction or k t boundary is now officially named the cretaceous paleogene or k pg extinction event about 17 of all families 50 of all genera 7 and 75 of all species became extinct 14 in the seas all the ammonites plesiosaurs and mosasaurs disappeared and the percentage of sessile animals those unable to move about was reduced to about 33 all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct during that time 15 the boundary event was severe with a significant amount of variability in the rate of extinction between and among different clades mammals and birds the latter descended from theropod dinosaurs emerged as dominant large land animals despite the popularization of these five events there is no definite line separating them from other extinction events using different methods of calculating an extinction s impact can lead to other events featuring in the top five 16 the older the fossil record gets the more difficult it is to read this is because older fossils are harder to find as they are usually buried at a considerable depth dating older fossils is more difficult productive fossil beds are researched more than unproductive ones therefore leaving certain periods unresearched prehistoric environmental events can disturb the deposition process the preservation of fossils varies on land but marine fossils tend to be better preserved than their sought after land-based counterparts 17 it has been suggested that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods 18 however statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50 of the observed pattern citation needed and other evidence such as fungal spikes clarification needed provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real a quantification of the rock exposure of western europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling bias 19 research completed after the seminal 1982 paper has concluded that a sixth mass extinction event is ongoing 6 holocene extinction currently ongoing extinctions have occurred at over 1000 times the background extinction rate since 1900 20 21 the mass extinction is considered a result of human activity 22 23 24 more recent research has indicated that the end-capitanian extinction event likely constitutes a separate extinction event from the permian triassic extinction

axis scale million years orange labels ice ages also see human timeline and nature timeline mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on earth when dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another it is rarely because the new dominant group is superior to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one 48 49 for example mammaliformes almost mammals and then mammals existed throughout the reign of the dinosaurs but could not compete for the large terrestrial vertebrate niches which dinosaurs monopolized the end-cretaceous mass extinction removed the non-avian dinosaurs and made it possible for mammals to expand into the large terrestrial vertebrate niches ironically the dinosaurs themselves had been beneficiaries of a previous mass extinction the end-triassic which eliminated most of their chief rivals the crurotarsans another point of view put forward in the escalation hypothesis predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism conflict will be less likely to survive extinctions this is because the very traits that keep a species numerous and viable under fairly static conditions become a burden once population levels fall among competing organisms during the dynamics of an extinction event furthermore many groups which survive mass extinctions do not recover in numbers or diversity and many of these go into long-term decline and these are often referred to as dead clades walking 50 darwin was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions such as competition for food and space the struggle for existence were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment he expressed this in the origin of species species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes and the most import of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered physical conditions namely the mutual relation of organism to organism-the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of others 51 patterns in frequency edit it has been suggested variously that extinction events occurred periodically every 26 to 30 million years 52 53 or that diversity fluctuates episodically every 62 million years 54 various ideas attempt to explain the supposed pattern including the presence of a hypothetical companion star to the sun 55 56 oscillations in the galactic plane or passage through the milky way s spiral arms 57 however other authors have concluded the data on marine mass extinctions do not fit with the idea that mass extinctions are periodic or that ecosystems gradually build up to a point at which a mass extinction is inevitable 5 many of the proposed correlations have been argued to be spurious 58 59 others have argued that there is strong evidence supporting periodicity in a variety of records 60 and additional evidence in the form of coincident periodic variation in nonbiological geochemical variables 61 all genera well-defined genera trend line big five mass extinctions other mass extinctions million years ago thousands of genera phanerozoic biodiversity as shown by the fossil record mass extinctions are thought to result when a long-term stress is compounded by a short term shock 62 over the course of the phanerozoic individual taxa appear to be less likely to become extinct at any time 63 which may reflect more robust food webs as well as less extinction-prone species and other factors such as continental distribution 63 however even after accounting for sampling bias there does appear to be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the phanerozoic 5 this may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are more likely to become extinct by chance or it may be an artefact of taxonomy families tend to become more speciose therefore less prone to extinction over time 5 and larger taxonomic groups by definition appear earlier in geological time 64 it has also been suggested that the oceans have gradually become more hospitable to life over the last 500 million years and thus less vulnerable to mass extinctions note 1 65 66 but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level does not appear to make mass extinctions more or less probable 63 causes edit there is still debate about the causes of all mass extinctions in general large extinctions may result when a biosphere under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock 62 an underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates to diversity high diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate these presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations asteroid impacts etc to produce the global effects observed 5 identifying causes of particular mass extinctions edit a good theory for a particular mass extinction should i explain all of the losses not just focus on a few groups such as dinosaurs ii explain why particular groups of organisms died out and why others survived iii provide mechanisms which are strong enough to cause a mass extinction but not a total extinction iv be based on events or processes that can be shown to have happened not just inferred from the extinction it may be necessary to consider combinations of causes for example the marine aspect of the end-cretaceous extinction appears to have been caused by several processes which partially overlapped in time and may have had different levels of significance in different parts of the world 67 arens and west 2006 proposed a press pulse model in which mass extinctions generally require two types of cause long-term pressure on the eco-system press and a sudden catastrophe pulse towards the end of the period of pressure 68 their statistical analysis of marine extinction rates throughout the phanerozoic suggested that neither long-term pressure alone nor a catastrophe alone was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the extinction rate most widely supported explanations edit macleod 2001 69 summarized the relationship between mass extinctions and events which are most often cited as causes of mass extinctions using data from courtillot et al 1996 70 hallam 1992 71 and grieve et al 1996 72 flood basalt events 11 occurrences all associated with significant extinctions 73 74 but wignall 2001 concluded that only five of the major extinctions coincided with flood basalt eruptions and that the main phase of extinctions started before the eruptions 75 sea-level falls 12 of which seven were associated with significant extinctions 74 asteroid impacts one large impact is associated with a mass extinction i e the cretaceous paleogene extinction event there have been many smaller impacts but they are not associated with significant extinctions citation needed the most commonly suggested causes of mass extinctions are listed below flood basalt events edit the formation of large igneous provinces by flood basalt events could have produced dust and particulate aerosols which inhibited photosynthesis and thus caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea 76 emitted sulfur oxides which were precipitated as acid rain and poisoned many organisms contributing further to the collapse of food chains emitted carbon dioxide and thus possibly causing sustained global warming once the dust and particulate aerosols dissipated flood basalt events occur as pulses of activity punctuated by dormant periods as a result they are likely to cause the climate to oscillate between cooling and warming but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years it is speculated that massive volcanism caused or contributed to the end-permian end-triassic and end-cretaceous extinctions 77 the correlation between gigantic volcanic events expressed in the large igneous provinces and mass extinctions was shown for the last 260 myr 78 79 recently such possible correlation was extended for the whole phanerozoic eon 80 sea-level falls edit these are often clearly marked by worldwide sequences of contemporaneous sediments which show all or part of a transition from sea-bed to tidal zone to beach to dry land and where there is no evidence that the rocks in the relevant areas were raised by geological processes such as orogeny sea-level falls could reduce the continental shelf area the most productive part of the oceans sufficiently to cause a marine mass extinction and could disrupt weather patterns enough to cause extinctions on land but sea-level falls are very probably the result of other events such as sustained global cooling or the sinking of the mid-ocean ridges sea-level falls are associated with most of the mass extinctions including all of the big five end-ordovician late devonian end-permian end-triassic and end-cretaceous a study published in the journal nature online june 15 2008 established a relationship between the speed of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment 81 the study suggests changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans 82 impact events edit the impact of a sufficiently large asteroid or comet could have caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea by producing dust and particulate aerosols and thus inhibiting photosynthesis 83 impacts on sulfur-rich rocks could have emitted sulfur oxides precipitating as poisonous acid rain contributing further to the collapse of food chains such impacts could also have caused megatsunamis and or global forest fires most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the earth about 66 ma ago but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the cretaceous paleogene extinction event 84 85 global cooling edit sustained and significant global cooling could kill many polar and temperate species and force others to migrate towards the equator reduce the area available for tropical species often make the earth s climate more arid on average mainly by locking up more of the planet s water in ice and snow the glaciation cycles of the current ice age are believed to have had only a very mild impact on biodiversity so the mere existence of a significant cooling is not sufficient on its own to explain a mass extinction it has been suggested that global cooling caused or contributed to the end-ordovician permian triassic late devonian extinctions and possibly others sustained global cooling is distinguished from the temporary climatic effects of flood basalt events or impacts global warming edit this would have the opposite effects expand the area available for tropical species kill temperate species or force them to migrate towards the poles possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species often make the earth s climate wetter on average mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing the volume of the water cycle it might also cause anoxic events in the oceans see below global warming as a cause of mass extinction is supported by several recent studies 86 the most dramatic example of sustained warming is the paleocene eocene thermal maximum which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions it has also been suggested to have caused the triassic jurassic extinction event during which 20 of all marine families became extinct furthermore the permian triassic extinction event has been suggested to have been caused by warming 87 88 89 clathrate gun hypothesis edit clathrates are composites in which a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another methane clathrates in which water molecules are the cage form on continental shelves these clathrates are likely to break up rapidly and release the methane if the temperature rises quickly or the pressure on them drops quickly for example in response to sudden global warming or a sudden drop in sea level or even earthquakes methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide so a methane eruption clathrate gun could cause rapid global warming or make it much more severe if the eruption was itself caused by global warming the most likely signature of such a methane eruption would be a sudden decrease in the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in sediments since methane clathrates are low in carbon-13 but the change would have to be very large as other events can also reduce the percentage of carbon-13 90 it has been suggested that clathrate gun methane eruptions were involved in the end-permian extinction the great dying and in the paleocene eocene thermal maximum which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions anoxic events edit anoxic events are situations in which the middle and even the upper layers of the ocean become deficient or totally lacking in oxygen their causes are complex and controversial but all known instances are associated with severe and sustained global warming mostly caused by sustained massive volcanism 91 it has been suggested that anoxic events caused or contributed to the ordovician silurian late devonian permian triassic and triassic jurassic extinctions as well as a number of lesser extinctions such as the ireviken mulde lau toarcian and cenomanian turonian events on the other hand there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-cretaceous which indicate anoxic events but are not associated with mass extinctions the bio-availability of essential trace elements in particular selenium to potentially lethal lows has been shown to coincide with and likely have contributed to at least three mass extinction events in the oceans i e at the end of the ordovician during the middle and late devonian and at the end of the triassic during periods of low oxygen concentrations very soluble selenate se6 is converted into much less soluble selenide se2 elemental se and organo-selenium complexes bio-availability of selenium during these extinction events dropped to about 1 of the current oceanic concentration a level that has been proven lethal to many extant organisms 92 hydrogen sulfide emissions from the seas edit kump pavlov and arthur 2005 have proposed that during the permian triassic extinction event the warming also upset the oceanic balance between photosynthesising plankton and deep-water sulfate-reducing bacteria causing massive emissions of hydrogen sulfide which poisoned life on both land and sea and severely weakened the ozone layer exposing much of the life that still remained to fatal levels of uv radiation 93 94 95 oceanic overturn edit oceanic overturn is a disruption of thermo-haline circulation which lets surface water which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation sink straight down bringing anoxic deep water to the surface and therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms which inhabit the surface and middle depths it may occur either at the beginning or the end of a glaciation although an overturn at the start of a glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic water 96 unlike other oceanic catastrophes such as regressions sea-level falls and anoxic events overturns do not leave easily identified signatures in rocks and are theoretical consequences of researchers conclusions about other climatic and marine events it has been suggested that oceanic overturn caused or contributed to the late devonian and permian triassic extinctions a nearby nova supernova or gamma ray burst edit a nearby gamma-ray burst less than 6000 light-years away would be powerful enough to destroy the earth s ozone layer leaving organisms vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation from the sun 97 gamma ray bursts are fairly rare occurring only a few times in a given galaxy per million years 98 it has been suggested that a supernova or gamma ray burst caused the end-ordovician extinction 99 geomagnetic reversal edit one theory is that periods of increased geomagnetic reversals will weaken earth s magnetic field long enough to expose the atmosphere to the solar winds causing oxygen ions to escape the atmosphere in a rate increased by 3 4 orders resulting in a disastrous decrease in oxygen 100 plate tectonics edit movement of the continents into some configurations can cause or contribute to extinctions in several ways by initiating or ending ice ages by changing ocean and wind currents and thus altering climate by opening seaways or land bridges which expose previously isolated species to competition for which they are poorly adapted for example the extinction of most of south america s native ungulates and all of its large metatherians after the creation of a land bridge between north and south america occasionally continental drift creates a super-continent which includes the vast majority of earth s land area which in addition to the effects listed above is likely to reduce the total area of continental shelf the most species-rich part of the ocean and produce a vast arid continental interior which may have extreme seasonal variations another theory is that the creation of the super-continent pangaea contributed to the end-permian mass extinction pangaea was almost fully formed at the transition from mid-permian to late-permian and the marine genus diversity diagram at the top of this article shows a level of extinction starting at that time which might have qualified for inclusion in the big five if it were not overshadowed by the great dying at the end of the permian 101 other hypotheses edit many other hypotheses have been proposed such as the spread of a new disease or simple out-competition following an especially successful biological innovation but all have been rejected usually for one of the following reasons they require events or processes for which there is no evidence they assume mechanisms which are contrary to the available evidence they are based on other theories which have been rejected or superseded scientists have been concerned that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past along with human-made changes in climate see above some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting overfishing invasive species or habitat loss a study published in may 2017 in proceedings of the national academy of sciences argued that a biological annihilation akin to a sixth mass extinction event is underway as a result of anthropogenic causes such as over-population and over-consumption the study suggested that as much as 50 of the number of animal individuals that once lived on earth were already extinct threatening the basis for human existence too 102 24 future biosphere extinction edit the eventual warming and expanding of the sun combined with the eventual decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide could actually cause an even greater mass extinction having the potential to wipe out even microbes where rising global temperatures caused by the expanding sun will gradually increase the rate of weathering which in turn removes more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere when carbon dioxide levels get too low perhaps at 50 ppm all plant life will die out although simpler plants like grasses and mosses can survive much longer until co2 levels drop to 10 ppm 103 104 with all photosynthetic organisms gone atmospheric oxygen can no longer be replenished and is eventually removed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere perhaps from volcanic eruptions eventually the loss of oxygen will cause all remaining aerobic life to die out via asphyxiation leaving behind only simple anaerobic prokaryotes when the sun becomes 10 brighter in about a billion years 103 earth will suffer a moist greenhouse effect resulting in its oceans boiling away while the earth s liquid outer core cools due to the inner core s expansion and causes the earth s magnetic field to shut down in the absence of a magnetic field charged particles from the sun will deplete the atmosphere and further increase the earth s temperature to an average of 420 k 147 c 296 f in 2.8 billion years causing the last remaining life on earth to die out this is the most extreme instance of a climate-caused extinction event since this will only happen late in the sun s life such will cause the final mass extinction in earth s history albeit a very long extinction event 103 104 effects and recovery edit the impact of mass extinction events varied widely after a major extinction event usually only weedy species survive due to their ability to live in diverse habitats 105 later species diversify and occupy empty niches generally biodiversity recovers 5 to 10 million years after the extinction event in the most severe mass extinctions it may take 15 to 30 million years 105 the worst event the permian triassic extinction devastated life on earth killing over 90 of species life seemed to recover quickly after the p-t extinction but this was mostly in the form of disaster taxa such as the hardy lystrosaurus the most recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems with high biodiversity complex food webs and a variety of niches took much longer to recover it is thought that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction which inhibited recovery as well as prolonged environmental stress which continued into the early triassic recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-triassic 4m to 6m years after the extinction 106 and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30m years after the p-t extinction i e in the late triassic 107 subsequent to the p-t extinction there was an increase in provincialization with species occupying smaller ranges perhaps removing incumbents from niches and setting the stage for an eventual rediversification 108 the effects of mass extinctions on plants are somewhat harder to quantify given the biases inherent in the plant fossil record some mass extinctions such as the end-permian were equally catastrophic for plants whereas others such as the end-devonian did not affect the flora 109 see also edit human extinction bioevent elvis taxon endangered species global catastrophic risk geologic time scale holocene extinction ka k event lazarus taxon list of impact
