accounts this northern coastal area was originally called pak-kang chinese pe h- e-j pak-k ng 3 by the early 20th century the city was known to the western world as kelung 4 as well as the variants kiloung kilang and keelung 5 in his 1903 general history of taiwan us consul to formosa 1898 1904 james w davidson related that kelung was among the few well-known names thus warranting no alternate japanese romanization 6 however the taiwanese people have long called the city kelang chinese pe h- e-j ke-l ng koe-l ng literally rooster cage or hencoop 7 it has been proposed that this name was derived from the local mountain that took the shape of a rooster cage however it is more probable that the name was derived from the first inhabitants of the region as are the names of many other taiwanese cities in this case the ketagalan people were the first inhabitants and early han settlers probably approximated ketagalan with ke-l ng hokkien phonetics in 1875 during the late qing era a new official name was given chinese pinyin j l ng literally base prosperous 8 in mandarin probably the working language of chinese government at the time both the old and new names were likely pronounced k l ng hence keelung under japanese rule 1895 1945 the city was also known to the west by the japanese romanization k run also written as kirun or kiirun 9 in standard chinese which became the official language of taiwan after its handover to the republic of china the newer name is read j l ng the shift from initial k to j is a recent development in the beijing dialect see old mandarin however the locals continue to call the city ke-l ng across the changes in government 10 11 history edit map of keelung in 1856 keelung was first inhabited by the ketagalan a tribe of taiwanese aborigine the spanish expedition to formosa in the early 17th century was its first contact with the west by 1624 the spanish had built san salvador de quelung a fort in keelung serving as an outpost of the manila-based spanish east indies 12 the spanish ruled it as a part of spanish formosa from 1642 to 1661 and 1663 1668 keelung was under dutch control 13 14 the dutch east india company took over the spanish fort san salvador at santissima trinidad they reduced its size and renamed it fort noort-hollant 14 the dutch had three more minor fortifications in keelung and also a little school and a preacher kingdom of tungning edit when ming dynasty loyalist koxinga successfully attacked the dutch in southern taiwan siege of fort zeelandia the crew of the keelung forts fled to the dutch trading post in japan the dutch came back in 1663 and re-occupied and strengthened their earlier forts however trade with qing china through keelung was not what they hoped it would be and in 1668 they left after getting harassed by aboriginals 15 qing dynasty edit first opium war edit during the first opium war between the british empire and the chinese qing empire in the 1841 battle of keelung 1841-1842 the british attempted to attack in failed efforts three times against keelung on the northeast coast of taiwan under qing rule 16 17 18 19 attempts by the british to seize da an and keelung by the british failed 20 due to a successful defence led by the taotai yao ying who commanded the chinese naval forces on taiwan 21 indian and european crew members of the nerbudda a british ship were captured on taiwan after being abandoned by their british officers and were executed by local qing officials 22 portuguese indian american and european crew members of the ann another british ship were shipwrecked in the vicinity of tamsui in march 1842 captured and then executed by the chinese 23 24 at tainan 197 of the nerbudda and ann s crews were killed and due to causes related to imprisonment 87 others died 25 in 1863 the qing empire opened up keelung as a trading port and the city enjoyed rapid development due to the abundant commodities such as placer gold and high quality coal found in the drainage area of keelung river in 1875 taipeh prefecture was created and included keelung in 1878 keelung was formed into a ting or sub-prefecture 26 around the same time the name was changed from ke-lang to kilong which means rich and prosperous land 8 sino-french war edit during the sino-french war 1884 85 the french attempted an invasion of taiwan during the keelung campaign liu mingchuan who led the defence of taiwan recruited aboriginals to serve alongside the chinese soldiers in fighting against the french of colonel jacques duchesne s formosa expeditionary corps the french were defeated at the battle of tamsui and the qing forces pinned the french down at keelung in an eight-month-long campaign before the french withdrew empire of japan edit a systematic city development started during the japanese era after the 1895 treaty of shimonoseki which handed all taiwan over to japan a five-phase construction of keelung harbor was initiated and in by 1916 trade volume had exceeded even those of tamsui and kaohsiung harbors to become one of the major commercial harbors of taiwan 27 keelung was governed as k run town k run district taihoku prefecture in 1920 and was upgraded to a city in 1924 27 the pacific war broke out in 1941 and keelung became one of the first targets of allied bombers and was nearly destroyed as a result 27 republic of china edit after the withdrawal of the japanese taiwan became part of the republic of china roc in october 1945 keelung was established as a provincial city of taiwan province the keelung city government worked with the harbor bureau to rebuild the city and the harbor and in 1984 the harbor became the 7th largest container harbor in the world 28 geography edit keelung city is located in the northern part of taiwan island it occupies an area of 132.76 km2 and is separated from its neighboring county by mountains in the east west and south the northern part of the city faces the ocean and is a great deep water harbor since early times 29 climate edit keelung has a humid subtropical climate k ppen cfa with a yearly rainfall average upwards of 3,700 millimetres 146 in it has long been noted as one of the wettest and gloomiest cities in the world the effect is related to the kuroshio current 30 although it is one of the coolest cities of taiwan winters are still short and mild whilst summers are long relatively dry and hot temperatures can peek above 26 c during a warm winter day while it can dip below 27 c during a rainy summer day much like the rest of northern taiwan however its location on northern mountain slopes means that due to orographic lift rainfall is heavier during fall and winter the latter during which a northeasterly flow prevails during summer southwesterly winds dominate and thus there is a slight rain shadow effect fog is most serious during winter and spring when relative humidity levels are also highest climate data for keelung 1981
