https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon full moon from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the supermoon of 14 november 2016 was 356,511 km 221,526 mi away 1 from the center of earth the closest occurrence since 1948 it will not be closer again until 2034 2 the full moon as viewed through a 235 mm 9.25 in schmidt-cassegrain telescope the moon was near its northernmost ecliptic latitude so the southern craters are especially prominent the full moon during the total lunar eclipse of 28 september 2015 the full moon is the lunar phase when the moon appears fully illuminated from earth s perspective this occurs when earth is located directly between the sun and the moon more exactly when the ecliptic longitudes of the sun and moon differ by 180 this means that the lunar hemisphere facing earth the near side is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk while the far side is dark the full moon occurs once roughly every month when the moon moves into earth s shadow a lunar eclipse occurs during which all or part of the moon s face may appear reddish due to the rayleigh scattering of blue wavelengths and the refraction of sunlight through earth s atmosphere 3 4 5 lunar eclipses happen only during full moon and around points on its orbit where the satellite may pass through the planet s shadow a lunar eclipses does not occur every month because the moon s orbit is inclined 5.14 to the ecliptic plane thus the moon usually passes north or south of earth s shadow which is mostly restricted to this plane of reference lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either node of its orbit ascending or descending therefore a lunar eclipse occurs approximately every 6 months and often 2 weeks before or after a solar eclipse which occurs during new moon around the opposite node the interval period between a new or full moon and the next same phase a synodic month averages about 29.53 days therefore in those lunar calendars in which each month begins on the day of the new moon the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the lunar month because a calendar month consists of a whole number of days a lunar month may be either 29 or 30 days long contents 1 characteristics 1.1 formula 2 in folklore and tradition 2.1 full moon names 2.1.1 harvest and hunter s moons 2.1.2 farmers almanacs 2.2 hindu full moon

night s duration this is somewhat misleading because its phase seen from earth continuously waxes or wanes though much too slowly to notice in real time with the naked eye its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing has stopped for any given location about half of these maximum full moons may be visible while the other half occurs during the day when the full moon is below the horizon many almanacs list full moons not only by date but also by their exact time usually in coordinated universal time utc typical monthly calendars that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when used in a different time zone full moon is generally a suboptimal time to conduct astronomical observations because the bright sunlight reflected by the moon then outshines the apparently dimmer stars on 12 december 2008 the full moon occurred closer to the earth than it had been at any time for the previous 15 years called a supermoon 6 on 19 march 2011 another full supermoon occurred closer to the earth than at any time for the previous 18 years 7 on 14 november 2016 a full supermoon occurred closer to the earth than at any time for the previous 68 years 8 formula edit the date and approximate time of a specific full moon assuming a circular orbit can be calculated from the following equation 9 d 20.362000 29.530588861 n 102.026 10 12 n 2 displaystyle d 20.362000 29.530588861 times n 102.026 times 10 -12 times n 2 where d is the number of days since 1 january 2000 00 00 00 in the terrestrial time scale used in astronomical ephemerides for universal time ut add the following approximate correction to d 0.000739 235 10 12 n 2 displaystyle -0.000739- 235 times 10 -12 times n 2 days where n is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000 the true time of a full moon may differ from this approximation by up to about 14.5 hours as a result of the non-circularity of the moon s orbit 10 see new moon for an explanation of the formula and its parameters the age and apparent size of the full moon vary in a cycle of just under 14 synodic months which has been referred to as a full moon cycle in folklore and tradition edit full moon rising seen through the belt of venus full moons are traditionally associated with temporal insomnia inability to sleep insanity hence the terms lunacy and lunatic and various magical phenomena such as lycanthropy psychologists however have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon 11 they find that studies are generally not consistent with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect in one instance the 23 december 2000 issue of the british medical journal published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in england and australia the study of the bradford royal infirmary found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in australia found that they were less likely all this is relevant to canine rather than human behavior full moon names edit historically month names are names of moons lunations not necessarily full moons in lunisolar calendars since the introduction of the solar julian calendar in the roman empire and later the gregorian calendar worldwide people no longer perceive month names as moon names the traditional old english month names were equated with the names of the julian calendar from an early time soon after christianization according to the testimony of bede ca ad 700 some full moons have developed new names in modern times e g the blue moon and the names harvest moon and hunter s moon for the full moons of autumn harvest and hunter s moons edit a harvest moon its orange color is due to its closeness to the horizon rather than being unique to harvest moons 12 the harvest moon and hunter s moon are traditional terms for the full moons occurring during late summer and in the autumn in the northern hemisphere usually in september and october respectively the harvest moon is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox 22 or 23 september coming anywhere from two weeks before to two weeks after that date 13 the hunter s moon is the full moon following it the names are recorded from the early 18th century 14 the oxford english dictionary entry for harvest moon cites a 1706 reference and for hunter s moon a 1710 edition of the british apollo where the term is attributed to the country people the country people call this the hunters-moon the names became traditional in american folklore where they are now often popularly attributed to the native americans 15 the feast of the hunters moon is a yearly festival in west lafayette indiana held in late september or early october each year since 1968 16 in 2010 the harvest moon occurred on the night of equinox itself some 5 1 2 hours after the point of equinox for the first time since 1991 17 18 all full moons rise around the time of sunset because the moon moves eastward among the stars faster than the sun its meridian passage is delayed causing it to rise later each day on average by about 50.47 minutes 19 the harvest moon and hunter s moon are unique because the time difference between moonrises on successive evenings is much shorter than average the moon rises approximately 30 minutes later from one night to the next as seen from about 40 degrees n or s latitude this is because a full moon in september appears to move not straight east but north-east in the sky thus there is no long period of darkness between sunset and moonrise for several days following the actual date of the full moon 20 farmers almanacs edit the maine farmers almanac from c the 1930s began to publish native american indian full moon names the farmers almanac since 1955 published in maine but not the same publication as the maine farmers almanac continues to do so 21 an early list of indian month names was published in 1918 by daniel carter beard in his the american boy s book of signs signals and symbols for use by the boy scouts beard s indian month names were 22 january difficulty black smoke february raccoon bare spots on the ground march wind little grass sore-eye april ducks goose-eggs may green grass root-food june corn-planting strawberry july buffalo bull hot sun august harvest cow buffalo september wild rice red plum october leaf-falling nuts november deer-mating fur-pelts december wolves big moon such names have gained currency in american folklore they appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the moon mysteries of the moon by patricia haddock great mysteries series greenhaven press 1992 gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with 23 haddock supposes that certain colonial american moon names were adopted from algonquian languages which were formerly spoken in the territory of new england while others are based in european tradition e g the colonial american names for the may moon milk moon mother s moon hare moon have no parallels in the supposed native names while the name of november beaver moon is supposedly based in the algonquin the individual names given in farmers almanac include clarification needed january wolf moon this is the name of december in beard

hinduism most festivals are celebrated on auspicious days many of the hindu festivals are celebrated on days with a full moon at night different parts of india celebrate the same day with different names as listed below chaitra purnima - gudi padua yugadi ugadi hanuman jayanti april 15 2014 27 vaishakh purnima - narasimh jayanti buddha jayanthi may 14 2014 28 jyeshtha purnima - vat savitri vrat

december 2015 full moon coincided with christmas day 30 this last occurred in 1977 with a christmas eve full moon between in 1996 and a full moon the day after christmas in 2004 and before christmas eve in 2007 both not shown here a small horizontal libration is visible comparing their appearances by the 19-year metonic cycle the full moon will repeat on christmas day in 2034 2053 2072 and 2091 31 most pre-modern calendars the world over were lunisolar combining the solar year with the lunation by means of intercalary months 32 33 the julian calendar abandoned this method in favour of a purely solar reckoning while conversely the 7th-century islamic calendar opted for a purely lunar one a continuing lunisolar calendar is in the hebrew calendar evidence of this is noted in the dates of passover and easter in judaism and christianity respectively the date of the jewish rosh hashana and sukkot festivals along with all other jewish holidays are dependent on the dates of the new moons 34 intercalary months edit in lunisolar calendars an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the metonic cycle or on average every 2.7 years 19 7 in the hebrew calendar this is noted with a periodic extra month of adar in the early spring blue moon edit in the modern system of traditional full moon names tied to the solstice and equinox points a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon the term blue moon used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century but it became well known in the united states due to the farmers almanac published since 1818 35 according to the farmers almanac a blue moon is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox or between equinox and solstice calculated using the mean tropical year which contains four full moons 36 these seasons are equal in length unlike the astronomical ones which vary in length depending on the earth s speed in its elliptical orbit round the sun to compare in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1.48 am on 23 march 9.15 am on 22 june 4.42 pm on 21 september and 12.10 am on 22 december while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 am on 21 march 11.09 pm on 21 june 2.42 pm on 23 september and 10.30 am on 22 december all times gmt due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the march 1946 sky telescope magazine blue moon has also been used in the sense of the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons this usage has been noted as erroneous by sky telescope in 1999 37 according to either definition blue moons occur with the average frequency of intercalary months seven times in 19 years the farmers almanac system of full moon names effectively defining a lunisolar calendar see also edit lunar eclipse lunar phase
