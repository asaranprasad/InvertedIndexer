beaked jaws the laying of hard-shelled eggs a high metabolic rate a four-chambered heart and a strong yet lightweight skeleton birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm 2 in bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m 9 ft ostrich they rank as the world s most numerically-successful class of tetrapods with approximately ten thousand living species more than half of these being passerines sometimes known as perching birds birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds wings which evolved from forelimbs gave birds the ability to fly although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in flightless birds including ratites penguins and diverse endemic island species of birds the digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight some bird species of aquatic environments particularly seabirds and some waterbirds have further evolved for swimming the fossil record indicates that birds evolved from earlier feathered dinosaurs within the theropod group which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs their closest living relatives are the crocodilians primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class aves proper in the broader group avialae have been found dating back to the mid-jurassic period around 170 million years ago 1 many of these early stem-birds such as archaeopteryx were not yet capable of fully powered flight and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks and long bony tails 1 dna-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the cretaceous palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago which killed off the pterosaurs and all the non-avian dinosaur lineages but birds especially those in the southern continents survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling 3 this makes them the sole surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics 4 some birds especially corvids and parrots are among the most intelligent animals several bird species make and use tools and many social species pass on knowledge across generations which is considered a form of culture many species annually migrate great distances birds are social communicating with visual signals calls and bird songs and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting flocking and mobbing of predators the vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous referring to social living arrangement distinct from genetic monogamy usually for one breeding season at a time sometimes for years but rarely for life other species have breeding systems that are polygynous arrangement of one male with many females or rarely polyandrous arrangement of one female with many males birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction they are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching some birds such as hens lay eggs even when not fertilised though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing with domesticated and undomesticated birds poultry and game being important sources of eggs meat and feathers songbirds parrots and other species are popular as pets guano bird excrement is harvested for use as a fertiliser birds prominently figure throughout human culture about 120 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century and hundreds more before then human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with

links evolution and classification archaeopteryx lithographica is often considered the oldest known true bird the first classification of birds was developed by francis willughby and john ray in their 1676 volume ornithologiae 5 carl linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use 6 birds are categorised as the biological class aves in linnaean taxonomy phylogenetic taxonomy places aves in the dinosaur clade theropoda 7 definition aves and a sister group the clade crocodilia contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade archosauria during the late 1990s aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and archaeopteryx lithographica 8 however an earlier definition proposed by jacques gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century and is used by many scientists including adherents of the phylocode system gauthier defined aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds this was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils and assigning them instead to the avialae 9 in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs gauthier 10 identified four different definitions for the same biological name aves which is a problem gauthier proposed to reserve the term aves only for the crown group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants which corresponds to meaning number 4 below he assigned other names to the other groups crocodiles birds turtles lizards including snakes the birds phylogenetic relationships to major living reptile groups aves can mean all archosaurs closer to birds than to crocodiles alternately avemetatarsalia aves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers alternately avifilopluma aves can mean those feathered dinosaurs that fly alternately avialae aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants a crown group in this sense synonymous with neornithes under the fourth definition archaeopteryx is an avialan and not a member of aves gauthier s proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of palaeontology and bird evolution though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent avialae initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of aves is often used synonymously with the vernacular term bird by these researchers 11 most researchers define avialae as branch-based clade though definitions vary many authors have used a definition similar to all theropods closer to birds than to deinonychus 12 13 avialae is also occasionally defined as an apomorphy-based clade that is one based on physical characteristics jacques gauthier who named avialae in 1986 re-defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight and the birds that descended from them 10 14 dinosaurs and the origin of birds anchiornis huxleyi is an important source of information on the early evolution of birds in the late jurassic period 15 paraves scansoriopterygidae eosinopteryx eumaniraptora jinfengopteryx aurornis dromaeosauridae troodontidae avialae cladogram following the results of a phylogenetic study by cau et al 2015 16 based on fossil and biological evidence most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs 17 and more specifically they are members of maniraptora a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids among others 18 as scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred recent discoveries in the liaoning province of northeast china which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs contribute to this ambiguity 19 20 21 the consensus view in contemporary palaeontology is that the flying theropods or avialans are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids 22 together these form a group called paraves some basal members of this group such as microraptor have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly the most basal deinonychosaurs were very small this evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal have been able to glide or both 23 24 unlike archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs who primarily ate meat recent studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores 25 the late jurassic archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics teeth clawed fingers and a long lizard-like tail as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds it is not considered a direct ancestor of birds though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor 26 early evolution confuciusornis sanctus a cretaceous bird from china that lived 125 million years ago is the oldest known bird to have a beak 27 avialae anchiornis archaeopteryx xiaotingia rahonavis jeholornis jixiangornis euavialae balaur avebrevicauda zhongjianornis sapeornis pygostylia confuciusornithiformes protopteryx pengornis ornithothoraces cladogram following the results of a phylogenetic study by cau et al 2015 16 the earliest known avialan fossils come from the tiaojishan formation of china which has been dated to the late jurassic period oxfordian stage about 160 million years ago the avialan species from this time period include anchiornis huxleyi xiaotingia zhengi and aurornis xui 11 the well-known early avialan archaeopteryx dates from slightly later jurassic rocks about 155 million years old from germany many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds but were later lost during bird evolution these features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life and long feathers or hind wings covering the hind limbs and feet which may have been used in aerial maneuvering 28 avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the cretaceous period 29 many groups retained primitive characteristics such as clawed wings and teeth though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups including modern birds aves while the earliest forms such as archaeopteryx and jeholornis retained the long bony tails of their ancestors 29 the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the pygostyle bone in the group pygostylia in the late cretaceous around 95 million years ago the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell 30 early diversity of bird ancestors ichthyornis which lived 93 million years ago was the first known prehistoric bird relative preserved with teeth ornithothoraces enantiornithes euornithes archaeorhynchus ornithuromorpha patagopteryx vorona schizooura hongshanornithidae jianchangornis songlingornithidae gansus apsaravis ornithurae hesperornithes ichthyornis vegavis aves mesozoic bird phylogeny simplified after wang et al 2015 s phylogenetic analysis 31 the first large diverse lineage of short-tailed avialans to evolve were the enantiornithes or opposite birds so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters while they were the dominant group of avialans during the cretaceous period enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the mesozoic era 29 many species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify the euornithes meaning true birds because they include the ancestors of modern birds were semi-aquatic and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms unlike the enantiornithes which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species waders and swimming and diving species the later included the superficially gull-like ichthyornis 32 the hesperornithiformes which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic 29 the early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds like strongly keeled breastbones toothless beaked portions of their jaws though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws 33 euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers 34 which may have replaced the hind wing as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight 28 diversification of modern birds aves palaeognathae struthioniformes tinamiformes neognathae other birds neoaves galloanserae anseriformes galliformes basal divergences of modern birds based on sibley-ahlquist taxonomy all modern birds lie within the crown group aves alternately neornithes which has two subdivisions the palaeognathae which includes the flightless ratites such as the ostriches and the weak-flying tinamous and the extremely diverse neognathae containing all other birds 35 these two subdivisions are often given the rank of superorder 36 although livezey and zusi assigned them cohort rank 7 depending on the taxonomic viewpoint the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 37 to 10,050 38 the discovery of vegavis a late cretaceous member of the anatidae proved that the diversification of modern birds started before the cenozoic 39 the affinities of an earlier fossil the possible galliform austinornis lentus dated to about 85 million years ago 40 are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird diversification most studies agree on a cretaceous age for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds but estimates range from the middle cretaceous 1 to the latest late cretaceous 41 similarly there is no agreement on whether most of the early diversification of modern birds occurred before or after the cretaceous palaeogene extinction event 42 this disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence most molecular dating studies suggests a cretaceous radiation while fossil evidence points to a cenozoic radiation the so-called rocks versus clocks controversy previous attempts to reconcile molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial 42 43 but more recent estimates using a more comprehensive sample of fossils and a new way of calibrating molecular clocks showed that while modern birds originated early in the late cretaceous a pulse of diversification in all major groups occurred around the cretaceous palaeogene extinction event 44

psittacopasserae psittaciformes parrots passeriformes passerines the classification of birds is a contentious issue sibley and ahlquist s phylogeny and classification of birds 1990 is a landmark work on the classification of birds 47 although it is frequently debated and constantly revised most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate 48 but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves evidence from modern bird anatomy fossils and dna have all been brought to bear on the problem but no strong consensus has emerged more recently new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders 49 41 distribution the range of the house sparrow has expanded dramatically due to human activities 50 birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel s breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres 270 mi inland in antarctica 51 the highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions it was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics 52 several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world s oceans and in them with some seabird species coming ashore only to breed 53 and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres 980 ft deep 54 many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans some of these introductions have been deliberate the ring-necked pheasant for example has been introduced around the world as a game bird 55 others have been accidental such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several north american cities after their escape from captivity 56 some species including cattle egret 57 yellow-headed caracara 58 and galah 59 have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat anatomy and physiology external anatomy of a bird example

foot 17 tibia 18 belly 19 flanks 20 breast 21 throat 22 wattle 23 eyestripe compared with other vertebrates birds have a body plan that shows many unusual adaptations mostly to facilitate flight skeletal system the skeleton consists of very lightweight bones they have large air-filled cavities called pneumatic cavities which connect with the respiratory system 60 the skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures 61 the orbits are large and separated by a bony septum the spine has cervical thoracic lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical neck vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae 62 the last few are fused with the pelvis to form the synsacrum 61 the ribs are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders the forelimbs are modified into wings 63 excretory system like the reptiles birds are primarily uricotelic that is their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and with exception of the ostrich uric acid is excreted along with faeces as a semisolid waste 64 65 66 however birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia 67 they also excrete creatine rather than creatinine like mammals 61 this material as well as the output of the intestines emerges from the bird s cloaca 68 69 the cloaca is a multi-purpose opening waste is expelled through it most birds mate by joining cloaca and females lay eggs from it in addition many species of birds regurgitate pellets 70 males within palaeognathae with the exception of the kiwis the anseriformes with the exception of screamers and in rudimentary forms in galliformes but fully developed in cracidae possess a penis which is never present in neoaves 71 72 the length is thought to be related to sperm competition 73 when not copulating it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca just inside the vent the digestive system of birds is unique with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth 74 most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight 75 some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies including protein from the intestines as additional energy during migration 76 respiratory and circulatory systems birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups 61 upon inhalation 75 of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air the other 25 of the air goes directly into the lungs when the bird exhales the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs thus a bird s lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation 77 sound production is achieved using the syrinx a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea 78 the trachea being elongated in some species increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird s size 79 in birds the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right aortic arch or pharyngeal arch unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms this part of the aorta 61 the postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system unlike in mammals the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus 80 heart type and features didactic model of an avian heart the avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac this pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication 81 the heart itself is divided into a right and left half each with an atrium and ventricle the atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction being myogenic the heart s pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node located on the right atrium the sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarising signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles the avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers much like a mammalian heart the avian heart is composed of endocardial myocardial and epicardial layers 81 the atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass this adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight 82 organisation birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals as a result birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal 82 the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction and become more rigid as they move away from the heart blood moves through the arteries which undergo vasoconstriction and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body 83 as the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste in the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart veins unlike arteries are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure as blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart 83 once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body the nictitating membrane as it covers the eye of a masked lapwing nervous system the nervous system is large relative to the bird s size 61 the most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns navigation mating and nest building most birds have a poor sense of smell 84 with notable exceptions including kiwis 85 new world vultures 86 and tubenoses 87 the avian visual system is usually highly developed water birds have special flexible lenses allowing accommodation for vision in air and water 61 some species also have dual fovea birds are tetrachromatic possessing ultraviolet uv sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green red and blue ones 88 many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers 89 ultraviolet light is also used in foraging kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the uv reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents 90 with the exception of pigeons and a few other species 91 the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane a third eyelid that moves horizontally 92 the nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds 61 the bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten 61 most birds cannot move their eyes although there are exceptions such as the great cormorant 93 birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field while birds with eyes on the front of their heads such as owls have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field 94 the avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers although in some birds such as the asio bubo and otus owls these feathers form tufts which resemble ears the inner ear has a cochlea but it is not spiral as in mammals 95 defence and intraspecific combat a few species are able to use chemical defences against predators some procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant stomach oil against an aggressor 96 and some species of pitohuis from new guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in their skin and feathers 97 a lack of field observations limit our knowledge but intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death 98 the screamers anhimidae some jacanas jacana hydrophasianus the spur-winged goose plectropterus the torrent duck merganetta and nine species of lapwing vanellus use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon the steamer ducks tachyeres geese and swans anserinae the solitaire pezophaps sheathbills chionis some guans crax and stone curlews burhinus use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents 98 the jacanas actophilornis and irediparra have an expanded blade-like radius the extinct xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail swans for instance may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young 98 chromosomes birds have two sexes either female or male the sex of birds is determined by the z and w sex chromosomes rather than by the x and y chromosomes present in mammals male birds have two z chromosomes zz and female birds have a w chromosome and a z chromosome wz 61 in nearly all species of birds an individual s sex is determined at fertilisation however one recent study demonstrated temperature-dependent sex determination among the australian brushturkey for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male sex ratio 99 this however was later proven to not be the case these birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination but temperature-dependent sex mortality 100 feathers plumage and scales the disruptively patterned plumage of the african scops owl allows it to blend in with its surroundings feathers are a feature characteristic of birds though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds they facilitate flight provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation and are used in display camouflage and signalling 61 there are several types of feathers each serving its own set of purposes feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae the distribution pattern of these feather tracts pterylosis is used in taxonomy and systematics the arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body called plumage may vary within species by age social status 101 and sex 102 plumage is regularly moulted the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the non-breeding plumage or in the humphrey-parkes terminology basic plumage breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the humphrey-parkes system as alternate plumages 103 moulting is annual in most species although some may have two moults a year and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years moulting patterns vary across species in passerines flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first when the fifth of sixth primary is replaced the outermost tertiaries begin to drop after the innermost tertiaries are moulted the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers centrifugal moult the greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap 104 a small number of species such as ducks and geese lose all of their flight feathers at once temporarily becoming flightless 105 as a general rule the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair 104 centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the phasianidae 106 the centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail 104 107 the general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward secondaries inward and the tail from centre outward 108 before nesting the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly the skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation 109 red lory preening feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily spending an average of around 9 of their daily time on this 110 the bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland these secretions protect the feathers flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria 111 this may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting to remove feather parasites 112 the scales of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks claws and spurs they are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds most bird scales do not overlap significantly except in the cases of kingfishers and woodpeckers the scales of birds are thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals 113 flight restless flycatcher in the downstroke of flapping flight most birds can fly which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators birds have various adaptations for flight including a lightweight skeleton two large flight muscles the pectoralis which accounts for 15 of the total mass of the bird and the supracoracoideus as well as a modified forelimb wing that serves as an aerofoil 61 wing shape and size generally determine a bird s flight style and performance many birds combine powered flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight about 60 extant bird species are flightless as were many extinct birds 114 flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators 115 though flightless penguins use similar musculature and movements to fly through the water as do auks shearwaters and dippers 116 behaviour most birds are diurnal but some birds such as many species of owls and nightjars are nocturnal or crepuscular active during twilight hours and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate by day or night 117 diet and feeding feeding adaptations in beaks birds diets are varied and often include nectar fruit plants seeds carrion and various small animals including other birds 61 because birds have no teeth their digestive system is adapted to process unmasticated food items that are swallowed whole 118 birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists 61 birds feeding strategies vary by species many birds glean for insects invertebrates fruit or seeds some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial biological control agents and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes 119 nectar feeders such as hummingbirds sunbirds lories and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers 120 kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates shorebirds varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches 61 121 loons diving ducks penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater using their wings or feet for propulsion 53 while aerial predators such as sulids kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey flamingos three species of prion and some ducks are filter feeders 122 123 geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers some species including frigatebirds gulls 124 and skuas 125 engage in kleptoparasitism stealing food items from other birds kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting rather than a significant part of any species diet a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40 of their food and on average stole only 5 126 other birds are scavengers some of these like vultures are specialised carrion eaters while others like gulls corvids or other birds of prey are opportunists 127 water and drinking water is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of sweat glands reduces the physiological demands 128 some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food they may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting 129 seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils 130 most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat some species especially of arid zones belonging to the pigeon finch mousebird button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads 131 some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers 132 some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food the pigeon family flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks 133 feather care feathers being critical to the survival of a bird require maintenance apart from physical wear and tear feathers face the onslaught of fungi ectoparasitic feather mites and birdlice 134 the physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland birds also bathe in water or dust themselves while some birds dip into shallow water more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe a behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage 135 136 migration a flock of canada geese in v formation many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat these migrations vary among the different groups many landbirds shorebirds and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions these birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere before migration birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs 76 137 migration is highly demanding energetically particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling landbirds have a flight range of around 2,500 km 1,600 mi and shorebirds can fly up to 4,000 km 2,500 mi 138 although the bar-tailed godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200 km 6,300 mi 139 seabirds also undertake long migrations the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters which nest in new zealand and chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the north pacific off japan alaska and california an annual round trip of 64,000 km 39,800 mi 140 other seabirds disperse after breeding travelling widely but having no set migration route albatrosses nesting in the southern ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons 141 the routes of satellite-tagged bar-tailed godwits migrating north from new zealand this species has the longest known non-stop migration of any species up to 10,200 km 6,300 mi some bird species undertake shorter migrations travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next this type of migration is normally associated with food availability 142 species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics others undertake partial migrations where only a fraction of the population usually females and subdominant males migrates 143 partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions in australia surveys found that 44 of non-passerine birds and 32 of passerines were partially migratory 144 altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions it is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food 145 some species may also be nomadic holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive irruptive nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations 146 the ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a manx shearwater released in boston in the united states returned to its colony in skomer in wales within 13 days a distance of 5,150 km 3,200 mi 147 birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods for diurnal migrants the sun is used to navigate by day and a stellar compass is used at night birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock 61 orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding polaris 148 these are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the earth s geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors 149 communication bird song song of the house wren a common north american songbird problems playing this file see media help the startling display of the sunbittern mimics a large predator birds communicate using primarily visual and auditory signals signals can be interspecific between species and intraspecific within species birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance 150 to display breeding condition in sexually selected species or to make threatening displays as in the sunbittern s mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks 151 variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds particularly between species visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening the adjustments of feather position pecking or other behaviour these displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds 61 the most elaborate displays occur during courtship where dances are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements 152 males breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays 153 bird calls and songs which are produced in the syrinx are the major means by which birds communicate with sound this communication can be very complex some species can operate the two sides of the syrinx independently allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs 78 calls are used for a variety of purposes including mate attraction 61 evaluation of potential mates 154 bond formation the claiming and maintenance of territories 61 the identification of other individuals such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season 155 and the warning of other birds of potential predators sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat 156 some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication the coenocorypha snipes of new zealand drive air through their feathers 157 woodpeckers drum territorially 75 and palm cockatoos use tools to drum 158 flocking and other associations red-billed queleas the most numerous species of bird 159 form enormous flocks sometimes tens of thousands strong while some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups other birds may form large flocks the principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency 61 defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system this has led to the development of many mixed-species feeding flocks which are usually composed of small numbers of many species these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources 160 costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases 161 birds sometimes also form associations with non-avian species plunge-diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna which push shoaling fish towards the surface 162 hornbills have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses in which they forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators 163 resting and roosting many birds like this american flamingo tuck their head into their back when sleeping the high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening peeks allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats 164 swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight 165 it has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight 166 some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time the birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock this may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock this adaptation is also known from marine mammals 167 communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators 168 roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety 169 many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers although others place their beaks among their breast feathers many birds rest on one leg while some may pull up their legs into their feathers especially in cold weather perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep many ground birds such as quails and pheasants roost in trees a few parrots of the genus loriculus roost hanging upside down 170 some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates 171 this physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species including owlet-nightjars nightjars and woodswallows one species the common poorwill even enters a state of hibernation 172 birds do not have sweat glands but they may cool themselves by moving to shade standing in water panting increasing their surface area fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves breeding social systems like others of its family the male raggiana bird-of-paradise has elaborate breeding plumage used to impress females 173 ninety-five per cent of bird species are socially monogamous these species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or in some cases for several years or until the death of one mate 174 monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care which is especially important for species in which females require males assistance for successful brood-rearing 175 among many socially monogamous species extra-pair copulation infidelity is common 176 such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids 177 female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation a hundred days in some species 178 sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism for females possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate 179 males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise 180 other mating systems including polygyny polyandry polygamy polygynandry and promiscuity also occur 61 polygamous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males 61 some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances breeding usually involves some form of courtship display typically performed by the male 181 most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song some displays however are quite elaborate depending on the species these may include wing or tail drumming dancing aerial flights or communal lekking females are generally the ones that drive partner selection 182 although in the polyandrous phalaropes this is reversed plainer males choose brightly coloured females 183 courtship feeding billing and allopreening are commonly performed between partners generally after the birds have paired and mated 75 homosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds including copulation pair-bonding and joint parenting of chicks 184 territories nesting and incubation many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks species that are unable to defend feeding territories such as seabirds and swifts often breed in colonies instead this is thought to offer protection from predators colonial breeders defend small nesting sites and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense 185 all birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate 61 hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs there are many exceptions to this pattern however the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite s egg which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts 186 male golden-backed weavers construct elaborate suspended nests out of grass bird eggs are usually laid in a nest most species create somewhat elaborate nests which can be cups domes plates beds scrapes mounds or burrows 187 some bird nests however are extremely primitive albatross nests are no more than a scrape on the ground most birds build nests in sheltered hidden areas to avoid predation but large or colonial birds which are more capable of defence may build more open nests during nest construction some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival 188 and feathers are often used for nest insulation 187 some bird species have no nests the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet the absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial nest of an eastern phoebe that has been parasitised by a brown-headed cowbird incubation which optimises temperature for chick development usually begins after the last egg has been laid 61 in monogamous species incubation duties are often shared whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds incubation can be an energetically demanding process adult albatrosses for instance lose as much as 83 grams 2.9 oz of body weight per day of incubation 189 the warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun decaying vegetation or volcanic sources 190 incubation periods range from 10 days in woodpeckers cuckoos and passerine birds to over 80 days in albatrosses and kiwis 61 the diversity of characteristics of birds is great sometimes even in closely related species several avian characteristics are compared in the table below 191 192 species adult weight grams incubation days clutches per year clutch size ruby-throated hummingbird archilochus colubris 3 13 2.0 2 house sparrow

chicks range in development from helpless to independent depending on their species helpless chicks are termed altricial and tend to be born small blind immobile and naked chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed precocial altricial chicks need help thermoregulating and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks the young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the precocial or altricial category having some aspects of each and thus fall somewhere on an altricial-precocial spectrum 193 chicks at neither extreme but favoring one or the other may be termed semi-precocial 194 or semi-altricial 195 196 a female calliope hummingbird feeding fully grown chicks altricial chicks of a white-breasted woodswallow the length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species at one extreme parental care in megapodes ends at hatching the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately 197 at the other extreme many seabirds have extended periods of parental care the longest being that of the great frigatebird whose chicks take up to six months to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months 198 the chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched the main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation 199 in some species both parents care for nestlings and fledglings in others such care is the responsibility of only one sex in some species other members of the same species usually close relatives of the breeding pair such as offspring from previous broods will help with the raising of the young 200 such alloparenting is particularly common among the corvida which includes such birds as the true crows australian magpie and fairy-wrens 201 but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite among most groups of animals male parental care is rare in birds however it is quite common more so than in any other vertebrate class 61 though territory and nest site defence incubation and chick feeding are often shared tasks there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty 202 the point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically the chicks of the synthliboramphus murrelets like the ancient murrelet leave the nest the night after they hatch following their parents out to sea where they are raised away from terrestrial predators 203 some other species such as ducks move their chicks away from the nest at an early age in most species chicks leave the nest just before or soon after they are able to fly the amount of parental care after fledging varies albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging 204 chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration 205 brood parasites reed warbler raising a common cuckoo a brood parasite brood parasitism in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual s brood is more common among birds than any other type of organism 206 after a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird s nest they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host s own brood brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young or non-obligate brood parasites which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young 207 one hundred bird species including honeyguides icterids and ducks are obligate parasites though the most famous are the cuckoos 206 some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host s young which allows them to destroy the host s eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host s chicks this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks 208 sexual selection the peacock tail in flight the classic example of a fisherian runaway birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviours with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the fisherian runaway commonly occurring sexual dimorphisms such as size and colour differences are energetically costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations 209 many types of avian sexual selection have been identified intersexual selection also known as female choice and intrasexual competition where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual s fitness conflicts between an individual fitness and signalling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and courtship behaviour are honest traits signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviours 210 inbreeding depression inbreeding causes early death inbreeding depression in the zebra finch taeniopygia guttata 211 embryo survival that is hatching success of fertile eggs was significantly lower for sib-sib mating pairs than for unrelated pairs darwin s finch geospiza scandens experiences inbreeding depression reduced survival of offspring and the magnitude of this effect is influenced by environmental conditions such as low food availability 212 inbreeding avoidance incestuous matings by the purple-crowned fairy wren malurus coronatus result in severe fitness costs due to inbreeding depression greater than 30 reduction in hatchability of eggs 213 females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings see promiscuity other animals for 90 frequency in avian species that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding however there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings nevertheless 43 of broods produced by incestuously paired females contained extra pair young 213 inbreeding depression occurs in the great tit parus major when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness in natural populations of parus major inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative 214 southern pied babblers turdoides bicolor appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways the first is through dispersal and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates 215 although both males and females disperse locally they move outside the range where genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered within their group individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite-sex breeder is unrelated cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring usually males delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin 216 female offspring rarely stay at home dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently or to join unrelated groups in general inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness inbreeding depression due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles 217 cross-fertilisation between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny 218 219 ecology gran canaria blue chaffinch an example of a bird highly specialised in its habitat in this case in the canarian pine forests birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions 159 while some birds are generalists others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements even within a single habitat such as a forest the niches occupied by different species of birds vary with some species feeding in the forest canopy others beneath the canopy and still others on the forest floor forest birds may be insectivores frugivores and nectarivores aquatic birds generally feed by fishing plant eating and piracy or kleptoparasitism birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds while vultures are specialised scavengers avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal 220 plants and pollinating birds often coevolve 221 and in some cases a flower s primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar 222 birds are often important to island ecology birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not on those islands birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals for example in new zealand the moas were important browsers as are the kereru and kokako today 220 today the plants of new zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa 223 nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano which may enrich the local soil 224 and the surrounding seas 225 a wide variety of avian ecology field methods including counts nest monitoring and capturing and marking are used for researching avian ecology relationship with humans industrial farming of chickens since birds are highly visible and common animals humans have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man 226 sometimes these relationships are mutualistic like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and african peoples such as the borana 227 other times they may be commensal as when species such as the house sparrow 228 have benefited from human activities several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests 229 and some pose an aviation hazard 230 human activities can also be detrimental and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction hunting avian lead poisoning pesticides roadkill wind turbine kills 231 and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psittacosis salmonellosis campylobacteriosis mycobacteriosis avian tuberculosis avian influenza bird flu giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis over long distances some of these are zoonotic diseases that can also be transmitted to humans 232 economic importance the use of cormorants by asian fishermen is in steep decline but survives in some areas as a tourist attraction domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs called poultry are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans in 2003 76 million tons of poultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide 233 chickens account for much of human poultry consumption though domesticated turkeys ducks and geese are also relatively common many species of birds are also hunted for meat bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas the most important birds hunted in north and south america are waterfowl other widely hunted birds include pheasants wild turkeys quail doves partridge grouse snipe and woodcock 234 muttonbirding is also popular in australia and new zealand 235 though some hunting such as that of muttonbirds may be sustainable hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species 236 other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers especially the down of geese and ducks which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding and seabird faeces guano which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen the war of the pacific sometimes called the guano war was fought in part over the control of guano deposits 237 birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes colourful birds such as parrots and mynas are bred in captivity or kept as pets a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species 238 falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing respectively messenger pigeons used since at least 1 ad remained important as recently as world war ii today such activities are more common either as hobbies for entertainment and tourism 239 or for sports such as pigeon racing amateur bird enthusiasts called birdwatchers twitchers or more commonly birders number in the millions 240 many homeowners erect bird feeders near their homes to attract various species bird feeding has grown into a multimillion-dollar industry for example an estimated 75 of households in britain provide food for birds at some point during the winter 241 in religion and mythology the 3 of birds by the master of the playing cards 15th-century germany birds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology in religion birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity such as in the cult of makemake in which the tangata manu of easter island served as chiefs 242 or as attendants as in the case of hugin and munin the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the norse god odin 243 in several civilisations of ancient italy particularly etruscan and roman religion priests were involved in augury or interpreting the words of birds while the auspex from which the word auspicious is derived watched their activities to foretell events 244 they may also serve as religious symbols as when jonah hebrew dove embodied the fright passivity mourning and beauty traditionally associated with doves 245 birds have themselves been deified as in the case of the common peacock which is perceived as mother earth by the dravidians of india 246 in religious images preserved from the inca and tiwanaku empires birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms 247 indigenous peoples of the central andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds 247 in culture and folklore painted tiles with design of birds from qajar dynasty birds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times when they were represented in early cave paintings 248 some birds have been perceived as monsters including the mythological roc and the m ori s legendary pou kai a giant bird capable of snatching humans 249 birds were later used as symbols of power as in the magnificent peacock throne of the mughal and persian emperors 250 with the advent of scientific interest in birds many paintings of birds were commissioned for books among the most famous of these bird artists was john james audubon whose paintings of north american birds were a great commercial success in europe and who later lent his name to the national audubon society 251 birds are also important figures in poetry for example homer incorporated nightingales into his odyssey and catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his catullus 2 252 the relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of samuel taylor coleridge s the rime of the ancient mariner which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a burden 253 other english metaphors derive from birds vulture funds and vulture investors for instance take their name from the scavenging vulture 254 perceptions of bird species vary across cultures owls are associated with bad luck witchcraft and death in parts of africa 255 but are regarded as wise across much of europe 256 hoopoes were considered sacred in ancient egypt and symbols of virtue in persia but were thought of as thieves across much of europe and harbingers of war in scandinavia 257 in heraldry birds especially eagles often appear in coats of arms 258 in music in music birdsong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways they can be inspired by birdsong they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition as vivaldi messiaen and beethoven did along with many later composers they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works as ottorino respighi first did or like beatrice harrison and david rothenberg they can duet with birds 259 260 261 262 conservation the california condor once numbered only 22 birds but conservation measures have raised that to over 300 today though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species such as the barn swallow and european starling they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times 263 although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions eradicating an estimated 750 1800 species occurred during the human colonisation of melanesian polynesian and micronesian islands 264 many bird populations are declining worldwide with 1,227 species listed as threatened by birdlife international and the iucn in 2009 265 266 the most commonly cited human threat to birds is habitat loss 267 other threats include overhunting accidental mortality due to collisions with buildings or vehicles long-line fishing bycatch 268 pollution including oil spills and pesticide use 269 competition and predation from nonnative invasive species 270 and climate change governments and conservation groups work to protect birds either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions such projects have produced some successes one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004 including the california condor and norfolk parakeet 271 see also animal track bat glossary of bird terms ornithology notes a b c d lee michael sy cau andrea darren naish
