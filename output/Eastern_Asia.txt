and geopolitically it includes mainland china hong kong macau japan mongolia north korea south korea and taiwan 3 4 5 6 7 1 8 9 10 11 12 the region was the cradle of various ancient civilizations such as ancient china ancient japan ancient korea and the mongol empire 13 14 east asia was one of the cradles of world civilization with china an ancient east asian civilization being one of the earliest cradles of civilization in human history for thousands of years china largely influenced east asia as it was principally the leading civilization in the region exerting its enormous prestige and influence on its neighbors 15 16 17 historically societies in east asia have been part of the chinese cultural sphere and east asian vocabulary and scripts are often derived from classical chinese and chinese script the chinese calendar preserves traditional east asian culture and serves as the root to which many other east asian calendars are derived from major religions in east asia include buddhism mostly mahayana 18 confucianism and neo-confucianism taoism ancestral worship and chinese folk religion in mainland china hong kong macau and taiwan shintoism in japan and sindoism in korea 19 shamanism is also prevalent among mongols and other indigenous populations of northern east asia such as the manchus 20 21 east asians comprise around 1.6 billion people about 38 of the population of asia and 22 of the world s population lives in east asia the region is to home to major world metropolises such as beijing hong kong seoul shanghai taipei and tokyo although the coastal and

links history edit in comparison with the profound influence of the ancient greeks and romans on europe and the western world china would already possess an advanced civilization nearly half a millennia before japan and korea 22 as chinese civilization existed for about 1500 years before other east asian civilizations emerged into history imperial china would exert much of its cultural economic technological and political muscle onto its neighbors 23 24 25 succeeding chinese dynasties exerted enormous influence across east asia culturally economically politically and militarily for over two millennia 25 imperial china s cultural preeminence not only led the country to become east asia s first literate nation in the entire region it also supplied japan and korea with chinese loanwords and linguistic influences rooted in their writing systems 26 in addition the chinese han dynasty hosted the largest unified population in east asia the most literate and urbanized as well as being the most technologically and culturally advanced civilization in the region 27 cultural and religious interaction between the chinese and other regional east asian dynasties and kingdoms occurred china s impact and influence on korea began with the han dynasty s northeastern expansion in 108 bc when the han chinese conquered the northern part of the korean peninsula and established a province called lelang chinese influence would soon take root in korea through the inclusion of the chinese writing system monetary system rice culture and confucian political institutions 28 jomon society in ancient japan incorporated wet-rice cultivation and metallurgy through its contact with korea as full fledged medieval east asian states were established korea by the fourth century ad and japan by the seventh century ad korea and japan actively began to incorporate chinese influences such as confucianism the use of written han characters chinese style architecture state institutions political philosophies religion urban planning and various scientific and technological methods into their culture and society through direct contacts with succeeding chinese dynasties 29 for many centuries most notably from the 7th to the 14th centuries china stood as east asia s most advanced civilization commanding influence across the region up until the early modern period 30 the imperial chinese tributary system shaped much of east asia s history for over two millennia due to imperial china s economic and cultural influence over the region and thus played a huge role in the history of east asia in particular 31 32 24 the transmission of advanced chinese cultural practices and ways of thinking greatly shaped the region up until the 19th century 22 as east asia s connections with europe and the western world strengthened during the late 19th century china s power began to decline u s commodore matthew c perry would open japan to western ways and the country would expand in earnest after the 1860s 33 around the same time japan with its rush to modernity transformed itself from an isolated feudal samurai state into east asia s first industrialized nation 34 9 the modern and powerful japan would galvanize its position in the orient as east asia s greatest power with a global mission poised to advance to lead the entire world 34 by the early 1900s the japanese empire succeeded in asserting itself as east asia s first modern power with its newly found international status japan would begin to inextricably take a more active position in east asia and leading role in world affairs at large flexing its nascent political and military might japan soundly defeated the stagnant qing dynasty during the first sino-japanese war as well as vanquishing imperial rival russia in 1905 the first major military victory in the modern era of an east asian power over a european one 35 33 its hegemony was the heart of an empire that would include taiwan and korea 34 during world war ii japanese expansionism with its imperialist aspirations through the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere would incorporate korea taiwan much of eastern china and manchuria hong kong and southeast asia under its control 36 after a century of exploitation by the european and japanese colonialists post-colonial east asia saw the defeat and occupation of japan by the victorious allies as well as the division of china and korea during the cold war the korean peninsula became independent but then it was divided into two rival states while taiwan became the main territory of de facto state republic of china after the latter lost mainland china to the people s republic of china in the chinese civil war during the latter half of the twentieth century the region would see the post war economic miracle of japan the economic rise of south korea and taiwan and the integration of mainland china into the global economy through its entry in the world trade organization while enhancing its emerging international status as a potential world power 4 37 united nations statistics division edit in common usage the term east asia typically refers to a region including china japan mongolia north korea south korea and taiwan 38 39 40 mainland china japan north korea south korea and taiwan constitute east asia 41 some scholars include vietnam as part of east asia as it has been considered part of the greater sphere of chinese influence though confucianism continues to play an important role in vietnamese culture chinese characters are no longer used in its written language and many scholarly organizations classify vietnam as a southeast asian country 42 43 mongolia is geographically north of mainland china yet confucianism and the chinese writing system and culture had no impact in mongolian society thus mongolia is sometimes grouped with central asian countries such as turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan 44 45 broader definitions such as that used by the world bank refer to the three major northeast asian economies i e china japan and south korea as well as mongolia north korea the russian far east and siberia 46 the council on foreign relations includes the russia far east mongolia and nepal 47 the world bank also acknowledges the roles of sub-national or de facto states such as hong kong macau and taiwan the economic research institute for northeast asia defines the region as china japan the koreas nepal mongolia and eastern regions of the russian federation 48 the countries of east asia also form the core of northeast asia which itself is a broader region east asia map of k ppen climate classification unsd geoscheme for asia based on statistic convenience rather than implying any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories 49 north asia central asia western asia south asia east asia southeast asia the unsd definition of east asia is based on statistical convenience 49 but also other common definitions of east asia contain the entirety of china including mainland hong kong macau mongolia north korea south korea japan and taiwan 1 50 culturally china japan korea taiwan and vietnam are commonly seen as being encompassed by cultural east asia east asian cultural sphere 2 51 52 53 alternative definitions edit there are mixed debates around the world whether these countries or regions should be considered in east asia or not vietnam officially part of southeast asia geographically although culturally it is a part of the east asian cultural sphere politically it is related to both southeast asia and east asia far eastern federal district in russia often described as north asia due to its location although this part of russia is often seen as more closely related to its east asian neighbours sovereignty issues exist over some territories in the south china sea in business and economics east asia is sometimes used to refer to a wide geographical area covering ten southeast asian countries in asean people s republic of china taiwan japan and south korea however in this context the term far east is used by the europeans to cover asean countries and the countries in east asia however being a eurocentric term far east describes the region s geographical position in relation to europe rather than its location within asia alternatively the term asia pacific region is often used in describing east asia southeast asia as well as oceania observers preferring a broader definition of east asia often use the term northeast asia to refer to the greater china area taiwan the korean peninsula and japan with southeast asia covering the ten asean countries this usage which is seen in economic and diplomatic discussions is at odds with the historical meanings of both east asia and northeast asia 54 55 56 the council on foreign relations defines northeast asia as japan and korea 47 economy edit state territory gdp nominal billions of usd 2017 57 gdp nominal per capita

civilization that had the most dominant influence in the region throughout the ages that ultimately laid the foundation for east asian civilization 73 the vast knowledge and ingenuity of chinese civilization and the classics of chinese literature and culture were seen as the foundations for a civilized life in east asia china served as a vehicle through which the adoption of confucian ethical philosophy chinese calendar system political and legal systems architectural style diet terminology institutions religious beliefs imperial examinations that emphasized a knowledge of chinese classics political philosophy and cultural value systems as well as historically sharing a common writing system reflected in the histories of japan and korea 74 25 75 76 77 78 79 the imperial chinese tributary system was the bedrock of network of trade and foreign relations between china and its east asian tributaries which helped to shape much of east asian affairs during the ancient and medieval eras through the tributary system the various dynasties of imperial china facilitated frequent economic and cultural exchange that influenced the cultures of japan and korea and drew them into a chinese international order 80 81 the imperial chinese tributary system shaped much of east asia s foreign policy and trade for over two millennia due to imperial china s economic and cultural dominance over the region and thus played a huge role in the history of east asia in particular 32 81 the relationship between china and its cultural influence on east asia has been compared to the
