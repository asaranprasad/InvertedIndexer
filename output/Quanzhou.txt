the centuries zhangzhou itself is named for its former status as the seat of the imperial chinese zhang river prefecture satin actually derives via french from the italian adjective setino silken derived from latin s t silk 24 among other testaments to this age are tombstones which have been found written in chinese arabic syriac and latin 17 it was considered so important by the jesuits that
