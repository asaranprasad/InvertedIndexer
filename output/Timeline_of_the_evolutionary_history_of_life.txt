of the evolutionary history of life represents the current scientific theory outlining the major events during the development of life on planet earth in biology evolution is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of biological organization from kingdoms to species and individual organisms and molecules such as dna and proteins the similarities between all present day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species living and extinct have diverged through the process of evolution more than 99 percent of all species amounting to over five billion species 1 that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct 2 3 estimates on the number of earth s current species range from 10 million to 14 million 4 of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described 5 while the dates given in this article are estimates based on scientific evidence there has been controversy between more traditional views of increased biodiversity through a cone of diversity with the passing of time and the view that the basic pattern on earth has been one of annihilation and diversification and that in certain past times such as the cambrian explosion there was great diversity 6 7 contents 1

also 4 references 5 bibliography 6 further reading 7 external links extinction edit visual representation of the history of life on earth as a spiral species go extinct constantly as environments change organisms compete for environmental niches and genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones occasionally biodiversity on the planet takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual 8 a large extinction event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction events that take place in a relatively brief period of time 9 the first known mass extinction in earth s history was the great oxygenation event 2.4 billion years ago the event led to the loss of most of the planet s obligate anaerobes the five largest extinction events in earth s history since are these 10 end of the ordovician 440 million years ago 86 of all species lost including graptolites late devonian 375 million years ago 75 of species lost including most trilobites end of the permian the great dying 251 million years ago 96 of species lost including tabulate corals and most extant trees and synapsids end of the triassic 200 million years ago 80 of species lost including all of the conodonts end of the cretaceous 66 million years ago 76 of species lost including all of the ammonites mosasaurs ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs pterosaurs and nonavian dinosaurs dates and percentages represent estimates smaller extinction events have occurred in the periods between these larger catastrophes with some standing at the delineation points of the periods and epochs recognized by scientists in geologic time the holocene extinction event is currently under way 11 factors in mass extinctions include continental drift changes in atmospheric and marine chemistry volcanism and other aspects of mountain formation changes in glaciation changes in sea level and impact events 9 detailed timeline edit in this timeline ma for megaannum means

around the young earth which eventually coalesced to form the moon 13 the gravitational pull of the new moon stabilised the earth s fluctuating axis of rotation and set up the conditions in which
