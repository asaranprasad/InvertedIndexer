presence of the thracians greeks persians celts romans goths alans and huns the emergence of a unified bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the first bulgarian empire in 681 ad which dominated most of the balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for slavs during the middle ages with the downfall of the second bulgarian empire in 1396 its territories came under ottoman rule for nearly five centuries the russo-turkish war of 1877 78 led to the formation of the third bulgarian state the following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours which prompted bulgaria to align with germany in both world wars in 1946 it became a one-party socialist state as part of the soviet-led eastern bloc in december 1989 the ruling communist party allowed multi-party elections which subsequently led to bulgaria s transition into a democracy and a market-based economy bulgaria s population of 7.2 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its 28 provinces most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city sofia the strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry power

bulgaria is taken from the word bulgars an extinct tribe of turkic origin which created the country within bulgaria some historians question the identification of the bulgars as a turkic tribe in favor of their north iranian origin 9 10 their name is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century ad 11 but it is possibly derived from the proto-turkic word bul ha to mix shake stir and its derivative bulgak revolt disorder 12 alternate etymologies include derivation from a mongolic cognate bul arak to separate split off citation needed or from a compound of proto-turkic bel five and gur arrow in the sense of tribe a proposed division within the utigurs or onogurs ten tribes 13 history part of a series on the history of bulgaria odrysian kingdom 460 bc

the lands of modern bulgaria can be traced back to the paleolithic organised prehistoric societies in bulgarian lands include the neolithic hamangia culture 14 vin a culture 15 and the eneolithic varna culture fifth millennium bc the latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation 16 17 some of these first gold smelters produced the coins weapons and jewellery of the varna necropolis treasure containing the oldest golden jewellery in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years 18 this site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest european societies 19 20 thracians one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern bulgarians 21 began appearing in the region during the iron age 22 in the late 6th century bc the persians conquered most of present-day bulgaria 23 24 25 and kept it until 479 bc 25 with influence from the persians 26 the bulk of the thracian tribes were united in the odrysian kingdom in the 470s bc by king teres 27 28 29 but were later subjugated by alexander the great and by the romans in 46 ad after the division of the roman empire in the 5th century the area fell under byzantine control by this time christianity had already spread in the region a small gothic community in nicopolis ad istrum produced the first germanic language book in the 4th century the wulfila bible 30 31 the first christian monastery in europe was established around the same time by saint athanasius in central bulgaria 32 from the 6th century the easternmost south slavs gradually settled in the region assimilating the partly hellenised or romanised thracians 33 34 35 first bulgarian empire khan krum feasts with his nobles after the battle of pliska his servant far right brings the wine-filled skull cup of nicephorus i in 680 the turkic semi-nomadic bulgar tribes 21 under the leadership of asparukh moved south across the danube and settled in the area between the lower danube and the balkan establishing their capital at pliska 36 37 a peace treaty with byzantium in 681 marked the beginning of the first bulgarian empire the bulgars gradually mixed with the local population adopting a common language on the basis of the local slavic dialect 38 succeeding rulers strengthened the bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries krum doubled the country s territory killed byzantine emperor nicephorus i in the battle of pliska 39 and introduced the first written code of law paganism was abolished in favour of eastern orthodox christianity under boris i in 864 this conversion was followed by a byzantine recognition of the bulgarian church 40 and the adoption of the cyrillic alphabet developed at preslav 41 which strengthened central authority and helped fuse the slavs and bulgars into a unified people 42 43 a subsequent cultural golden age began during the 34-year rule of simeon the great who also achieved the largest territorial expansion of the state 44 wars with magyars and pechenegs and the spread of the bogomil heresy weakened bulgaria after simeon s death 45 46 consecutive rus and byzantine invasions resulted in the seizure of the capital preslav by the byzantine army in 971 47 under samuil bulgaria briefly recovered from these attacks 48 but this rise ended when byzantine emperor basil ii defeated the bulgarian army at klyuch in 1014 samuil died shortly after the battle 49 and by 1018 the byzantines had ended the first bulgarian empire 50 second bulgarian empire after his conquest of bulgaria basil ii prevented revolts and discontent by retaining the rule of the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold allowing them to be paid in kind instead 51 he also allowed the bulgarian patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status and all its dioceses but reduced it to an archbishopric 51 52 after his death byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out the largest being led by peter delyan in 1185 asen dynasty nobles ivan asen i and peter iv organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the bulgarian state ivan asen and peter laid the foundations of the second bulgarian empire with tarnovo as the capital 53 the walls of tsarevets fortress in veliko tarnovo the capital of the second empire kaloyan the third of the asen monarchs extended his dominion to belgrade and ohrid he acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the pope and received a royal crown from a papal legate 54 the empire reached its zenith under ivan asen ii 1218 1241 when commerce and culture flourished 54 the strong economic and religious influence of tarnovo made it a third rome unlike the already declining constantinople 55 the country s military and economic might declined after the asen dynasty ended in 1257 facing internal conflicts constant byzantine and hungarian attacks and mongol domination 54 56 by the end of the 14th century factional divisions between the feudal landlords and the spread of bogomilism had caused the second bulgarian empire to split into three tsardoms vidin tarnovo and karvuna and several semi-independent principalities that fought each other along with byzantines hungarians serbs venetians and genoese by the late 14th century the ottoman turks had started their conquest of bulgaria and had taken most towns and fortresses south of the balkan mountains 54 ottoman rule hristo botev a prominent revolutionary in the april uprising tarnovo was captured by the ottomans after a three-month siege in 1393 after the battle of nicopolis in 1396 brought about the fall of the vidin tsardom the ottomans conquered all bulgarian lands south of the danube the nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to ottoman masters 57 with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries 58 under the ottoman system christians were considered an inferior class of people thus bulgarians like other christians were subjected to heavy taxes and a small portion of the bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete islamisation 59 and their culture was suppressed 58 ottoman authorities established the rum millet a religious administrative community which governed all orthodox christians regardless of their ethnicity 60 most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness identifying as christians 61 62 however the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive and that helped it to survive as in some rural remote areas 63 as well as in the militant catholic community in the northwestern part of the country 64 several bulgarian revolts erupted throughout the nearly five centuries of ottoman rule most notably the habsburg-backed 65 tarnovo uprisings in 1598 and in 1686 the chiprovtsi uprising in 1688 and karposh s rebellion in 1689 57 in the 18th century the enlightenment in western europe provided influence for the initiation of a movement known as the national awakening of bulgaria 57 it restored national consciousness and became a key factor in the liberation struggle resulting in the 1876 april uprising up to 30,000 bulgarians were killed as ottoman authorities put down the rebellion the massacres prompted the great powers to take action 66 they convened the constantinople conference in 1876 but their decisions were rejected by the ottomans this allowed the russian empire to seek a solution by force without risking military confrontation with other great powers as had happened in the crimean war 66 in 1877 russia declared war on the ottoman empire and defeated its forces with the help of bulgarian volunteers third bulgarian state the russian and bulgarian defence of shipka pass was crucial for the independence of bulgaria 67 the treaty of san stefano was signed on 3 march 1878 by russia and the ottoman empire and included a provision to set up an autonomous bulgarian principality roughly on the territories of the second bulgarian empire 68 69 3 march has since become liberation day a public holiday in bulgaria 70 though the holiday was suppressed and fell out of favour following the left-wing uprising in 1944 71 the other great powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the balkans might threaten their interests it was superseded by the subsequent treaty of berlin signed on 13 july which provided for a much smaller state comprising moesia and the region of sofia leaving large populations of bulgarians outside the new country 68 72 this played a significant role in forming bulgaria s militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century 73 the bulgarian principality won a war against serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous ottoman territory of eastern rumelia in 1885 proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 october 1908 74 in the years following independence bulgaria increasingly militarised and was often referred to as the balkan prussia 75 76 between 1912 and 1918 bulgaria became involved in three consecutive conflicts two balkan wars and world war i after a disastrous defeat in the second balkan war bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the central powers in world war i despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army 77 78 and achieving several decisive victories at doiran and dobrich the country capitulated in 1918 the war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed 79 more than 253,000 refugees immigrated to bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars 80 placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy 81 the political unrest resulting from these losses led to the establishment of a royal authoritarian dictatorship by tsar boris iii 1918 1943 bulgaria entered world war ii in 1941 as a member of the axis but declined to participate in operation barbarossa and saved its jewish population from deportation to concentration camps 82 the sudden death of boris iii in the summer of 1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against germany and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum the government of bogdan filov subsequently failed to achieve peace with the allies bulgaria did not comply with soviet demands to expel german forces from its territory resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the ussr in september 1944 83 the communist-dominated fatherland front took power ended participation in the axis and joined the allied side until the war ended 84 bulgarian soldiers with wire cutters during wwi the left-wing uprising of 9 september 1944 led to the abolition of monarchic rule but it was not until 1946 that a one-party people s republic was established 85 it became a part of the soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of georgi dimitrov 1946 1949 who laid the foundations for a rapidly industrialising stalinist state which was also highly repressive with thousands of dissidents executed 86 87 88 by the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly 89 while political repressions were lessened 90 by the 1980s both national and per capita gdps quadrupled 91 but the economy remained prone to debt spikes the most severe taking place in 1960 1977 and 1980 92 the soviet-style planned economy saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under todor zhivkov 1954 1989 93 his daughter lyudmila bolstered national pride by promoting bulgarian heritage culture and arts worldwide 94 in an attempt to erase the identity of the ethnic turk minority an assimilation campaign was launched in 1984 which included closing mosques and forcing ethnic turks to adopt slavic names these policies combined with the end of communist rule in 1989 resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic turks to turkey 95 96 under the influence of the collapsing of the eastern bloc on 10 november 1989 the communist party gave up its political monopoly zhivkov resigned and bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy 97 the first free elections in june 1990 were won by the bulgarian socialist party bsp the freshly renamed communist party 98 a new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in july 1991 the new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s 99 a 1997 reform package restored economic growth but living standards continued to suffer 100 after 2001 economic political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly 101 and bulgaria achieved high human development status 102 it became a member of nato in 2004 103 and participated in the war in afghanistan after several years of reforms it joined the european union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption 104 geography belogradchik rocks
