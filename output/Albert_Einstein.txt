theory of relativity one of the two pillars of modern physics alongside quantum mechanics 4 6 274 his work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science 7 8 he is best known by the general public for his mass energy equivalence formula e mc2 which has been dubbed the world s most famous equation 9 he received the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect 10 a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory near the beginning of his career einstein thought that newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field this led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the swiss patent office in bern 1902 1909 switzerland however he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916 he published a paper on general relativity he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules he also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light in 1917 he applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe 11 12 between 1895 and 1914 he lived in switzerland except for one year in prague 1911 12 where he received his academic diploma from the swiss federal polytechnic in z rich later the eidgen ssische technische hochschule eth in 1900 he later taught at that institute as a professor of theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 before he left for berlin in 1901 after being stateless for more than five years he acquired swiss citizenship which he kept for the rest of his life in 1905 he was awarded a phd by the university of z rich the same year his annus mirabilis miracle year he published four groundbreaking papers which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26 he was visiting the united states when adolf hitler came to power in 1933 and being jewish did not go back to germany where he had been a professor at the berlin academy of sciences he settled in the united states becoming an american citizen in 1940 13 on the eve of world war ii he endorsed a letter to president franklin d roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of extremely powerful bombs of a new type and recommending that the u s begin similar research this eventually led to what would become the manhattan project einstein supported defending the allied forces but generally denounced the idea of using the newly discovered nuclear fission as a weapon later with the british philosopher bertrand russell he signed the russell einstein manifesto which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons he was affiliated with the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey until his death in 1955 einstein published more than 300 scientific papers along with over 150 non-scientific works 11 14 his intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius 15 eugene wigner wrote of einstein in comparison to his contemporaries that einstein s understanding was deeper even than jansci von neumann s his mind was both more penetrating and more original than von neumann s and that is a very remarkable statement 16 contents 1 life and career 1.1 early life and education 1.2 marriages and children 1.3

physics 6 chemistry 5 natural history 5 art and technical drawing 4 albert einstein was born in ulm in the kingdom of w rttemberg in the german empire on 14 march 1879 5 his parents were hermann einstein a salesman and engineer and pauline koch in 1880 the family moved to munich where einstein s father and his uncle jakob founded elektrotechnische fabrik j einstein cie a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current 5 the einsteins were non-observant ashkenazi jews and albert attended a catholic elementary school in munich from the age of 5 for three years at the age of 8 he was transferred to the luitpold gymnasium now known as the albert einstein gymnasium where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the german empire seven years later 17 in 1894 hermann and jakob s company lost a bid to supply the city of munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current dc standard to the more efficient alternating current ac standard 18 the loss forced the sale of the munich factory in search of business the einstein family moved to italy first to milan and a few months later to pavia when the family moved to pavia einstein then 15 stayed in munich to finish his studies at the luitpold gymnasium his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering but einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school s regimen and teaching method he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning at the end of december 1894 he travelled to italy to join his family in pavia convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor s note 19 during his time in italy he wrote a short essay with the title on the investigation of the state of the ether in a magnetic field 20 21 contrary to popular mythology einstein always excelled at maths and physics from a young age reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers the twelve year old einstein taught himself algebra and euclidean geometry over a single summer einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the pythagorean theorem at age 12 22 a family tutor max talmud says that after he had given the 12 year old einstein a geometry textbook after a short time einstein had worked through the whole book he thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high i could not follow 23 his passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve year old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a mathematical structure 23 einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12 and as a 14 year old he says he had mastered integral and differential calculus 24 at age 13 einstein was introduced to kant s critique of pure reason and kant became his favourite philosopher his tutor stating at the time he was still a child only thirteen years old yet kant s works incomprehensible to ordinary mortals seemed to be clear to him 23 in 1895 at the age of 16 einstein took the entrance examinations for the swiss federal polytechnic in z rich later the eidgen ssische technische hochschule eth he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination 25 but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics 26 on the advice of the principal of the polytechnic he attended the argovian cantonal school gymnasium in aarau switzerland in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling while lodging with the family of professor jost winteler he fell in love with winteler s daughter marie albert s sister maja later married winteler s son paul 27 in january 1896 with his father s approval einstein renounced his citizenship in the german kingdom of w rttemberg to avoid military service 28 in september 1896 he passed the swiss matura with mostly good grades including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects on a scale of 1 6 29 at 17 he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the z rich polytechnic marie winteler who was a year older moved to olsberg switzerland for a teaching post einstein s future wife a 20-year old serbian woman mileva mari also enrolled at the polytechnic that year she was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course over the next few years einstein and mari s friendship developed into romance and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which einstein was taking an increasing interest in 1900 einstein passed the exams in maths and physics and was awarded the federal polytechnic teaching diploma 30 there have been claims that mari collaborated with einstein on his 1905 papers 31 32 known as the annus mirabilis papers but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions 33 34 35 36 marriages and children albert einstein in 1904 age 25 the discovery and publication in 1987 of an early correspondence between einstein and mari revealed that they had had a daughter called lieserl in their letters born in early 1902 in novi sad where mari was staying with her parents mari returned to switzerland without the child whose real name and fate are unknown einstein probably never saw his daughter the contents of his letter to mari in september 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy 37 38 einstein with his second-wife elsa 1921 einstein and mari married in january 1903 in may 1904 their first son hans albert einstein was born in bern switzerland their second son eduard was born in z rich in july 1910 in april 1914 they moved to berlin after a few months his wife returned to z rich with their sons after learning that einstein s chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin elsa 39 they divorced on 14 february 1919 having lived apart for five years 40 eduard whom his father called tete for petit had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia 41 his mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods finally being committed permanently after her death 42 in letters revealed in 2015 einstein wrote to his early love marie winteler about his marriage and his still-strong feelings for her in 1910 while his wife was pregnant with their second child einstein wrote to marie that i think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be einstein spoke about a misguided love and a missed life regarding his love for marie 43 einstein married elsa l wenthal in 1919 44 45 after having had a personal relationship with her since 1912 46 she was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally 46 in 1933 they emigrated to the united states in 1935 elsa einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems she died in december 1936 47 friends among einstein s well-known friends were michele besso paul ehrenfest marcel grossmann j nos plesch maurice solovine and stephen wise 48 patent office olympia academy founders conrad habicht maurice solovine and einstein after graduating in 1900 einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post he acquired swiss citizenship in february 1901 49 but was not conscripted for medical reasons with the help of marcel grossmann s father he secured a job in bern at the federal office for intellectual property the patent office 50 51 as an assistant examiner level iii 52 53 einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter 53 in 1903 his position at the swiss patent office became permanent although he was passed over for promotion until he fully mastered machine technology 54 370 much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time 54 377 with a few friends he had met in bern einstein started a small discussion group in 1902 self-mockingly named the olympia academy which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy their readings included the works of henri poincar ernst mach and david hume which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook 55 first scientific papers einstein s official 1921 portrait after receiving the nobel prize in physics in 1900 einstein s paper folgerungen aus den capillarit tserscheinungen conclusions from the capillarity phenomena was published in the journal annalen der physik 56 57 on 30 april 1905 einstein completed his thesis 58 with alfred kleiner professor of experimental physics serving as pro-forma advisor as a result einstein was awarded a phd by the university of z rich with his dissertation a new determination of molecular dimensions 58 59 in that same year which has been called einstein s annus mirabilis miracle year he published four groundbreaking papers on the photoelectric effect brownian motion special relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26 academic career by 1908 he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the university of bern the following year after giving a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the university of z rich alfred kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909 60 einstein became a full professor at the german charles-ferdinand university in prague in april 1911 accepting austrian citizenship in the austro-hungarian empire to do so 61 62 during his prague stay he wrote 11 scientific works five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids in july 1912 he returned to his alma mater in z rich from 1912 until 1914 he was professor of theoretical physics at the eth zurich where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics he also studied continuum mechanics the molecular theory of heat and the problem of gravitation on which he worked with mathematician and friend marcel grossmann 63 on 3 july 1913 he was voted for membership in the prussian academy of sciences in berlin max planck and walther nernst visited him the next week in zurich to persuade him to join the academy additionally offering him the post of director at the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics which was soon to be established 64 membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the humboldt university of berlin he was officially elected to the academy on 24 july and he accepted to move to the german empire the next year his decision to move to berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin elsa with whom he had developed a romantic affair he joined the academy and thus the berlin university on 1 april 1914 65 as world war i broke out that year the plan for kaiser wilhelm institute for physics was aborted the institute was established on 1 october 1917 with einstein as its director 66 in 1916 einstein was elected president of the german physical society 1916 1918 67 based on calculations einstein made in 1911 about his new theory of general relativity light from another star should be bent by the sun s gravity in 1919 that prediction was confirmed by sir arthur eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 may 1919 those observations were published in the international media making einstein world famous on 7 november 1919 the leading british newspaper the times printed a banner headline that read revolution in science new theory of the universe newtonian ideas overthrown 68 in 1920 he became a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences 69 in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect 10 while the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial the citation also does not treat the cited work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the planck spectrum by s n bose einstein was elected a foreign member of the royal society formemrs in 1921 4 he also received the copley medal from the royal society in 1925 4 1921 1922 travels abroad albert einstein at a session of the international committee on intellectual cooperation league of nations of which he was a member from 1922 to 1932 einstein visited new york city for the first time on 2 april 1921 where he received an official welcome by mayor john francis hylan followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions he went on to deliver several lectures at columbia university and princeton university and in washington he accompanied representatives of the national academy of science on a visit to the white house on his return to europe he was the guest of the british statesman and philosopher viscount haldane in london where he met several renowned scientific intellectual and political figures and delivered a lecture at king s college london 70 71 he also published an essay my first impression of the u s a in july 1921 in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of americans much as had alexis de tocqueville who published his own impressions in democracy in america 1835 72 for some of his observations einstein was clearly surprised what strikes a visitor is the joyous positive attitude to life the american is friendly self-confident optimistic and without envy 73 20 in 1922 his travels took him to asia and later to palestine as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour as he visited singapore ceylon and japan where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of japanese after his first public lecture he met the emperor and empress at the imperial palace where thousands came to watch in a letter to his sons he described his impression of the japanese as being modest intelligent considerate and having a true feel for art 74 because of einstein s travels to the far east he was unable to personally accept the nobel prize for physics at the stockholm award ceremony in december 1922 in his place the banquet speech was held by a german diplomat who praised einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist 75 on his return voyage he visited palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region he was greeted as if he were a head of state rather than a physicist which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the british high commissioner sir herbert samuel during one reception the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him in einstein s talk to the audience he expressed happiness that the jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world 76 einstein visited spain for two weeks in 1923 where he briefly met santiago ram n y cajal and also received a diploma from king alfonso xiii naming him a member of the spanish academy of sciences 77 from 1922 to 1932 einstein was involved in the works of the international committee on intellectual cooperation of the league of nations in geneva an organisation created to promote international exchange between scientists researchers teachers artists and intellectuals 78 his former physics professor hendrik lorentz and the french chemist marie curie were also members of this committee 1930 1931 travel to the u s in december 1930 einstein visited america for the second time originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the california institute of technology after the national attention he received during his first trip to the u s he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly he declined them all 79 after arriving in new york city einstein was taken to various places and events including chinatown a lunch with the editors of the new york times and a performance of carmen at the metropolitan opera where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival during the days following he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met the president of columbia university who described einstein as the ruling monarch of the mind 80 harry emerson fosdick pastor at new york s riverside church gave einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of einstein standing at the entrance 80 also during his stay in new york he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at madison square garden during a hanukkah celebration 80 einstein left and charlie chaplin at the hollywood premiere of city lights january 1931 einstein next traveled to california where he met caltech president and nobel laureate robert a millikan his friendship with millikan was awkward as millikan had a penchant for patriotic militarism where einstein was a pronounced pacifist 81 during an address to caltech s students einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good 82 this aversion to war also led einstein to befriend author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin both noted for their pacifism carl laemmle head of universal studios gave einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin they had an instant rapport with chaplin inviting einstein and his wife elsa to his home for dinner chaplin said einstein s outward persona calm and gentle seemed to conceal a highly emotional temperament from which came his extraordinary intellectual energy 83 320 chaplin s film city lights was to premiere a few days later in hollywood and chaplin invited einstein and elsa to join him as his special guests walter isaacson einstein s biographer described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity 82 chaplin visited einstein at his home on a later trip to berlin and recalled his modest little flat and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory chaplin speculated that it was possibly used as kindling wood by the nazis 83 322 1933 emigration to the u s cartoon of einstein who has shed his pacifism wings standing next to a pillar labeled world peace he is rolling up his sleeves and holding a sword labeled preparedness by charles r macauley c 1933 in february 1933 while on a visit to the united states einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germany s new chancellor adolf hitler 84 85 while at american universities in early 1933 he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena he and his wife elsa returned to belgium by ship in march and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated upon landing in antwerp on 28 march he immediately went to the german consulate and surrendered his passport formally renouncing his german citizenship 86 the nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a hitler youth camp 87 refugee status albert einstein s landing card 26 may 1933 when he landed in dover united kingdom from ostende belgium to visit oxford in april 1933 einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barring jews from holding any official positions including teaching at universities 86 historian gerald holton describes how with virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues thousands of jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed 73 a month later einstein s works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burnings with nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming jewish intellectualism is dead 86 one german magazine included him in a list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase not yet hanged offering a 5,000 bounty on his head 86 88 in a subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born who had already emigrated from germany to england einstein wrote i must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise 86 after moving to the u s he described the book burnings as a spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment and more than anything else in the world fear the influence of men of intellectual independence 89 einstein was now without a permanent home unsure where he would live and work and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany he rented a house in de haan belgium where he lived for a few months in late july 1933 he went to england for about six weeks at the personal invitation of british naval officer commander oliver locker-lampson who had become friends with einstein in the preceding years to protect einstein locker-lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside london with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding einstein published in the daily herald on 24 july 1933 90 91 locker-lampson took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home and later austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george 92 einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately and sent his friend physicist frederick lindemann to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities 93 churchill later observed that as a result of germany having driven the jews out they had lowered their technical standards and put the allies technology ahead of theirs 93 einstein later contacted leaders of other nations including turkey s prime minister smet n n to whom he wrote in september 1933 requesting placement of unemployed german-jewish scientists as a result of einstein s letter jewish invitees to turkey eventually totaled over 1,000 saved individuals 94 locker-lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein during which period einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe 95 in one of his speeches he denounced germany s treatment of jews while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting jewish citizenship in palestine as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere 96 in his speech he described einstein as a citizen of the world who should be offered a temporary shelter in the u k note 2 97 both bills failed however and einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the princeton institute for advanced study in the u s to become a resident scholar 95 resident scholar at the institute for advanced study portrait taken in 1935 in princeton in october 1933 einstein returned to the u s and took up a position at the institute for advanced study 95 98 noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany 99 at the time most american universities including harvard princeton and yale had minimal or no jewish faculty or students as a result of their jewish quota which lasted until the late 1940s 99 einstein was still undecided on his future he had offers from several european universities including christ church oxford where he stayed for three short periods between may 1931 and june 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship 100 101 but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship 95 102 einstein s affiliation with the institute for advanced study would last until his death in 1955 103 he was one of the four first selected two of the others being john von neumann and kurt g del at the new institute where he soon developed a close friendship with g del the two would take long walks together discussing their work bruria kaufman his assistant later became a physicist during this period einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics both unsuccessfully world war ii and the manhattan project in 1939 a group of hungarian scientists that included migr physicist le szil rd attempted to alert washington to ongoing nazi atomic bomb research the group s warnings were discounted einstein and szil rd along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wigner regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon 104 105 to make certain the u s was aware of the danger in july 1939 a few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe szil rd and wigner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs which einstein a pacifist said he had never considered 106 he was asked to lend his support by writing a letter with szil rd to president roosevelt recommending the u s pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research the letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the u s adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the u s entry into world war ii 107 in addition to the letter einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family 108 and the belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the white house s oval office some say that as a result of einstein s letter and his meetings with roosevelt the u s entered the race to develop the bomb drawing on its immense material financial and scientific resources to initiate the manhattan project for einstein war was a disease and he called for resistance to war by signing the letter to roosevelt some argue he went against his pacifist principles 109 in 1954 a year before his death einstein said to his old friend linus pauling i made one great mistake in my life when i signed the letter to president roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made but there was some justification the danger that the germans would make them 110 u s citizenship einstein accepting u s citizenship certificate from judge phillip forman einstein became an american citizen in 1940 not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture when compared to europe he recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased without social barriers and as a result individuals were encouraged he said to be more creative a trait he valued from his own early education 111 personal life supporter of civil rights einstein was a passionate committed antiracist and joined national association for the advancement of colored people naacp in princeton where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans he considered racism america s worst disease 88 seeing it as handed down from one generation to the next 112 as part of his involvement he corresponded with civil rights activist w e b du bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951 113 565 when einstein offered to be a character witness for du bois the judge decided to drop the case 114 einstein in 1947 in 1946 einstein visited lincoln university in pennsylvania a historically black college where he was awarded an honorary degree lincoln was the first university in the united states to grant college degrees to african americans alumni include langston hughes and thurgood marshall einstein gave a speech about racism in america adding i do not intend to be quiet about it 115 a resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student 114 assisting zionist causes einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the hebrew university of jerusalem which opened in 1925 and was among its first board of governors earlier in 1921 he was asked by the biochemist and president of the world zionist organization chaim weizmann to help raise funds for the planned university 116 he also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs among those he advised first creating an institute of agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land that should be followed he suggested by a chemical institute and an institute of microbiology to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria which he called an evil that was undermining a third of the country s development 117 161 establishing an oriental studies institute to include language courses given in both hebrew and arabic for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments was also important 117 158 chaim weizmann later became israel s first president upon his death while in office in november 1952 and at the urging of ezriel carlebach prime minister david ben-gurion offered einstein the position of president of israel a mostly ceremonial post 118 119 the offer was presented by israel s ambassador in washington abba eban who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons 120 einstein declined and wrote in his response that he was deeply moved and at once saddened and ashamed that he could not accept it 120 love of music einstein right with writer musician and nobel laureate rabindranath tagore 1930 einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age and later wrote if i were not a physicist i would probably be a musician i often think in music i live my daydreams in music i see my life in terms of music i get most joy in life out of music 121 122 his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into german culture according to conductor leon botstein einstein is said to have begun playing when he was 5 although he did not enjoy it at that age 123 when he turned 13 he discovered the violin sonatas of mozart whereupon einstein fell in love with mozart s music and studied music more willingly he taught himself to play without ever practicing systematically he said deciding that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty 123 at age 17 he was heard by a school examiner in aarau as he played beethoven s violin sonatas the examiner stating afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of great insight what struck the examiner writes botstein was that einstein displayed a deep love of the music a quality that was and remains in short supply music possessed an unusual meaning for this student 123 music took on a pivotal and permanent role in einstein s life from that period on although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time among those with whom einstein played chamber music were a few professionals and he performed for private audiences and friends chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in bern z rich and berlin where he played with max planck and his son among others he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the k chel catalogue of mozart s work that edition was prepared by alfred einstein who may have been a distant relation 124 125 in 1931 while engaged in research at the california institute of technology he visited the zoellner family conservatory in los angeles where he played some of beethoven and mozart s works with members of the zoellner quartet 126 127 near the end of his life when the young juilliard quartet visited him in princeton he played his violin with them and the quartet was impressed by einstein s level of coordination and intonation 123 political and religious views albert einstein with his wife elsa einstein and zionist leaders including future president of israel chaim weizmann his wife vera weizmann menahem ussishkin and ben-zion mossinson on arrival in new york city in 1921 einstein s political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism which he detailed in his essays such as why socialism 128 129 einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics 95 he strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation 130 the fbi created a secret dossier on einstein in 1932 and by the time of his death his fbi file was 1,427 pages long 131 einstein spoke of his religious outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews 132 einstein stated that he believed in the pantheistic god of baruch spinoza 133 he did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings a view which he described as na ve 134 he clarified however that i am not an atheist 135 preferring to call himself an agnostic 136 or a deeply religious nonbeliever 134 when asked if he believed in an afterlife einstein replied no and one life is enough for me 137 death on 17 april 1955 einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which had previously been reinforced surgically by rudolph nissen in 1948 138 he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of israel s seventh anniversary with him to the hospital but he did not live long enough to complete it 139 einstein refused surgery saying i want to go when i want it is tasteless to prolong life artificially i have done my share it is time to go i will do it elegantly 140 he died in princeton hospital early the next morning at the age of 76 having continued to work until near the end during the autopsy the pathologist of princeton hospital thomas stoltz harvey removed einstein s brain for preservation without the permission of his family in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent 141 einstein s remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location 142 143 in a memorial lecture delivered on 13 december 1965 at unesco headquarters nuclear physicist robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of einstein as a person he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness there was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn 144 scientific career throughout his life einstein published hundreds of books and articles 14 5 he published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones 11 14 on 5 december 2014 universities and archives announced the release of einstein s papers comprising more than 30,000 unique documents 145 146 einstein s intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius 15 in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the bose einstein statistics the einstein refrigerator and others 147 1905 annus mirabilis papers the annus mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect which gave rise to quantum theory brownian motion the special theory of relativity and e mc2 that einstein published in the annalen der physik scientific journal in 1905 these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space time and matter the four papers are title translated area of focus received published significance on a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light photoelectric effect 18 march 9 june resolved an unsolved puzzle by suggesting that energy is exchanged only in discrete amounts quanta 148 this idea was pivotal to the early development of quantum theory 149 on the motion of small particles suspended in a stationary liquid as required by the molecular kinetic theory of heat brownian motion 11 may 18 july explained empirical evidence for the atomic theory supporting the application of statistical physics on the electrodynamics of moving bodies special relativity 30 june 26 september reconciled maxwell s equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light resulting from analysis based on empirical evidence that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the observer 150 discredited the concept of a luminiferous ether 151 does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content matter energy equivalence 27 september 21 november equivalence of matter and energy e mc2 and by implication the ability of gravity to bend light the existence of rest energy and the basis of nuclear energy thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics einstein s first paper 152 submitted in 1900 to annalen der physik was on capillary attraction it was published in 1901 with the title folgerungen aus den capillarit tserscheinungen which translates as conclusions from the capillarity phenomena two papers he published in 1902 1903 thermodynamics attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view these papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on brownian motion which showed that brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist his research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena 152 general principles he articulated the principle of relativity this was understood by hermann minkowski to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time other principles postulated by einstein and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence general covariance and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number theory of relativity and e mc einstein s zur elektrodynamik bewegter k rper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year it reconciles maxwell s equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light this later became known as einstein s special theory of relativity consequences of this include the time space frame of a moving body appearing to slow down and contract in the direction of motion when measured in the frame of the observer this paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time was superfluous 153 in his paper on mass energy equivalence einstein produced e mc2 from his special relativity equations 154 einstein s 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years but was accepted by leading physicists starting with max planck 155 156 photons and energy quanta the photoelectric effect incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate bottom and eject electrons depicted as flying off to the right in a 1905 paper 157 einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles quanta einstein s light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists including max planck and niels bohr this idea only became universally accepted in 1919 with robert millikan s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect and with the measurement of compton scattering einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each where h is planck s constant he does not say much more because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave but he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results notably the photoelectric effect 157 quantized atomic vibrations in 1907 einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator in the einstein model each atom oscillates independently a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics peter debye refined this model 158 adiabatic principle and action-angle variables throughout the 1910s quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems after ernest rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets niels bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by planck and developed by einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms and the periodic table of the elements einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments wilhelm wien had made wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant arnold sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics wave particle duality einstein during his visit to the united states although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in 1906 he had not given up on academia in 1908 he became a privatdozent at the university of bern 159 in ber die entwicklung unserer anschauungen ber das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung the development of our views on the composition and essence of radiation on the quantization of light and in an earlier 1909 paper einstein showed that max planck s energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent point-like particles this paper introduced the photon concept although the name photon was introduced later by gilbert n lewis in 1926 and inspired the notion of wave particle duality in quantum mechanics einstein saw this wave particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new unified foundation theory of critical opalescence einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density at the critical point this derivative is zero leading to large fluctuations the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered making the fluid look milky white einstein relates this to rayleigh scattering which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength and which explains why the sky is blue 160 einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations and demonstrated how both the effect and rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter zero-point energy in a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913 planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his second quantum theory soon this idea attracted the attention of einstein and his assistant otto stern assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data the numbers matched nicely however after publishing the findings they promptly withdrew their support because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy 161 general relativity and the equivalence principle eddington s photograph of a solar eclipse general relativity gr is a theory of gravitation that was developed by einstein between 1907 and 1915 according to general relativity the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses general relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape as einstein later said the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion even accelerated ones should appear more satisfactory 162 consequently in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity in that article titled on the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it he argued that free fall is really inertial motion and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply this argument is called the equivalence principle in the same article einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation gravitational red shift and deflection of light 163 164 in 1911 einstein published another article on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light expanding on the 1907 article in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies thus the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally 165 gravitational waves in 1916 einstein predicted gravitational waves 166 167 ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves traveling outward from the source transporting energy as gravitational radiation the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it by contrast gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed the first indirect detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars psr b1913 16 168 the explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves 168 169 einstein s prediction was confirmed on 11 february 2016 when researchers at ligo published the first observation of gravitational waves 170 on earth exactly one hundred years after the prediction 168 171 172 173 174 hole argument and entwurf theory while developing general relativity einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only in june 1913 the entwurf draft theory was the result of these investigations as its name suggests it was a sketch of a theory less elegant and more difficult than general relativity with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions after more than two years of intensive work einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken 175 and abandoned the theory in november 1915 physical cosmology

the big bang theory religious interpretations of the big bang theory timeline of cosmological theories category cosmology portal astronomy portal v t in 1917 einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole 176 he discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic either contracting or expanding as observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time einstein introduced a new term the cosmological constant to the field equations in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe the modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature in accordance with einstein s understanding of mach s principle in these years this model became known as the einstein world or einstein s static universe 177 178 following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by edwin hubble in 1929 einstein abandoned his static model of the universe and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos the friedmann-einstein universe of 1931 179 180 and the einstein de sitter universe of 1932 181 182 in each of these models einstein discarded the cosmological constant claiming that it was in any case theoretically unsatisfactory 179 180 183 in many einstein biographies it is claimed that einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his biggest blunder the astrophysicist mario livio has recently cast doubt on this claim suggesting that it may be exaggerated 184 in late 2013 a team led by the irish physicist cormac o raifeartaigh discovered evidence that shortly after learning of hubble s observations of the recession of the nebulae einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe 185 186 in a hitherto overlooked manuscript apparently written in early 1931 einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter a process he associated with the cosmological constant 187 188 as he stated in the paper in what follows i would like to draw attention to a solution to equation 1 that can account for hubbel s sic facts and in which the density is constant over time if one considers a physically bounded volume particles of matter will be continually leaving it for the density to remain constant new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space it thus appears that einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before hoyle bondi and gold 189 190 however einstein s steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea 187 188 191 modern quantum theory newspaper headline on 4 may 1935 einstein was displeased with quantum theory and quantum mechanics a theory he had helped create despite its acceptance by other physicists stating that god is not playing at dice 192 einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76 193 in 1917 at the height of his work on relativity einstein published an article in physikalische zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser 194 this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with planck s distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws einstein discovered louis de broglie s work and supported his ideas which were received skeptically at first in another major paper from this era einstein gave a wave equation for de broglie waves which einstein suggested was the hamilton jacobi equation of mechanics this paper would inspire schr dinger s work of 1926 bose einstein statistics in 1924 einstein received a description of a statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles einstein noted that bose s statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles and submitted his translation of bose s paper to the zeitschrift f r physik einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications among them the bose einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures 195 it was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the nist jila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder 196 bose einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons einstein s sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university 147 energy momentum pseudotensor general relativity includes a dynamical spacetime so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum noether s theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a lagrangian with translation invariance but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noether s presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates he maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field this approach has been echoed by lev landau and evgeny lifshitz and others and has become standard the use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by erwin schr dinger and others unified field theory following his research on general relativity einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity in 1950 he described his unified field theory in a scientific american article titled on the generalized theory of gravitation 197 although he continued to be lauded for his work einstein became increasingly isolated in his research and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful in his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces which were not well understood until many years after his death mainstream physics in turn largely ignored einstein s approaches to unification einstein s dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting wormholes in 1935 einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce a model of a wormhole often called einstein rosen bridges 198 199 his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations in line with the program outlined in the paper do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches 200 if one end of a wormhole was positively charged the other end would be negatively charged these properties led einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way einstein cartan theory einstein at his office university of berlin 1920 in order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part called the torsion this modification was made by einstein and cartan in the 1920s equations of motion the theory of general relativity has a fundamental law the einstein equations which describe how space curves the geodesic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the einstein equations since the equations of general relativity are non-linear a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields like a black hole would move on a trajectory which is determined by the einstein equations themselves not by a new law so einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution like a black hole would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself this was established by einstein infeld and hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum and by roy kerr for spinning objects other investigations einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned these pertain to force superconductivity and other research collaboration with other scientists the 1927 solvay conference in brussels a gathering of the world s top physicists einstein is in the center in addition to longtime collaborators leopold infeld nathan rosen peter bergmann and others einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists einstein de haas experiment einstein and de haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons nowadays known to be the spin in order to show this they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate because the electron s angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes this experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization schr dinger gas model einstein suggested to erwin schr dinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a bose einstein gas by considering a box then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator quantizing these oscillators each level will have an integer occupation number which will be the number of particles in it this formulation is a form of second quantization but it predates modern quantum mechanics erwin schr dinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas schr dinger urged einstein to add his name as co-author although einstein declined the invitation 201 einstein refrigerator in 1926 einstein and his former student le szil rd co-invented and in 1930 patented the einstein refrigerator this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input 202 on 11 november 1930 was awarded to einstein and le szil rd for the refrigerator their invention was not immediately put into commercial production and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the swedish company electrolux 203 bohr versus einstein einstein and niels bohr 1925 the bohr einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between einstein and niels bohr who were two of its founders their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science 204 205 206 their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics einstein podolsky rosen paradox in 1935 einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics he considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other he noted along with his collaborators that by performing different measurements on the distant particle either of position or momentum different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way he then used a hypothesis of local realism to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined the principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be without in any way disturbing the particle then the particle actually has values of position or momentum this principle distilled the essence of einstein s objection to quantum mechanics as a physical principle it was shown to be incorrect when the aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed bell s theorem which had been promulgated in 1964 non-scientific legacy while traveling einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted stepdaughters margot and ilse the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the hebrew university margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death she died in 1986 207 einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the plumbers and steamfitters union 208 209 barbara wolff of the hebrew university s albert einstein archives told the bbc that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955 210 corbis successor to the roger richman agency licenses the use of his name and associated imagery as agent for the university 211 in popular culture in the period before world war ii the new yorker published a vignette in their the talk of the town feature saying that einstein was so well known in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain that theory he finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries he told his inquirers pardon me sorry always i am mistaken for professor einstein 212 einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels films plays and works of music 213 he is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent-minded professors his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated time magazine s frederic golden wrote that einstein was a cartoonist s dream come true 214 awards and honors einstein received numerous awards and honors and in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect none of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by alfred nobel so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to einstein in 1922 10 publications the following publications by einstein are referenced in this article a more complete
