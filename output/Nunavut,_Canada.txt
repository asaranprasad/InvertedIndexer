population for approximately 4,000 years most historians identify the coast of baffin island with the helluland described in norse sagas so it is possible that the inhabitants of the region had occasional contact with norse sailors archaeological findings edit in september 2008 researchers reported on the evaluation of existing and newly excavated archaeological remains including yarn spun from a hare rats tally sticks a carved wooden face mask that depicts caucasian features and possible architectural material the materials were collected in five seasons of excavation at cape tanfield scholars determined that these provide evidence of european traders and possibly settlers on baffin island not later than 1000 ce and thus older than or contemporaneous with l anse aux meadows they seem to indicate prolonged contact possibly up to 1450 the origin of the old world contact is unclear the article states dating of some yarn and other artifacts presumed to be left by vikings on baffin island have produced an age that predates the vikings by several hundred years so you have to consider the possibility that as remote as it may seem these finds may represent evidence of contact with europeans prior to the vikings arrival in greenland 19 inuit village near frobisher bay 1865 first written historical accounts edit the written historical accounts of nunavut begin in 1576 with an account by english explorer martin frobisher while leading an expedition to find the northwest passage frobisher thought he had discovered gold ore around the body of water now known as frobisher bay on the coast of baffin island 20 the ore turned out to be worthless but frobisher made the first recorded european contact with the inuit other explorers in search of the elusive northwest passage followed in the 17th century including henry hudson william baffin and robert bylot cold war edit cornwallis and ellesmere islands featured in the history of the cold war in the 1950s concerned about the area s strategic geopolitical position the federal government relocated inuit from nunavik northern quebec to resolute and grise fiord in the unfamiliar and hostile conditions they faced starvation 21 but were forced to stay 22 forty years later the royal commission on aboriginal peoples issued a report titled the high arctic relocation a report on the 1953 55 relocation 23 the government paid compensation to those affected and their descendents and on august 18 2010 in inukjuak nunavik the honourable john duncan pc mp previous minister of indian affairs

polished banded coloured marble on baffin island recent history edit discussions on dividing the northwest territories along ethnic lines began in the 1950s and legislation to do this was introduced in 1963 after its failure a federal commission recommended against such a measure 26 in 1976 as part of the land claims negotiations between the inuit tapiriit kanatami then called the inuit tapirisat of canada and the federal government the parties discussed division of the northwest territories to provide a separate territory for the inuit on april 14 1982 a plebiscite on division was held throughout the northwest territories a majority of the residents voted in favour and the federal government gave a conditional agreement seven months later 27 the land claims agreement was completed in september 1992 and ratified by nearly 85 of the voters in nunavut in a referendum on july 9 1993 the nunavut land claims agreement act 10 and the nunavut act 9 were passed by the canadian

of eleven elders whose function it is to help incorporate inuit qaujimajatuqangit inuit culture and traditional knowledge often referred to in english as iq into the territory s political and governmental decisions 49 due to the territory s small population and the fact that there are only a few hundred voters in each electoral district the possibility of two election candidates finishing

in rankin inlet south in the nunavut general election 2013 in such an event nunavut s practice is to schedule a follow-up by-election rather than choosing the winning candidate by an arbitrary method the territory has also had numerous instances where mlas were directly acclaimed to office as the only person to register their candidacy by the deadline as well as one instance where a follow-up

regulated alcohol market it is the last outpost of prohibition in canada and it is often easier to obtain firearms than alcohol 62 every community in nunavut has slightly differing regulations but as a whole it is still very restrictive seven communities have bans against alcohol and another 14 have orders being restricted by local committees because of these laws a lucrative bootlegging market has appeared where people mark up the prices of bottles by extraordinary amounts 63 the rcmp estimate nunavut s bootleg liquor market rakes in some 10 million a year 62 despite the restrictions alcohol s availability leads to widespread alcohol related crime one lawyer estimated some 95 of police calls are alcohol-related 64 alcohol is also believed to be a contributing factor to the territory s high rates of violence suicide and homicide a special task force created in 2010 to study and address the territory s increasing alcohol-related problems recommended the government ease
