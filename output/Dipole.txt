top and a south magnetic pole at the bottom by comparison earth has a south magnetic pole near its north geographic pole and a north magnetic pole near its south pole in electromagnetism there are two kinds of dipoles an electric dipole is a separation of positive and negative charges the simplest example of this is a pair of electric charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign separated by some usually small distance a permanent electric dipole is called an electret a magnetic dipole is a closed circulation of electric current a simple example of this is a single loop of wire with some constant current through it 1 2 dipoles can be characterized by their dipole moment a vector quantity for the simple electric dipole given above the electric dipole moment points from the negative charge towards the positive charge and has a magnitude equal to the strength of each charge times the separation between the charges to be precise for the definition of the dipole moment one should always consider the dipole limit where for example the distance of the generating charges should converge to 0 while simultaneously the charge strength should diverge to infinity in such a way that the product remains a positive constant for the current loop the magnetic dipole moment points through the loop according to the right hand grip rule with a magnitude equal to the current in the loop times the area of the loop in addition to current loops the electron among other fundamental particles has a magnetic dipole moment that is because it generates a magnetic field that is identical to that generated by a very small current loop however the electron s magnetic moment is not due to a current loop but is instead an intrinsic property of the electron 3 it is also possible that the electron has an electric dipole moment although it has not yet been observed see electron electric dipole moment for more information contour plot of the electrostatic potential of a horizontally oriented electrical dipole of finite size strong colors indicate highest and lowest potential where the opposing charges of the dipole are located a permanent magnet such as a bar magnet owes its magnetism to the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment of the electron the two ends of a bar magnet are referred to as poles not to be confused with monopoles and may be labeled north and south in terms of the earth s magnetic field they are respectively north-seeking and south-seeking poles if the magnet were freely suspended in the earth s magnetic field the north-seeking pole would point towards the north and the south-seeking pole would point towards the south the dipole moment of the bar magnet points from its magnetic south to its magnetic north pole the north pole of a bar magnet in a compass points north however that means that earth s geomagnetic north pole is the south pole south-seeking pole of its dipole moment and vice versa the only known mechanisms for the creation of magnetic dipoles are by current loops or quantum-mechanical spin since the existence of magnetic monopoles has never been experimentally demonstrated the term comes from the greek dis twice 4 and polos axis 5

a finite distance magnetic field lines of a ring current of finite diameter field lines of a point dipole of any type electric magnetic acoustic etc a physical dipole consists of two equal and opposite point charges in the literal sense two poles its field at large distances i e distances large in comparison to the separation of the poles depends almost entirely on the dipole moment as defined above a point electric dipole is the limit obtained by letting the separation tend to 0 while keeping the dipole moment fixed the field of a point dipole has a particularly simple form and the order-1 term in the multipole expansion is precisely the point dipole field although there are no known magnetic monopoles in nature there are magnetic dipoles in the form of the quantum-mechanical spin associated with particles such as electrons although the accurate description of such effects falls outside of classical electromagnetism a theoretical magnetic point dipole has a magnetic field of exactly the same form as the electric field of an electric point dipole a very small current-carrying loop is approximately a magnetic point dipole the magnetic dipole moment of such a loop is the product of the current flowing in the loop and the vector area of the loop any configuration of charges or currents has a dipole moment which describes the dipole whose field is the best approximation at large distances to that of the given configuration this is simply one term in the multipole expansion when the total charge monopole moment is 0 as it always is for the magnetic case since there are no magnetic monopoles the dipole term is the dominant one at large distances its field falls off in proportion to 1 r3 as compared to 1 r4 for the next quadrupole term and higher powers of 1 r for higher terms or 1 r2 for the monopole term molecular dipoles edit many molecules have such dipole moments due to non-uniform distributions of positive and negative charges on the various atoms such is the case with polar compounds like hydrogen fluoride hf where electron density is shared unequally between atoms therefore a molecule s dipole is an electric dipole with an inherent electric field which should not be confused with a magnetic dipole which generates a magnetic field the physical chemist peter j w debye was the first scientist to study molecular dipoles extensively and as a consequence dipole moments are measured in units named debye in his honor for molecules there are three types of dipoles permanent dipoles these occur when two atoms in a molecule have substantially different electronegativity one atom attracts electrons more than another becoming more negative while the other atom becomes more positive a molecule with a permanent dipole moment is called a polar molecule see dipole dipole attractions instantaneous dipoles these occur due to chance when electrons happen to be more concentrated in one place than another in a molecule creating a temporary dipole see instantaneous dipole induced dipoles these can occur when one molecule with a permanent dipole repels another molecule s electrons inducing a dipole moment in that molecule a molecule is polarized when it carries an induced dipole see induced-dipole attraction more generally an induced dipole of any polarizable charge distribution remember that a molecule has a charge distribution is caused by an electric field external to this field may for instance originate from an ion or polar molecule in the vicinity of or may be macroscopic e g a molecule between the plates of a charged capacitor the size of the induced dipole moment is equal to the product of the strength of the external field and the dipole polarizability of dipole moment values can be obtained from measurement of the dielectric constant some typical gas phase values in debye units are 7 carbon dioxide 0 carbon monoxide 0.112 d ozone 0.53 d phosgene 1.17 d water vapor 1.85 d hydrogen cyanide 2.98 d cyanamide 4.27 d potassium bromide 10.41 d the linear molecule co 2 has a zero dipole as the two bond dipoles cancel kbr has one of the highest dipole moments because it is an ionic compound that exists as a molecule in the gas phase the bent molecule h 2o has a net dipole the two bond dipoles do not cancel the overall dipole moment of a molecule may be approximated as a vector sum of bond dipole moments as a vector sum it depends on the relative orientation of the bonds so that from the dipole moment information can be deduced about the molecular geometry for example the zero dipole of co2 implies that the two c o bond dipole moments cancel so that the molecule must be linear for h2o the o h bond moments do not cancel because the molecule is bent for ozone o3 which is also a bent molecule the bond dipole moments are not zero even though the o o bonds are between similar atoms this agrees with the lewis structures for the resonance forms of ozone which show a positive charge on the central oxygen atom an example in organic chemistry of the role of geometry in determining dipole moment is the cis and trans isomers of 1,2-dichloroethene in the cis isomer the two polar c cl bonds are on the same side of the c c double bond and the molecular dipole moment is 1.90 d in the trans isomer the dipole moment is zero because the two c cl bonds are on opposite sides of the c c and cancel and the two bond moments for the much less polar c h bonds also cancel cis isomer dipole moment 1.90 d trans isomer dipole moment zero another example of the role of molecular geometry is boron trifluoride which has three polar bonds with a difference in electronegativity greater than the traditionally cited threshold of 1.7 for ionic bonding however due to the equilateral triangular distribution of the fluoride ions about the boron cation center the molecule as a whole does not exhibit any identifiable pole one cannot construct a plane that divides the molecule into a net negative part and a net positive part quantum

that the expectation value changes sign under inversion we used here the fact that i displaystyle mathfrak i being a symmetry operator is unitary i 1 i displaystyle mathfrak i -1 mathfrak i and by definition the hermitian adjoint i displaystyle mathfrak i may be moved from bra to ket and then becomes i i displaystyle mathfrak i mathfrak i since the only quantity that is equal to minus itself is the zero the expectation value vanishes p 0 displaystyle langle mathfrak p rangle 0 in the case of open-shell atoms with degenerate energy levels one could define a dipole moment by the aid of the first-order stark effect this gives a non-vanishing dipole by definition proportional to a non-vanishing first-order stark shift only if some of the wavefunctions belonging to the degenerate energies have opposite parity i e have different behavior under inversion this is a rare occurrence but happens for the excited h-atom where 2s and 2p states are accidentally degenerate see article laplace

electric field is defined as the direction of the force on a positive charge electric field lines point away from a positive charge and toward a negative charge when placed in an electric or magnetic
