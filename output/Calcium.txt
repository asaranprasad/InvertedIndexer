wikidata calcium is a chemical element with symbol ca and atomic number 20 an alkaline earth metal calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium it is the fifth most abundant element in earth s crust and the third most abundant metal after iron and aluminium the most common calcium compound on earth is calcium carbonate found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life gypsum anhydrite fluorite and apatite are also sources of calcium the name derives from latin calx lime which was obtained from heating limestone its compounds were known to the ancients though their chemistry was unknown until the seventeenth century it was isolated by humphry davy in 1808 via electrolysis of its oxide who named the element while the pure metal does not have many applications due to its high reactivity it is often used as an alloying component in small quantities in steelmaking and calcium lead alloys are sometimes used in automotive batteries calcium compounds on the other hand are very widely used in many industries for example they are used in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation in the paper industry as bleaches in cement in the manufacture of soaps and as electrical insulators calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the human body and the most abundant metal calcium ions play a vital role in the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes they play an important role in signal transduction pathways where they act as a second messenger in neurotransmitter release from neurons in contraction of all muscle cell types and in fertilization many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes as well as proper bone formation contents 1 characteristics

bibliography 10 external links characteristics classification calcium is a very ductile silvery metal with a pale yellow tint whose properties are very similar to the heavier elements in its group strontium barium and radium a calcium atom has twenty electrons arranged in the electron configuration ar 4s2 like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas in this case argon hence calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds which are usually ionic hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal because the enthalpy of formation of mx2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical mx this occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged ca2 cation compared to the hypothetical ca cation 5 calcium is considered to be an alkaline earth metal along with these heavier elements and the lighter beryllium and magnesium nevertheless there are significant differences in chemical and physical properties between beryllium and magnesium which behave more like aluminium and zinc respectively and have some of the weaker metallic character of the post-transition metals and the group members from calcium onwards which traditionally led to alkaline earth metal only applying to the latter group 6 this classification is mostly obsolete in english-language sources but is still used in other countries such as japan 7 as a result comparisons with strontium and barium are more germane to calcium chemistry than comparisons with magnesium 5 physical calcium metal melts at 842 c and boils at 1494 c higher than its adjacent group 2 metals do it crystallises in the face-centered cubic arrangement like strontium above 450 c it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal close-packed arrangement like magnesium the density of 1.55 g cm 3 is the lowest in its group with others decreasing towards it 5 calcium can be cut with a knife with effort although it is still harder than lead while calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density 8 although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen its use as a conductor in space has been considered 9 chemical structure of the polymeric ca h 2o 6 2 center in hydrated calcium chloride illustrating the high coordination number typical for calcium complexes the chemistry of calcium is that of a typical heavy alkaline earth metal for example calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas it also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride 10 when finely divided it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride in bulk calcium is less reactive it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air but below 30 relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature 11 besides the simple oxide cao the peroxide cao2 can be made by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide ca o2 2 12 calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 is a strong base though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium barium or the alkali metals 13 all four dihalides of calcium are known 14 calcium carbonate caco3 and calcium sulfate caso4 are particularly abundant minerals 15 like strontium and barium as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution 5 due to the large size of the ca2 ion high coordination numbers are common up to 24 in some intermetallic compounds such as cazn13 16 calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as edta and polyphosphates which are useful in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from hard water in the absence of steric hindrance smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed 15 although calcium is in the same group as magnesium and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive although they have recently been investigated as possible catalysts 17 18 19 20 21 organocalcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoytterbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of yb2 102 pm and ca2 100 pm most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures bulky ligands tend to favor stability for example calcium dicyclopentadienyl ca c5h5 2 must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself replacing the c5h5 ligand with the bulkier c5 ch3 5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound s solubility volatility and kinetic stability 22 isotopes natural calcium is a mixture of five stable isotopes 40ca 42ca 43ca 44ca and 46ca and one isotope with a half-life so long that it can be considered stable for all practical purposes 48ca with a half-life of about 4.3 1019 years calcium is the first lightest element to have six naturally occurring isotopes 10 by far the most common isotope of calcium in nature is 40ca which makes up 96.941 of all natural calcium it is produced in the silicon-burning process from fusion of alpha particles and is the heaviest stable nuclide with equal proton and neutron numbers its occurrence is also supplemented slowly by the decay of primordial 40k adding another alpha particle would lead to unstable 44ti which quickly decays via two successive electron captures to stable 44ca this makes up 2.806 of all natural calcium and is the second-most common isotope the other four natural isotopes 42ca 43ca 46ca and 48ca are significantly rarer each comprising less than 1 of all natural calcium the four lighter isotopes are mainly products of the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes leaving the two heavier ones to be produced via neutron-capturing processes 46ca is mostly produced in a hot s-process as its formation requires a rather high neutron flux to allow short-lived 45ca to capture a neutron 48ca is produced by electron capture in the r-process in type ia supernovae where high neutron excess and low enough entropy ensures its survival 23 24 46ca and 48ca are the first classically stable nuclides with a six-neutron or eight-neutron excess respectively although extremely neutron-rich for such a light element 48ca is very stable because it is a doubly magic nucleus having 20 protons and 28 neutrons arranged in closed shells its beta decay to 48sc is very hindered because of the gross mismatch of nuclear spin 48ca has zero nuclear spin being even even while 48sc has spin 6 so the decay is forbidden by the conservation of angular momentum while two excited states of 48sc are available for decay as well they are also forbidden due to their high spins as a result when 48ca does decay it does so by double beta decay to 48ti instead being the lightest nuclide known to undergo double beta decay 25 26 the heavy isotope 46ca can also theoretically undergo double beta decay to 46ti as well but this has never been observed the lightest and most common isotope 40ca is also doubly magic and could undergo double electron capture to 40ar but this has likewise never been observed calcium is the only element to have two primordial doubly magic isotopes the experimental lower limits for the half-lives of 40ca and 46ca are 5.9 1021 years and 2.8 1015 years respectively 25 apart from the practically stable 48ca the longest lived radioisotope of calcium is 41ca it decays by electron capture to stable 41k with a half-life of about a hundred thousand years its existence in the early solar system as an extinct radionuclide has been inferred from excesses of 41k traces of 41ca also still exist today as it is a cosmogenic nuclide continuously reformed through neutron activation of natural 40ca 24 many other calcium radioisotopes are known ranging from 34ca to 57ca they are all much shorter-lived than 41ca the most stable among them being 45ca half-life 163 days and 47ca half-life 4.54 days the isotopes lighter than 42ca usually undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of potassium and those heavier than 44ca usually undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of scandium although near the nuclear drip lines proton emission and neutron emission begin to be significant decay modes as well 25 like other elements a variety of processes alter the relative abundance of calcium isotopes 27 the best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent fractionation of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals such as calcite aragonite and apatite from solution lighter isotopes are preferentially incorporated into these minerals leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly 0.025 per atomic mass unit amu at room temperature mass-dependent differences in calcium isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes usually 44ca 40ca in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material 44ca 40ca varies by about 1 among common earth materials 28 history one of the ain ghazal statues made from lime plaster calcium compounds were known for millennia although their chemical makeup was not understood until the 17th century 29 lime as a building material 30 and as plaster for statues was used as far back as around 7000 bc 31 the first dated lime kiln dates back to 2500 bc and was found in khafajah mesopotamia 32 33 at about the same time dehydrated gypsum caso4 2h2o was being used in the great pyramid of giza this material would later be used for the plaster in the tomb of tutankhamun the climate of present-day italy being warmer than that of egypt the ancient romans instead used lime mortars made by heating limestone caco3 the name calcium itself derives from the latin word calx lime 29 vitruvius noted that the lime that resulted was lighter than the original limestone attributing this to the boiling of the water in 1755 joseph black proved that this was due to the loss of carbon dioxide which as a gas had not been recognised by the ancient romans 34 in 1787 antoine lavoisier suspected that lime might be an oxide of a fundamental chemical element in his table of the elements lavoisier listed five salifiable earths i e ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts salis salt in latin chaux calcium oxide magn sie magnesia magnesium oxide baryte barium sulfate alumine alumina aluminium oxide and silice silica silicon dioxide about these elements lavoisier speculated we are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses are incapable hitherto of being reduced to a metallic state and consequently being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds are confounded with earths it is extremely probable that barytes which we have just now arranged with earths is in this situation for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies it is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds irreducible by any hitherto known process 35 calcium along with its congeners magnesium strontium and barium was first isolated by humphry davy in 1808 following the work of j ns jakob berzelius and magnus martin af pontin on electrolysis davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury ii oxide on a platinum plate which was used as the anode the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury electrolysis then gave calcium mercury and magnesium mercury amalgams and distilling off the mercury gave the metal 29 36 however pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later 34 occurrence and production travertine terraces in pamukkale turkey at 3 calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the earth s crust and the third most abundant metal behind aluminium and iron 29 it is also the fourth most abundant element in the lunar highlands 11 sedimentary calcium carbonate deposits pervade the earth s surface as fossilised remains of past marine life they occur in two forms the rhombohedral calcite more common and the orthorhombic aragonite forming in more temperate seas minerals of the first type include limestone dolomite marble chalk and iceland spar aragonite beds make up the bahamas the florida keys and the red sea basins corals sea shells and pearls are mostly made up of calcium carbonate among the other important minerals of calcium are gypsum caso4 2h2o anhydrite caso4 fluorite caf2 and apatite ca5 po4 3f 29 the major producers of calcium are china about 10000 to 12000 tonnes per year russia about 6000 to 8000 tonnes per year and the united states about 2000 to 4000 tonnes per year canada and france are also among the minor producers in 2005 about 24000 tonnes of calcium were produced about half of the world s extracted calcium is used by the united states with about 80 of the output used each year 9 in russia and china davy s method of electrolysis is still used but is instead applied to molten calcium chloride 9 since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium the oxide nitride coating that results in air is stable and lathe machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium 37 in the united states and canada calcium is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium metal at high temperatures 9 geochemical cycling calcium provides a link between tectonics climate and the carbon cycle in the simplest terms uplift of mountains exposes calcium-bearing rocks to chemical weathering and releases ca2 into surface water these ions are transported to the ocean where they react with dissolved co2 to form limestone which in turn settles to the sea floor where it is incorporated into new rocks dissolved co2 along with carbonate and bicarbonate ions are termed dissolved inorganic carbon dic 38 the actual reaction is more complicated and involves the bicarbonate ion hco 3 that forms when co2 reacts with water at seawater ph ca2 2 hco 3 caco 3 limestone co 2 h 2o at seawater ph most of the co2 is immediately converted back into hco 3 the reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of co2 from the ocean atmosphere into the lithosphere 39 the result is that each ca2 ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one co2 molecule from the surficial system atmosphere ocean soils and living organisms storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years the weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs co2 from the ocean and atmosphere exerting a strong long-term effect on climate 38 uses the largest use of calcium is in steelmaking due to its strong chemical affinity for oxygen and sulfur its oxides and sulfides once formed give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out on treatment these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical improving castability cleanliness and general mechanical properties calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries in which the use of 0.1 calcium lead alloys instead of the usual antimony lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging due to the risk of expansion and cracking aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys these lead calcium alloys are also used in casting replacing lead antimony alloys 40 calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron and to remove bismuth impurities from lead 37 calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins for example those in hair that block drains 41 besides metallurgy the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen it is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium zirconium thorium and uranium it can also be used to store hydrogen gas as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted 37 calcium isotope fractionation during mineral formation has led to several applications of calcium isotopes in particular the 1997 observation by skulan and depaolo 42 that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate is the basis of analogous applications in medicine and in paleooceanography in animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral in humans changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine have been shown to be related to changes in bone mineral balance when the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption the 44ca 40ca ratio in soft tissue rises and vice versa because of this relationship calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis 43 a similar system exists in seawater where 44ca 40ca tends to rise when the rate of removal of ca2 by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean in 1997 skulan and depaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater 44ca 40ca over geologic time along with a theoretical explanation of these changes more recent papers have confirmed this observation demonstrating that seawater ca2 concentration is not constant and that the ocean is never in a steady state with respect to calcium input and output this has important climatological implications as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the carbon cycle 44 45 many calcium compounds are used in food as pharmaceuticals and in medicine among others for example calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate calcium diphosphate and tricalcium phosphate the last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids calcium lactobionate is a white powder that is used as a suspending agent for pharmaceuticals in baking calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins

51 years 1000 pregnancy 1000 lactation 1000 calcium is an essential element needed in large quantities the ca2 ion acts as an electrolyte and is vital to the health of the muscular circulatory and digestive systems is indispensable to the building of bone and supports synthesis and function of blood cells for example it regulates the contraction of muscles nerve conduction and the clotting of blood as a result intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body calcium can play this role because the ca2 ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds especially proteins it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities enabling the formation of skeletons 47 calcium ions may be complexed by proteins through binding the carboxyl groups of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues through interacting with phosphorylated serine tyrosine or threonine residues or by being chelated by -carboxylated amino acid residues trypsin a digestive enzyme uses the first method osteocalcin a bone matrix protein uses the third some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both the first and the second direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface 47 as an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water 85 of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0 mm and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100 m 47 about three-quarters of dietary calcium is from dairy products and grains the rest being accounted for by vegetables protein-rich foods fruits sugar fats and oil calcium supplementation is controversial as the bioavailability of calcium is strongly dependent on the solubility of the salt involved calcium citrate malate and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so the intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys parathyroid hormone and vitamin d promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content when plasma calcium levels fall cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney gut and bone cells with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels 47 excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia but because of the inefficient absorption of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin d intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone it can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone this results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart the blood vessels and the kidneys symptoms include anorexia nausea vomiting memory loss confusion muscle weakness increased urination dehydration and metabolic bone disease chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification which can lead to serious consequences for example calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis likewise inadequate calcium or vitamin d intake results in hypocalcaemia often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells symptoms include neuromuscular excitability potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction 47 as calcium is heavily involved in bone manufacture many bone diseases can be traced to problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation for example osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume and can be treated by supplementation of calcium vitamin d and biphosphates calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease inadequate amounts of calcium vitamin d or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones known as osteomalacia 47 safety because calcium reacts exothermically with water and acids contact of calcium metal with bodily moisture results in severe corrosive irritation 48 when swallowed calcium metal has the same effect on the mouth oesophagus and stomach and can be fatal 41 however long-term exposure is not known to have distinct adverse effects 48 because of concerns of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones the u s institute of medicine iom and the european food safety authority efsa both set tolerable upper intake levels uls for the combination of dietary and supplemental calcium from the iom people ages 9 18 years are not supposed to exceed 3,000 mg day for ages 19 50 not to exceed 2,500 mg day for ages 51 and older not to exceed 2,000 mg day 49 the efsa set ul at 2,500 mg day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine uls
