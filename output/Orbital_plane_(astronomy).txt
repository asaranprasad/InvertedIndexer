https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy) orbital plane astronomy from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search an orbital plane as viewed relative to a plane of reference an orbital plane can also be seen in relative to conic sections in which the orbital path is defined as the intersection between a plane and a cone parabolic 1 and hyperbolic 3 orbits are escape orbits whereas elliptical and circular orbits 2 are captive the orbital plane of a revolving body is the geometric plane on which its orbit lies a common example would be the centers of a massive body of an orbiting body and of the orbiting object at another time the orbital plane is defined in relation to a reference plane by two parameters inclination i and longitude of the ascending node three non-collinear points in space suffice to determine the orbital plane by definition the reference plane for the solar system is usually considered to be earth s orbital plane this defines the ecliptic the circular path on the celestial sphere that the sun appears to follow over the course of a year in other cases for instance a moon or artificial satellite orbiting another planet it is convenient to define the inclination of the moon s orbit as the angle between its orbital plane and the planet s equatorial plane artificial satellites around the earth edit for launch vehicles and artificial satellites the orbital plane is a defining parameter of an orbit as in general it will take a very large amount of propellant to change the orbital plane of an object other parameters such as the orbital period the eccentricity of the orbit and the phase of the orbit are more easily changed by propulsion systems orbital planes of satellites are perturbed by the non-spherical nature of the earth s gravity this causes the orbital plane of the satellite s orbit to slowly rotate around the earth depending on the angle the plane makes with the earth s equator for planes that are at a critical angle this can mean that the plane will track the sun around the earth forming a sun-synchronous orbit a launch vehicle s launch window is usually determined by the times when the target orbital plane intersects the launch site see also edit earth-centered inertial coordinate system ecef earth-centered earth-fixed coordinate system invariable plane a weighted average of all orbital planes in a system orbital elements orbital state vectors references edit fundamentals of astrodynamics 1971 roger r bates donald d mueller jerry e white dover publications inc new york p.21 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title orbital plane astronomy oldid 819369955 categories orbits navigation menu search this page was last edited on 9 january 2018 at 00 24 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
