english channel and to the east by the county of devon over the river tamar which forms most of the border between them cornwall forms the westernmost part of the south west peninsula of the island of great britain the furthest southwestern point of the island is land s end the southernmost point is lizard point cornwall has a population of 556,000 and covers an area of 3,563 km2 1,376 sq mi 3 4 5 6 the county has been administered since 2009 by the unitary authority cornwall council the ceremonial county of cornwall also includes the isles of scilly which are administered separately the administrative centre of cornwall and its only city is truro cornwall is the homeland of the cornish people and the cultural and ethnic origin of the cornish diaspora it retains a distinct cultural identity that reflects its unique history and is recognised as one of the celtic nations with a rich cultural heritage 7 it was formerly a brythonic kingdom and subsequently a royal duchy the cornish nationalist movement contests the present constitutional status of cornwall and seeks greater autonomy within the united kingdom in the form of a devolved legislative cornish assembly and powers similar to those in wales and scotland 8 9 in 2014 cornish people were granted minority status under the european framework convention for the protection of national minorities 10 giving cornish people recognition as a distinct ethnic group 11 12 first inhabited in the palaeolithic and mesolithic periods cornwall continued to be occupied by neolithic and then bronze age peoples and later in the iron age by brythons with strong trade and cultural links to wales and brittany mining in cornwall and devon in the south west of england began in the early bronze age few roman remains have been found in cornwall and there is little evidence that the romans settled or had much military presence there citation needed after the collapse of the roman empire cornwall was ruled by chieftains of the cornovii which may have included semi-historical or legendary figures such as king mark of cornwall and king arthur evidenced by folklore traditions derived from the historia regum britanniae the cornovii division of the dumnonii tribe were separated from the brythons of wales after the battle of deorham and often came into conflict with the expanding kingdom of wessex king athelstan in ad 936 set the boundary between english and cornish at the high water mark of the eastern bank of the river tamar 13 from the early middle ages language and culture were shared by brythons trading across both sides of the channel resulting in the corresponding high medieval breton kingdoms of domnon e and cornouaille and the celtic christianity common to both areas historically tin mining in britain was important in the cornish economy becoming increasingly significant during the high middle ages and expanding greatly during the 19th century when rich copper mines were also in production in the mid-19th century however the tin and copper mines entered a period of decline subsequently china clay extraction became more important and metal mining had virtually ended by the 1990s traditionally fishing particularly of pilchards and agriculture notably dairy products and vegetables were the other important sectors of the economy railways led to a growth of tourism in the 20th century however cornwall s economy struggled after the decline of the mining and fishing industries citation needed cornwall is noted for its geology and coastal scenery a large part of the cornubian batholith is within cornwall the north coast has many cliffs where exposed geological formations are studied the area is noted for its wild moorland landscapes its long and varied coastline its attractive villages its many place-names derived from the cornish language and its very mild climate extensive stretches of cornwall s coastline and bodmin moor are protected as an area of outstanding natural beauty 14

a compound of two ancient demonyms coming from two different language groups corn- originates from the brythonic tribe the cornovii peninsula people the celtic word kernou horn or headland is cognate with the english word horn both deriving from the proto-indo-european ker- 15 16 17 18 a -wall derives from the old english exonym w e alh meaning foreigner or roman i e a welshman in the cornish language cornwall is known as kernow which stems from a similar linguistic background flag souvenir flags outside a cornish caf saint piran s flag is the national flag and ancient banner of cornwall 20 21 22 and an emblem of the cornish people it is regarded as the county flag by cornwall council the banner of saint piran is a white cross on a black background in terms of heraldry sable a cross argent according to legend saint piran adopted these colours from seeing the white tin in the black coals and ashes during his discovery of tin 20 23 the cornish flag is an exact reverse of the former breton national flag black cross and is known by the same name kroaz du 24 25 heraldry in later times cornwall was known to the anglo-saxons as west wales to distinguish it from north wales the modern nation of wales 26 the name appears in the anglo-saxon chronicle in 891 as on corn walum in the domesday book it was referred to as cornualia and in c 1198 as cornwal 27 b other names for the county include a latinisation of the name as cornubia first appears in a mid-9th-century deed purporting to be a copy of one dating from c 705 and as cornugallia in 1086 physical geography satellite image of cornwall cornwall forms the tip of the south-west peninsula of the island of great britain and is therefore exposed to the full force of the prevailing winds that blow in from the atlantic ocean the coastline is composed mainly of resistant rocks that give rise in many places to tall cliffs cornwall has a border with only one other county devon which is formed almost entirely by the river tamar and the remainder to the north by the marsland valley coastal areas the north and south coasts have different characteristics the north coast on the celtic sea part of the atlantic ocean is more exposed and therefore has a wilder nature the prosaically named high cliff between boscastle and st gennys is the highest sheer-drop cliff in cornwall at 223 metres 732 ft 29 however there are also many extensive stretches of fine golden sand which form the beaches that are so important to the tourist industry such as those at bude polzeath watergate bay perranporth porthtowan fistral beach newquay st agnes st ives and on the south coast gyllyngvase beach in falmouth and the large beach at praa sands further to the south west there are two river estuaries on the north coast hayle estuary and the estuary of the river camel which provides padstow and rock with a safe harbour the seaside town of newlyn is a popular holiday destination as it is one of the last remaining traditional cornish fishing ports with views reaching over mount s bay st michael s mount in marazion the south coast dubbed the cornish riviera is more sheltered and there are several broad estuaries offering safe anchorages such as at falmouth and fowey beaches on the south coast usually consist of coarser sand and shingle interspersed with rocky sections of wave-cut platform also on the south coast the picturesque fishing village of polperro at the mouth of the pol river and the fishing port of looe on the river looe are both popular with tourists inland areas the interior of the county consists of a roughly east west spine of infertile and exposed upland with a series of granite intrusions such as bodmin moor which contains the highest land within cornwall from east to west and with approximately descending altitude these are bodmin moor hensbarrow north of st austell carnmenellis to the south of camborne and the penwith or land s end peninsula these intrusions are the central part of the granite outcrops that form the exposed parts of the cornubian batholith of south-west britain which also includes dartmoor to the east in devon and the isles of scilly to the west the latter now being partially submerged cornwall is known for its beaches porthcurno beach illustrated and rugged coastline the intrusion of the granite into the surrounding sedimentary rocks gave rise to extensive metamorphism and mineralisation and this led to cornwall being one of the most important mining areas in europe until the early 20th century it is thought tin was mined here as early as the bronze age and copper lead zinc and silver have all been mined in cornwall alteration of the granite also gave rise to extensive deposits of china clay especially in the area to the north of st austell and the extraction of this remains an important industry the uplands are surrounded by more fertile mainly pastoral farmland near the south coast deep wooded valleys provide sheltered conditions for flora that like shade and a moist mild climate these areas lie mainly on devonian sandstone and slate the north east of cornwall lies on carboniferous rocks known as the culm measures in places these have been subjected to severe folding as can be seen on the north coast near crackington haven and in several other locations lizard peninsula the geology of the lizard peninsula is unusual in that it is mainland britain s only example of an ophiolite a section of oceanic crust now found on land c much of the peninsula consists of the dark green and red precambrian serpentinite which forms spectacular cliffs notably at kynance cove and carved and polished serpentine ornaments are sold in local gift shops this ultramafic rock also forms a very infertile soil which covers the flat and marshy heaths of the interior of the peninsula this is home to rare plants such as the cornish heath which has been adopted as the county flower 30 hills and high points settlements and transport truro cornwall s administrative centre and only city cornwall s only city and the home of the council headquarters is truro nearby falmouth is notable as a port st just in penwith is the westernmost town in england though the same claim has been made for penzance which is larger st ives and padstow are today small vessel ports with a major tourism and leisure sector in their economies newquay on the north coast is another major urban settlement which is famous for its beaches and is a popular surfing destination as is bude further north but newquay is now also becoming important for its aviation-related industries st austell is the county s largest town and more populous than the capital truro it was the centre of the china clay industry in cornwall redruth and camborne form the largest urban area in cornwall and both towns were significant as centres of the global tin mining industry in the 19th century nearby copper mines were also very productive during that period cornwall borders the county of devon at the river tamar major roads between cornwall and the rest of great britain are the a38 which crosses the tamar at plymouth via the tamar bridge and the town of saltash the a39 road atlantic highway from barnstaple passing through north cornwall to end in falmouth and the a30 which crosses the border south of launceston crosses bodmin moor and connects bodmin and truro torpoint ferry links plymouth with torpoint on the opposite side of the hamoaze a rail bridge the royal albert bridge built by isambard kingdom brunel 1859 provides the only other land transport link the city of plymouth a large urban centre in south west devon is an important location for services such as hospitals department stores road and rail transport and cultural venues particularly for people living in east cornwall cardiff and swansea across the bristol channel have at some times in the past been connected to cornwall by ferry but these do not operate now 31 the isles of scilly are served by ferry from penzance and by aeroplane having its own airport st mary s airport there are regular flights between st mary s and land s end airport near st just and cornwall airport newquay during the summer season a service is also provided between st mary s and exeter international airport in devon ecology flora and fauna cornwall has varied habitats including terrestrial and marine ecosystems one noted species in decline locally is the reindeer lichen which species has been made a priority for protection under the national uk biodiversity action plan 32 33 the red-billed chough pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax once commonly seen throughout cornwall experienced a severe decline in its population in the 20th century botanists divide cornwall and scilly into two vice-counties west 1 and east 2 the standard flora is by f h davey flora of cornwall 1909 davey was assisted by a o hume and he thanks hume his companion on excursions in cornwall and devon and for help in the compilation of that flora publication of which was financed by him climate cornwall has a temperate oceanic climate k ppen climate classification cfb and has the mildest and sunniest climate in the united kingdom as a result of its southerly latitude and the influence of the gulf stream 34 the average annual temperature in cornwall ranges from 11.6 c 52.9 f on the isles of scilly to 9.8 c 49.6 f in the central uplands winters are among the warmest in the country due to the southerly latitude and moderating effects of the warm ocean currents and frost and snow are very rare at the coast and in the central upland areas summers are however not as warm as in other parts of southern england citation needed the surrounding sea and its southwesterly position mean that cornwall s weather can be relatively changeable cornwall is one of the sunniest areas in the uk it has more than 1,541 hours of sunshine per year with the highest average of 7.6 hours of sunshine per day in july 35 the moist mild air coming from the southwest brings higher amounts of rainfall than in eastern great britain at 1,051 to 1,290 mm 41.4 to 50.8 in per year however this is not as much as in more northern areas of the west coast 36 the isles of scilly for example where there are on average fewer than two days of air frost per year is the only area in the uk to be in the hardiness zone 10 the islands have on average less than one day of air temperature exceeding 30 c per year and are in the ahs heat zone 1 extreme temperatures in cornwall are particularly rare however extreme weather in the form of storms and floods is common culture languages cornish language english is the main language used in cornwall although the revived cornish language is used and is spoken fluently by a small minority of people most street names and some road signs are written bilingually in cornish and english a welcome sign to penzance in the english and cornish languages the cornish language is a language from the brythonic branch of the celtic language family closely related to the other brythonic languages of welsh and breton and less so to the goidelic languages of irish scots gaelic and manx the language continued to function visibly as a community language in parts of cornwall until the late 18th century and it was claimed in 2011 that the last native speaker did not die until 1914 37 there has been a revival of the language since henry jenner s handbook of the cornish language was published in 1904 a study in 2000 suggested that there were around 300 people who spoke cornish fluently 38 cornish however had no legal status in the uk until 2002 nevertheless the language is taught in about twelve primary schools and occasionally used in religious and civic ceremonies 39 in 2002 cornish was officially recognised as a uk minority language 40 and in 2005 it received limited government funding 41 a standard written form was agreed in 2008 42 several cornish mining words are used in english language mining terminology such as costean gossan 43 gunnies kibbal 44 kieve 45 and vug 46 in the 2010 15 parliament of the united kingdom four cornish mps andrew george mp for st ives dan rogerson mp for north cornwall steve gilbert mp for st austell and newquay and sarah newton mp for truro and falmouth repeated their parliamentary oaths in cornish 47 english dialect the cornish language and culture influenced the emergence of particular pronunciations and grammar not used elsewhere in england the cornish dialect is spoken to varying degrees however someone speaking full anglo-cornish may be practically unintelligible to one not accustomed it cornish dialect has generally declined in most places it is now little more than a regional accent and grammatical differences have been eroded over time arts tate gallery at st ives artwork in the barbara hepworth museum in st ives since the 19th century cornwall with its unspoilt maritime scenery and strong light has sustained a vibrant visual art scene of international renown artistic activity within cornwall was initially centred on the art-colony of newlyn most active at the turn of the 20th

70 truro and all of the towns and some villages have football clubs belonging to the cornwall county football association rugby viewed as an important identifier of ethnic affiliation rugby union has become a sport strongly tied to notions of cornishness 71 and since the 20th century rugby union has emerged as one of the most popular spectator and team sports in cornwall perhaps the most popular with professional cornish rugby footballers being described as a formidable force 70 naturally independent both in thought and deed yet paradoxically staunch english patriots whose top players have represented england with pride and passion 72 in 1985 sports journalist alan gibson made a direct connection between love of rugby in cornwall and the ancient parish games of hurling and wrestling that existed for centuries before rugby officially began 72 among cornwall s native sports are a distinctive form of celtic wrestling related to breton wrestling and cornish hurling a kind of

strong culinary heritage surrounded on three sides by the sea amid fertile fishing grounds cornwall naturally has fresh seafood readily available newlyn is the largest fishing port in the uk by value of fish landed and is known for its wide range of restaurants 75 television chef rick stein has long operated a fish restaurant in padstow for this reason and jamie oliver chose to open his second restaurant fifteen in watergate bay near newquay masterchef host and founder of smiths of smithfield john torode in 2007 purchased seiners in perranporth one famous local fish dish is stargazy pie a fish-based pie in which the heads of the fish stick through the piecrust as though star-gazing the pie is cooked as part of traditional celebrations for tom bawcock s eve but is not generally eaten at any other time a cornish pasty cornwall is perhaps best known though for its pasties a savoury dish made with pastry today s pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak onion potato and swede with salt and white pepper but historically pasties had a variety of different fillings turmut tates and mate i e turnip potatoes and meat turnip being the cornish and scottish term for swede itself an abbreviation of swedish turnip the british term for rutabaga describes a filling once very common for instance the licky pasty contained mostly leeks and the herb pasty contained watercress parsley and shallots 76 pasties are often locally referred to as oggies historically pasties were also often made with sweet fillings such as jam apple and blackberry plums or cherries 77 the wet climate and relatively poor soil of cornwall make it unsuitable for growing many arable crops however it is ideal for growing the rich grass required for dairying leading to the production of cornwall s other famous export clotted cream this forms the basis for many local specialities including cornish fudge and cornish ice cream cornish clotted cream has protected geographical status under eu law 78 and cannot be made anywhere else its principal manufacturer is a e rodda son of scorrier local cakes and desserts include saffron cake cornish heavy hevva cake cornish fairings biscuits figgy obbin cream tea and whortleberry pie 79 80 81 there are also many types of beers brewed in cornwall those produced by sharp s brewery skinner s brewery keltek brewery and st austell brewery are the best-known including stouts ales and other beer types there is some small scale production of wine mead and cider history m n-an-tol prehistory roman and post-roman periods the present human history of cornwall begins with the reoccupation of britain after the last ice age the area now known as cornwall was first inhabited in the palaeolithic and mesolithic periods it continued to be occupied by neolithic and then bronze age people according to john t koch and others cornwall in the late bronze age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the atlantic bronze age in modern-day ireland england france spain and portugal 82 83 during the british iron age cornwall like all of britain south of the firth of forth was inhabited by a celtic people known as the britons with distinctive cultural relations to neighbouring wales and brittany the common brittonic spoken at the time eventually developed into several distinct tongues including cornish 84 the first account of cornwall comes from the 1st century bc sicilian greek historian diodorus siculus supposedly quoting or paraphrasing the 4th-century bce geographer pytheas who had sailed to britain the inhabitants of that part of britain called belerion or land s end from their intercourse with foreign merchants are civilised in their manner of life they prepare the tin working very carefully the earth in which it is produced here then the merchants buy the tin from the natives and carry it over to gaul and after travelling overland for about thirty days they finally bring their loads on horses to the mouth of the rh ne 85 celtic tribes of southern britain the identity of these merchants is unknown it has been theorised that they were phoenicians but there is no evidence for this 86 professor timothy champion discussing diodorus siculus s comments on the tin trade states that diodorus never actually says that the phoenicians sailed to cornwall in fact he says quite the opposite the production of cornish tin was in the hands of the natives of cornwall and its transport to the mediterranean was organised by local merchants by sea and then over land through france well outside phoenician control 87 for further discussion of tin mining see the section on the economy below there is little evidence that roman rule was effective west of exeter in devon and few roman remains have been found however after 410 cornwall appears to have reverted to rule by romano-celtic chieftains of the cornovii tribe as part of dumnonia including one marcus cunomorus with at least one significant power base at tintagel king mark of cornwall is a semi-historical figure known from welsh literature the matter of britain and in particular the later norman-breton medieval romance of tristan and yseult where he is regarded as a close relative of king arthur himself usually considered to be born of the cornish people in folklore traditions derived from geoffrey of monmouth s historia regum britanniae archaeology supports ecclesiastical literary and legendary evidence for some relative economic stability and close cultural ties between the sub-roman westcountry south wales brittany and ireland through the fifth and sixth centuries 88 conflict with wessex the battle of deorham in 577 saw the separation of dumnonia and therefore cornwall from wales following which the dumnonii often came into conflict with the expanding english kingdom of wessex the annales cambriae report that in 722 ad the britons of cornwall won a battle at hehil 89 it seems likely that the enemy the cornish fought was a west saxon force as evidenced by the naming of king ine of wessex and his kinsman nonna in reference to an earlier battle of lining in 710 90 the anglo-saxon chronicle stated in 815 adjusted date and in this year king ecgbryht raided in cornwall from east to west and thenceforth apparently held it as a ducatus or dukedom annexed to his regnum or kingdom of wessex but not wholly incorporated with it 91 the anglo-saxon chronicle states that in 825 adjusted date a battle took place between the wealas cornish and the defnas men of devon at gafulforda in the same year ecgbert as a later document expresses it disposed of their territory as it seemed fit to him giving a tenth part of it to god in other words he incorporated cornwall ecclesiastically with the west saxon diocese of sherborne and endowed eahlstan his fighting bishop who took part in the campaign with an extensive cornish estate consisting of callington and lawhitton both in the tamar valley and pawton near padstow in 838 the cornish and their danish allies were defeated by egbert in the battle of hingston down at hengestesdune probably hingston down in cornwall in 875 the last recorded king of cornwall dumgarth is said to have drowned 92 around the 880s anglo-saxons from wessex had established modest land holdings in the eastern part of cornwall notably alfred the great who had acquired a few estates 93 william of malmesbury writing around 1120 says that king athelstan of england 924 939 fixed the boundary between english and cornish people at the east bank of the river tamar 13 breton norman period the ancient hundreds of cornwall one interpretation of the domesday book is that by this time the native cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by english landowners particularly harold godwinson himself however the bodmin manumissions show that two leading cornish figures nominally had saxon names but these were both glossed with native cornish names 94 naming evidence cited by medievalist edith ditmas suggests that many post-conquest landowners in cornwall were breton allies of the normans 95 and further proposed this period for the early composition of the tristan and iseult cycle by poets such as beroul from a pre-existing shared brittonic oral tradition 96 soon after the norman conquest most of the land was transferred to the new breton norman aristocracy with the lion s share going to robert count of mortain half-brother of king william and the largest landholder in england after the king with his stronghold at trematon castle near the mouth of the tamar 97 cornwall and devon west of dartmoor showed a very different type of settlement pattern from that of saxon wessex and places continued even after 1066 to be named in the celtic cornish tradition with saxon architecture being uncommon citation needed later medieval administration and society subsequently however norman absentee landlords became replaced by a new cornu-norman elite including scholars such as richard rufus of cornwall these families eventually became the new ruling class of cornwall typically speaking norman french breton-cornish latin and eventually english many becoming involved in the operation of the stannary parliament system earldom and eventually the duchy 98 the cornish language continued to be spoken and it acquired a number of characteristics establishing its identity as a separate language from breton stannary parliaments the stannary parliaments and stannary courts were legislative and legal institutions in cornwall and in devon in the dartmoor area england the stannary courts administered equity for the region s tin-miners and tin mining interests and they were also courts of record for the towns dependent on the mines the separate and powerful government institutions available to the tin miners reflected the enormous importance of the tin industry to the english economy during the middle ages special laws for tin miners pre-date written legal codes in britain and ancient traditions exempted everyone connected with tin mining in cornwall and devon from any jurisdiction other than the stannary courts in all but the most exceptional circumstances piracy and smuggling cornish piracy was active during the elizabethan era on the west coast of britain 99 cornwall is well known for its wreckers who preyed on ships passing cornwall s rocky coastline during the 17th and 18th centuries cornwall was a major smuggling area politics and administration cornish national identity the percentage of respondents who gave cornish as an answer to the national identity question in the 2011 census cornwall is recognised by cornish and celtic political groups as one of six celtic nations alongside brittany ireland the isle of man scotland and wales 100 101 102 103 the isle of man government and the welsh government also recognise asturias and galicia 104 105 cornwall is represented as one of the celtic nations at the festival interceltique de lorient an annual celebration of celtic culture held in brittany 106 cornwall council consider cornwall s unique cultural heritage and distinctiveness to be one of the area s major assets they see cornwall s language landscape celtic identity political history patterns of settlement maritime tradition industrial heritage and non-conformist tradition to be among the features making up its distinctive culture 107 however it is uncertain how many of the people living in cornwall consider themselves to be cornish results from different surveys including the national census have varied in the 2001 census 7 per cent of people in cornwall identified themselves as cornish rather than british or english however activists have argued that this underestimated the true number as there was no explicit cornish option included in the official census form 108 subsequent surveys have suggested that as many as 44 per cent identify as cornish 109 many people in cornwall say that this issue would be resolved if a cornish option became available on the census 110 the question and content recommendations for the 2011 census provided an explanation of the process of selecting an ethnic identity which is relevant to the understanding of the often quoted figure of 37,000 who claim cornish identity 111 on 24 april 2014 it was announced that cornish people have been granted minority status under the european framework convention for the protection of national minorities 10 local politics cornwall council s headquarters in truro from the 2010 general election

courts of justice in truro magistrates courts are found in truro but at a different location to the crown court and at bodmin the isles of scilly form part of the ceremonial county of cornwall 112 and

other administrative purposes such as the national health service and devon and cornwall police 113 114 115 before reorganisation on 1 april 2009 council functions throughout the rest of cornwall were organised on a two-tier basis with a county council and district councils for its six districts caradon carrick kerrier north cornwall penwith and restormel while projected to streamline services cut red tape and save around 17 million a year the reorganisation was met with wide opposition with a poll in 2008 giving a result of 89 disapproval from cornish residents 116 117 118 the first elections for the unitary authority were held on 4 june 2009 the council has 123 seats the largest party in 2017 is the tory party with 46 seats the liberal democrats are the second largest party with 37 seats with the independents in third place with 30 119 before the creation of the unitary council the former county council had 82 seats the majority of which were held by the liberal democrats elected at the 2005 county council elections the six former districts had a total of 249 council seats and the groups with greatest numbers of councillors were liberal democrats conservatives and independents parliament and national politics following a review by the boundary commission for england taking effect at the 2010 general election cornwall is divided into six county constituencies to elect mps to the house of commons of the united kingdom before the 2010 boundary changes cornwall had five constituencies all of which were won by liberal democrats in the 2005 general election at the 2010 general election liberal democrat candidates won three constituencies and conservative candidates won three constituencies see also 2010 united kingdom general election result in cornwall at the 2015 general election all six cornish seats were won by conservative candidates all these conservative mps retained their seats in the 2017 general election until 1832 cornwall had 44 mps more than any other county reflecting the importance of tin to the crown 120 most of the increase in numbers of mps came between 1529 and 1584 after which there was no change until 1832 121 devolution movement cornish nationalists have organised into two political parties mebyon kernow formed in 1951 and the cornish nationalist party in addition to the political parties there are various interest groups such as the revived cornish stannary parliament and the celtic league the cornish constitutional convention was formed in 2000 as a cross-party organisation including representatives from the private public and voluntary sectors to campaign for the creation of a cornish assembly 8 122 along the lines of the national assembly for wales northern ireland assembly and the scottish parliament between 5 march 2000 and december 2001 the campaign collected the signatures of 41,650 cornish residents endorsing the call for a devolved assembly along with 8,896 signatories from outside cornwall the resulting petition was presented to the prime minister tony blair 8 the liberal democrats recognise cornwall s claims for greater autonomy as do the liberal party the new single council is also the opportunity to gain more control over local issues from regional and national government bureaucrats the first step on our way to a cornish assembly the liberal democrat manifesto for 2009 an additional political issue is the recognition of the cornish people as a minority 123 economy falmouth docks is the major port of cornwall and one of the largest natural harbours in the world the eden project near st austell cornwall s largest tourist attraction in terms of visitor numbers cornwall is one of the poorest parts of the united kingdom in terms of per capita gdp and average household incomes at the same time parts of the county especially on the coast have high house prices driven up by demand from relatively wealthy retired people and second-home owners 124 the gva per head was 65 of the uk average for 2004 125 the gdp per head for cornwall and the isles of scilly was 79.2 of the eu-27 average for 2004 the uk per head average was 123.0 126 in 2011 the latest available figures cornwall s including the isles of scilly measure of wealth was 64 of the european average per capita 127 historically mining of tin and later also of copper was important in the cornish economy the first reference to this appears to be by pytheas see above julius caesar was the last classical writer to mention the tin trade which appears to have declined during the roman occupation 128 the tin trade revived in the middle ages and its importance to the kings of england resulted in certain privileges being granted to the tinners the cornish rebellion of 1497 is attributed to grievances of the tin miners 129 in the mid-19th century however the tin trade again fell into decline other primary industries that have declined since the 1960s include china clay production fishing and farming today the cornish economy depends heavily on its tourist industry which makes up around a quarter of the economy the official measures of deprivation and poverty at district and sub-ward level show that there is great variation in poverty and prosperity in cornwall with some areas among the poorest in england and others among the top half in prosperity for example the ranking of 32,482 sub-wards in england in the index of multiple deprivation 2006 ranged from 819th part of penzance east to 30,899th part of saltash burraton in caradon where the lower number represents the greater deprivation 130 131 cornwall is one of two uk areas designated as less developed regions which qualify for cohesion policy grants from the european union 132 it was granted objective 1 status by the european commission for 2000 to

major financial success drawing one in eight of cornwall s visitors in 2004 139 internet cornwall is the landing point for twenty-two of the world s fastest high-speed undersea and transatlantic fibre optic cables making cornwall an important hub within europe s internet infrastructure 140 the superfast cornwall project completed in 2015 141 and saw 95 of cornish houses and businesses connected to

re-structured by eu fishing policies the southwest handline fishermen s association has started to revive the fishing industry 143 agriculture agriculture once an important part of the cornish economy has declined significantly however there is still a strong dairy industry producing products such as cornish clotted cream mining mining of tin and copper was also an industry but today the derelict mine workings survive only as a world heritage site 144 however the camborne school of mines which was relocated to penryn in 2004 is still a world centre of excellence in the field of mining and applied geology 145 and the grant of world heritage status has attracted funding for conservation and heritage tourism 146 china clay extraction has also been an important industry in the st austell area but this sector has been in decline and this coupled with increased mechanisation has led to a decrease in employment in this sector although the industry still employs around 2,133 people in cornwall and generates over 80 million to the local economy 147 aerospace the county s newest industry is aviation cornwall airport newquay is the only national and international airport west of exeter and is the home of a growing business park with enterprise zone status known as aerohub there are also plans to establish spaceport cornwall at newquay in partnership with goonhilly satellite

level of population growth at 11.2 in the 1980s and 5.3 in the 1990s it had the fifth-highest population growth rate of the counties of england 148 the natural change has been a small population decline and the population increase is due to inward migration into cornwall 149 according to the 1991 census the population was 469,800 cornwall has a relatively high retired population with 22.9 of pensionable age compared with 20.3 for the united kingdom as a whole 150 this may be due to a combination of cornwall s rural and coastal geography increasing its popularity as a retirement location
