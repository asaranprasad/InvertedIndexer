https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust oceanic crust from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search colors indicate the age of oceanic crust wherein red indicates the youngest age and blue indicates the oldest age the lines represent tectonic plate boundaries oceanic crust is the uppermost layer of the oceanic portion of a tectonic plate it is composed of the upper oceanic crust with pillow lavas and a dike complex and the lower oceanic crust composed of troctolite and gabbro 1 the crust overlies the solidified and uppermost layer of the mantle the crust and the solid mantle layer together constitute oceanic lithosphere oceanic crust is primarily composed of mafic rocks or sima which is rich in iron and magnesium it is thinner than continental crust or sial generally less than 10 kilometers thick however it is denser having a mean density of about 2.9 grams per cubic centimeter 2 as opposed to continental crust which has a density of about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter 3 the crust is the result of erupted mantle material originating from below the plate cooled and in most instances modified chemically by seawater 4 these eruptions occur mostly at mid-ocean ridges but also at scattered hotspots and also in rare but powerful occurrences known as flood basalt eruptions contents 1 composition 1.1 geochemistry 1.2 life cycle 2 magnetic anomalies 3 see also 4 notes 5 references composition edit although a complete section of oceanic crust has not yet been drilled geologists have several pieces of evidence that help them understand the ocean floor estimations of composition are based on analyses of ophiolites sections of oceanic crust that are thrust onto and preserved on the continents comparisons of the seismic structure of the oceanic crust with laboratory determinations of seismic velocities in known rock types and samples recovered from the ocean floor by submersibles dredging especially from ridge crests and fracture zones and drilling 5 oceanic crust is significantly simpler than continental crust and generally can be divided in three layers according to mineral physics experiments at lower mantle pressures oceanic crust becomes denser than the surrounding mantle 6 layer 1 is on an average 0.4 km thick it consists of unconsolidated or semiconsolidated sediments usually thin or even not present near the mid-ocean ridges but thickens farther away from the ridge 7 near the continental margins sediment is terrigenous meaning derived from the land unlike deep sea sediments which are made of tiny shells of marine organisms usually calcareous and siliceous or it can be made of volcanic ash and terrigenous sediments transported by turbidity currents 8 layer 2 could be divided into two parts layer 2a 0.5 km thick uppermost volcanic layer of glassy to finely crystalline basalt usually in the form of pillow basalt and layer 2b 1.5 km thick layer composed of diabase dikes 9 layer 3 is formed by slow cooling of magma beneath the surface and consists of coarse grained gabbros and cumulate ultramafic rocks it constitutes over two-thirds of oceanic crust volume with almost 5 km thickness 10 geochemistry edit the most voluminous volcanic rocks of the ocean floor are the mid-oceanic ridge basalts which are derived from low-potassium tholeiitic magmas these rocks have low concentrations of large ion lithophile elements lile light rare earth elements lree volatile elements and other highly incompatible elements there can be found basalts enriched with incompatible elements but they are rare and associated with mid-ocean ridge hot spots such as surroundings of galapagos islands the azores and iceland 11 life cycle edit oceanic crust is continuously being created at mid-ocean ridges as plates diverge at these ridges magma rises into the upper mantle and crust as it moves away from the ridge the lithosphere becomes cooler and denser and sediment gradually builds on top of it the youngest oceanic lithosphere is at the oceanic ridges and it gets progressively older away from the ridges 12 as the mantle rises it cools and melts as the pressure decreases and it crosses the solidus the amount of melt produced depends only on the temperature of the mantle as it rises hence most oceanic crust is the same thickness 7 1 km very slow spreading ridges 1 cm yr 1 half-rate produce thinner crust 4 5 km thick as the mantle has a chance to cool on upwelling and so it crosses the solidus and melts at lesser depth thereby producing less melt and thinner crust an example of this is the gakkel ridge under the arctic ocean thicker than average crust is found above plumes as the mantle is hotter and hence it crosses the solidus and melts at a greater depth creating more melt and a thicker crust an example of this is iceland which has crust of thickness 20 km 13 the age of the oceanic crust can be used to estimate the thermal thickness of the lithosphere where young oceanic crust has not had enough time to cool the mantle beneath it while older oceanic crust has thicker mantle lithosphere beneath it 14 the oceanic lithosphere subducts at what are known as convergent boundaries these boundaries can exist between oceanic lithosphere on one plate and oceanic lithosphere on another or between oceanic lithosphere on one plate and continental lithosphere on another in the second situation the oceanic lithosphere always subducts because the continental lithosphere is less dense the subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old 15 the process of super-continent formation and destruction via repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the wilson cycle the oldest large scale oceanic crust is in the west pacific and north-west atlantic - both are about up to 180-200 million years old however parts of the eastern mediterranean sea are remnants of the much older tethys ocean at about 270 and up to 340 million years old 16 17 18 magnetic anomalies edit the oceanic crust displays a pattern of magnetic lines parallel to the ocean ridges frozen in the basalt a symmetrical pattern of positive and negative magnetic lines emanates from the mid-ocean ridge 19 new rock is formed by magma at the mid-ocean ridges and the ocean floor spreads out from this point when the magma cools to form rock its magnetic polarity is aligned with the then-current positions of the magnetic poles of the earth new magma then forces the older cooled magma away from the ridge this process results in parallel sections of oceanic crust of alternating magnetic polarity see also edit mohorovi i discontinuity plate tectonics notes edit gillis et al 2014 primitive layered
