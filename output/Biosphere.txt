september 2001 to august 2017 provided by the seawifs project nasa goddard space flight center and orbimage citation needed the biosphere from greek b os life and sphaira sphere also known as the ecosphere from greek o kos environment and is the worldwide sum of all ecosystems it can also be termed as the zone of life on earth a closed system apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the earth and largely self-regulating 1 by the most general biophysiological definition the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere the biosphere is postulated to have evolved beginning with a process of biopoiesis life created naturally from non-living matter such as simple organic compounds or biogenesis life created from living matter at least some 3.5 billion years ago 2 3 in a general sense biospheres are any closed self-regulating systems containing ecosystems this includes artificial biospheres such as biosphere 2 and bios-3 and potentially ones on other planets or moons 4 contents 1 origin and use

links origin and use of the term edit a beach scene on earth simultaneously showing the lithosphere ground hydrosphere ocean and atmosphere air the term biosphere was coined by geologist eduard suess in 1875 which he defined as the place on earth s surface where life dwells 5 while the concept has a geological origin it is an indication of the effect of both charles darwin and matthew f maury on the earth sciences the biosphere s ecological context comes from the 1920s see vladimir i vernadsky preceding the 1935 introduction of the term ecosystem by sir arthur tansley see ecology history vernadsky defined ecology as the science of the biosphere it is an interdisciplinary concept for integrating astronomy geophysics meteorology biogeography evolution geology geochemistry hydrology and generally speaking all life and earth sciences narrow definition edit geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms the biomass or biota as referred to by biologists and ecologists in this sense the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model the other three being geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere when these four component spheres are combined into one system it is known as the ecosphere this term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet 6 the second international conference on closed life systems defined biospherics as the science and technology of analogs and models of earth s biosphere i e artificial earth-like biospheres 7 others may include the creation of artificial non-earth biospheres for example human-centered biospheres or a native martian biosphere as part of the topic of biospherics citation needed earth s biosphere edit age edit stromatolite fossil estimated at 3.2 3.6 billion years old the earliest evidence for life on earth includes biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks from western greenland 8 and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from western australia 9 10 more recently in 2015 remains of biotic life were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia 11 12 in 2017 putative fossilized microorganisms or microfossils were announced to have been discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the nuvvuagittuq belt of quebec canada that were as old as 4.28 billion years the oldest record of life on earth suggesting an almost instantaneous emergence of life after ocean formation 4.4 billion years ago and not long after the formation of the earth 4.54 billion years ago 13 14 15 16 according to biologist stephen blair hedges if life arose relatively quickly on earth then it could be common in the universe 11 extent edit r ppell s vulture xenophyophore a barophilic organism from the galapagos rift every part of the planet from the polar ice caps to the equator features life of some kind recent advances in microbiology have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the earth s terrestrial surface and that the total mass of microbial life in so-called uninhabitable zones may in biomass exceed all animal and plant life on the surface the actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure birds typically fly at altitudes as high as 1,800 m 5,900 ft 1.1 mi and fish live as much as 8,372 m 27,467 ft 5.202 mi underwater in the puerto rico trench 2 there are more extreme examples for life on the planet r ppell s vulture has been found at altitudes of 11,300 m 37,100 ft 7.0 mi bar-headed geese migrate at altitudes of at least 8,300 m 27,200 ft 5.2 mi yaks live at elevations as high as 5,400 m 17,700 ft 3.4 mi above sea level mountain goats live up to 3,050 m 10,010 ft 1.90 mi herbivorous animals at these elevations depend on lichens grasses and herbs life forms live in every part of the earth s biosphere including soil hot springs inside rocks at least 19 km 12 mi deep underground the deepest parts of the ocean and at least 64 km 40 mi high in the atmosphere 17 18 19 microorganisms under certain test conditions have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space 20 21 the total amount of soil and subsurface bacterial carbon is estimated as 5 1017 g or the weight of the united kingdom 17 the mass of prokaryote microorganisms which includes bacteria and archaea but not the nucleated eukaryote microorganisms may be as much as 0.8 trillion tons of carbon of the total biosphere mass estimated at between 1 and 4 trillion tons 22 barophilic marine microbes have been found at more than a depth of 10,000 m 33,000 ft 6.2 mi in the mariana trench the deepest spot in the earth s oceans 23 in fact single-celled life forms have been found in the deepest part of the mariana trench by the challenger deep at depths of 11,034 m 36,201 ft 6.856 mi 24 25 26 other researchers reported related studies that microorganisms thrive inside rocks up to 580 m 1,900 ft 0.36 mi below the sea floor under 2,590 m 8,500 ft 1.61 mi of ocean off the coast of the northwestern united states 25 27 as well as 2,400 m 7,900 ft 1.5 mi beneath the seabed off japan 28 culturable thermophilic microbes have been extracted from cores drilled more than 5,000 m 16,000 ft 3.1 mi into the earth s crust in sweden 29 from rocks between 65 75 c 149 167 f temperature increases with increasing depth into the earth s crust the rate at which the temperature increases depends on many factors including type of crust continental vs oceanic rock type geographic location etc the greatest known temperature at which microbial life can exist is 122 c 252 f methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 and it is likely that the limit of life in the deep biosphere is defined by temperature rather than absolute depth citation needed on 20 august 2014 scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living 800 m 2,600 ft 0.50 mi below the ice of antarctica 30 31 according to one researcher you can find microbes everywhere they re extremely adaptable to conditions and survive wherever they are 25 our biosphere is divided into a number of biomes inhabited by fairly similar flora and fauna on land biomes are separated primarily by latitude terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic and antarctic circles are relatively barren of plant and animal life while most of the more populous biomes lie near the equator annual variation edit on land vegetation appears on a scale from brown low vegetation to dark green lots of vegetation at the ocean surface phytoplankton are indicated on a scale from purple low to yellow high this visualization was created with data from satellites including seawifs and instruments including the nasa noaa visible infrared imaging radiometer suite and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer artificial biospheres edit biosphere 2 in arizona experimental biospheres also called closed ecological systems have been created to study ecosystems and the

biospheres remains hypothetical the rare earth hypothesis suggests they should be very rare save ones composed of microbial life only 35 on the other hand earth analogs may be quite numerous at least in the milky way galaxy given the large number of planets 36 three of the planets discovered orbiting trappist-1 could possibly contain biospheres 37 given limited understanding of abiogenesis it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres it is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created during the future for example on mars 38 the process of creating an uncontained system that mimics the function of earth s biosphere is called terraforming 39 see also edit cryosphere habitable zone homeostasis life support system man and the biosphere
