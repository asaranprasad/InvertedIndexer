arita constitutes a landform a landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the earth or other planetary body landforms together make up a given terrain and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography typical landforms include hills mountains plateaus canyons and valleys as well as shoreline features such as bays peninsulas and seas citation needed including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges volcanoes and the great ocean basins contents 1 physical characteristics 2 hierarchy of classes 3 recent developments 4 see also 5 references 6 external links physical characteristics edit landforms are categorized by characteristic physical attributes such as elevation slope orientation stratification rock exposure and soil type gross physical features or landforms include intuitive elements such as berms mounds hills ridges cliffs valleys rivers peninsulas volcanoes and numerous other structural and size-scaled i e ponds vs lakes hills vs mountains elements including various kinds of inland and oceanic waterbodies and sub-surface features this panorama in great smoky mountains national park has the readily identifiable physical features of a rolling plain actually part of a broad valley distant foothills and a backdrop of the old much weathered appalachian mountain range hierarchy of classes edit karst towers landforms along lijiang river guilin china oceans and continents exemplify the highest-order landforms landform elements are parts of a high-order landforms that can be further identified and systematically given a cohesive definition such as hill-tops shoulders saddles foreslopes and backslopes some generic landform elements including pits peaks channels ridges passes pools and plains terrain or relief is the third or vertical dimension of land surface topography is the study of terrain although the word is often used as a synonym for relief itself when relief is described underwater the term bathymetry is used in cartography many different techniques are used to describe relief including contour lines and tin triangulated irregular network elementary landforms segments facets relief units are the smallest homogeneous divisions of the land surface at the given scale resolution these are areas with relatively homogeneous morphometric properties bounded by lines of discontinuity a plateau or a hill can be observed at various scales ranging from few hundred meters to hundreds of kilometers hence the spatial distribution of landforms is often scale-dependent as is the case for soils and geological strata a number of factors ranging from plate tectonics to erosion and deposition can generate and affect landforms biological factors can also influence landforms for example note the role of vegetation in the development of dune systems and salt marshes and the work of corals and algae in the formation of coral reefs landforms do not include man-made features such as canals ports and many harbors and geographic features such as deserts forests and grasslands many of the terms are not restricted to refer to features of the planet earth and can be used to describe surface features of other planets and similar objects in the universe examples are mountains hills polar caps and valleys which are found on all of the terrestrial planets the scientific study of landforms is known as geomorphology recent developments edit landforms may be extracted from a digital elevation model using some automated techniques where the data has been gathered by modern satellites and stereoscopic aerial surveillance cameras 1 until recently compiling the data found in such data sets required time consuming and expensive techniques involving many man-hours the most detailed dems available are measured directly using lidar techniques see also edit geomorphology land list of landforms open-geomorphometry project terrain references edit robert a macmillan david h mcnabb r keith jones september 2000
