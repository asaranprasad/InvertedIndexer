karim studied computer science together at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign 7 according to a story that has often been repeated in the media hurley and chen developed the idea for youtube during the early months of 2005 after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at chen s apartment in san francisco karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred but chen commented that the idea that youtube was founded after a dinner party was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible 8 karim said the inspiration for youtube first came from janet jackson s role in the 2004 super bowl incident when her breast was exposed during her performance and later from the 2004 indian ocean tsunami karim could not easily find video clips of either event online which led to the idea of a video sharing site 9 hurley and chen said that the original idea for youtube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website hot or not 8 10 the youtube logo from launch until 2011 featuring its former slogan broadcast yourself youtube began as a

system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright google ceo eric schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from viacom which alleged that youtube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute 318 the system which became known as content id 319 creates an id file for copyrighted audio and video material and stores it in a database when a video is uploaded it is checked against the database and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found 320 when this occurs the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable tracking the viewing statistics of the video or adding advertisements to the video youtube describes content id as very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective id file 320 content id accounts for over a third of the monetized views on youtube 321 an independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to youtube and concluded that while the system was surprisingly resilient in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos it was not infallible 322 the use of content id to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use 323 if a youtube user disagrees with a decision by content id it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision 324 prior to 2016 videos weren t monetized until the dispute was resolved since april 2016

unlimited length 327 controversial content youtube has also faced criticism over the handling of offensive content in some of its videos the uploading of videos containing defamation pornography and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by youtube s community guidelines 297 youtube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate and a youtube employee will view a

fans from liverpool were crushed to death in 1989 328 329 in july 2008 the culture and media committee of the house of commons of the united kingdom stated that it was unimpressed with youtube s system for policing its videos and argued that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content youtube responded by stating we have strict rules on what s allowed and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24 7 review team and have it dealt with promptly we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly 330 july 2008 in october 2010 u s congressman anthony weiner urged youtube to remove from its website videos of imam anwar al-awlaki 331 youtube pulled some of the videos in november 2010 stating they violated the site s guidelines 332 in december 2010 youtube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism

violence language sexual content and controversial or sensitive subjects and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and tragedies even if graphic imagery is not shown unless the content is usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator s intent is to inform or entertain 335 in september 2016 after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations youtube s policies were criticized by prominent users including phillip defranco and vlogbrothers defranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was censorship by a different name a youtube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new the service had improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators 336 337 338 in march 2017 the government of the united kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from youtube after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremism content the

advertising on youtube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content google stated that it had begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear 339 340 in early-april 2017 the youtube channel h3h3productions presented evidence claiming that a wall street journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing johnny rebel music overlaid on a chief keef music video citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader the video was retracted after it was found that the ads had actually been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video 341 342 on april 6 2017 youtube announced that in order to ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review and have at least 10,000 lifetime views before they may join the partner program 343 child protection in 2017 youtube was associated with several controversies related to child safety during q2 the owners of popular channel daddyofive which featured themselves playing pranks on their children were accused of child abuse their videos were eventually deleted and two of their children were removed from their custody 344 345 346 347 later that year youtube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent sexual or otherwise disturbing situations many of which appeared on youtube kids and attracted millions of views the term elsagate was coined on the internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy 348 349 350 351 on november 11 2017 youtube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content later that month the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family friendly characters as part as a broader concern regarding child safety on youtube the wave of deletions also targeted channels which showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults most notably the company removed toy freaks a channel with over 8.5 million subscribers that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations 352 353 354 355 356 357 according to analytics specialist socialblade it earned up to 8.7 million annually prior to its deletion 358 also in november 2017 it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children often uploaded by the minors themselves and showing innocent content were attracting comments from pedophiles 359 360 and circulating on the dark web with predators finding the videos by typing in certain keywords in russian 360 as a result of the controversy which added to the concern about elsagate several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on youtube 361 351 user comments most videos enable users to leave comments and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content in 2006 time praised web 2.0 for enabling community and collaboration on a scale never seen before and added that youtube harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom some of the comments on youtube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred 362 the guardian in 2009 described users comments on youtube as 363 juvenile aggressive misspelled sexist homophobic swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a lol youtube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance with the occasional burst of wit shining through in september 2008 the daily telegraph commented that youtube was notorious for some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet and reported on youtube comment snob a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts 364 the huffington post noted in april 2012 that finding comments on youtube that appear offensive stupid and crass to the vast majority of the people is hardly difficult 365 on november 6 2013 google implemented a comment system oriented on google that required all youtube users to use a google account in order to comment on videos the stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone 366 the new system restored the ability to include urls in comments which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse 367 368 in response youtube co-founder jawed karim posted the question why the fuck do i need a google account to comment on a video on his youtube channel to express his negative opinion of the change 369 the official youtube announcement 370 received 20,097 thumbs down votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days 371 writing in the newsday blog silicon island chase melvin noted that google is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook but it s essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who don t want to lose their ability to comment on videos and discussion forums across the internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system in the same article melvin goes on to say 372 perhaps user complaints are justified but the idea of revamping the old system isn t so bad think of the crude misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on youtube without any discernible moderation isn t any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot the system is far from perfect but google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate youtubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity on july 27 2015 google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a google account to post comments to youtube 373 on november 3 2016 youtube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments 374 creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam they can also allow other users to moderate their comments 375 view counts in december 2012 two billion views were removed from the view counts of universal and sony music videos on youtube prompting a claim by the daily dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site s terms of service which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts this was disputed by billboard which said that the two billion views had been moved to vevo since the videos were no longer active on youtube 376 377 on august 5 2015 youtube removed the feature which caused a video s view count to freeze at 301 later 301 until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud 378 youtube view counts once again updated in real time 379 censorship and filtering as of 2017 countries with standing national bans on youtube are china and north korea while iran blocks youtube on only one internet service provider youtube may be blocked for a variety of reasons including 380 limiting public exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest preventing criticism of a ruler e g in north korea government e g in china or its actions e g in morocco government officials e g in turkey and libya or religion e g in pakistan violations of national laws including copyright and intellectual property protection laws for example in germany violations of hate speech ethics or morality-based laws e g in iran and preventing access to videos judged to be inappropriate for youth 381 which is also done by youtube with the youtube kids app and with restricted mode 382 reducing distractions at work or school 383 e g in australia and reducing the amount of network bandwidth used 384 385 386 in some countries youtube is completely blocked either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest the run-up to an election or in response to upcoming political anniversaries in other countries access to the website as a whole remains open but access to specific videos is blocked in cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video youtube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service businesses schools government agencies and other private institutions often block social media sites including youtube due to bandwidth limitations and the site s potential for distraction 380 several countries have previously blocked access to youtube iran temporarily blocked access on december 3 2006 to youtube and several other sites after declaring them as violating social and moral codes of conduct the youtube block came after a video was posted online that appeared to show an iranian soap opera star having sex 387 the block was later lifted and then reinstated after iran s 2009 presidential election 388 in 2012 iran reblocked access along with access to google after the controversial film innocence of muslims trailer was released on youtube 389 thailand blocked access between 2006 and 2007 due to offensive videos relating to king bhumibol adulyadej 390 391 some australian state education departments block youtube citing an inability to determine what sort of video material might be accessed and there s no educational value to it and the content of the material on the site 392 china blocked access from october 15 2007 to march 22 2008 and again starting on march 24 2009 access remains blocked 393 394 395 396 morocco blocked access in may 2007 possibly as a result of videos critical of morocco s actions in western sahara 397 youtube became accessible again on may 30 2007 after maroc telecom unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere technical glitch 398 turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to mustafa kemal atat rk 399 400 401 in november 2010 a video of the turkish politician deniz baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video 402 during the two and a half-year block of youtube the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in turkey 403 404 in 2014 turkey blocked the access for the second time after a high-level intelligence leak 405 406 407 pakistan blocked access on february 23 2008 because of offensive material towards the islamic faith including display of the danish cartoons of muhammad 408 this led to a near global blackout of the youtube site for around two hours as the pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries on february 26 2008 the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government 409 410 many pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software 411 in may 2010 following the everybody draw mohammed day pakistan again blocked access to youtube citing growing sacrilegious content 412 the ban was lifted on may 27 2010 after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government however individual videos deemed offensive to muslims posted on youtube will continue to be blocked 413 414 pakistan again placed a ban on youtube in september 2012 after the site refused to remove the film innocence of muslims with the ban still in operation as of september 2013 415 the ban was lifted in january 2016 after youtube launched a pakistan-specific version 416 turkmenistan blocked access on december 25 2009 for unknown reasons other websites such as livejournal were also blocked 417 libya blocked access on january 24 2010 because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in abu salim prison in 1996 and videos of family members of libyan leader muammar gaddafi at parties the blocking was criticized by human rights watch 418 in november 2011 after the libyan civil war youtube was once again allowed in libya 419 afghanistan bangladesh russia and sudan blocked access in september 2012 following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film innocence of muslims which had been posted on the site 420 421 422 423 424 425 in libya and egypt the innocence of muslims trailer was blamed by whom for violent protests in september 2012 youtube stated that this video which is widely available on the web is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on youtube however given the very difficult situation in libya and egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries 426 427 see also
