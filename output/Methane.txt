methane us m e n or uk mi e n is a chemical compound with the chemical formula ch4 one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen it is a group-14 hydride and the simplest alkane and is the main constituent of natural gas the relative abundance of methane on earth makes it an attractive fuel though capturing and storing it poses challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure natural methane is found both below ground and under the sea floor when it reaches the surface and the atmosphere it is known as atmospheric methane 5 the earth s atmospheric

history edit this section needs expansion you can help by november 2013 in november 1776 methane was first scientifically identified by italian physicist alessandro volta in the marshes of lake maggiore straddling italy and switzerland volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by benjamin franklin about flammable air 7 volta collected the gas rising from the marsh and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas 8 he also demonstrated that the gas could be ignited with an electric spark 8 the name methane was coined in 1866 by the german chemist august wilhelm von hofmann 9 the name was derived from methanol properties and bonding edit methane is a tetrahedral molecule with four equivalent c h bonds its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals mos resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on c and h the lowest energy mo is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the in-phase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of mos that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen the resulting three-over-one bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements at room temperature and standard pressure methane is a colorless odorless gas 10 the familiar smell of natural gas as used in homes is achieved by the addition of an odorant usually blends containing tert-butylthiol as a safety measure methane has a boiling point of 161 c 257.8 f at a pressure of one atmosphere 11 as a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations 5.4 17 in air at standard pressure solid methane exists in several modifications presently nine are known 12 cooling methane at normal pressure results in the formation of methane i this substance crystallizes in the cubic system space group fm3m the positions of the hydrogen atoms are not fixed in methane i i e methane molecules may rotate freely therefore it is a plastic crystal 13 chemical reactions edit the primary chemical reactions of methane are combustion steam reforming to syngas and halogenation in general methane reactions are difficult to control partial oxidation to methanol for example is challenging because the reaction typically progresses all the way to carbon dioxide and water even with an insufficient supply of oxygen the enzyme methane monooxygenase produces methanol from methane but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions 14 acid-base reactions edit like other hydrocarbons methane is a very weak acid its pka in dmso is estimated to be 56 15 it cannot be deprotonated in solution but the conjugate base with methyllithium is known a variety of positive ions derived from methane have been observed mostly as unstable species in low-pressure gas mixtures these include methenium or methyl cation ch 3 methane cation ch 4 and methanium or protonated methane ch 5 some of these have been detected in outer space methanium can also be produced as diluted solutions from methane with superacids cations with higher charge such as ch2 6 and ch3 7 have been studied theoretically and conjectured to be stable 16 despite the strength of its c h bonds there is intense interest in catalysts that facilitate c h bond activation in methane and other lower numbered alkanes 17 combustion edit methane burns easily methane s heat of combustion is 55.5 mj kg 18 combustion of methane is a multiple step reaction the following equations are part of the process with the net result being ch 4 2 o 2 co 2 2 h 2o h 891 kj mol at standard conditions ch4 m ch3 h m ch4 o2 ch3 ho2 ch4 ho2 ch3 2 oh ch4 oh ch3 h2o o2 h o oh ch4 o ch3 oh ch3 o2 ch2o oh ch2o o cho oh ch2o oh cho h2o ch2o h cho h2 cho o co oh cho oh co h2o cho h co h2 h2 o h oh h2 oh h h2o co oh co2 h h oh m h2o m h h m h2 m h o2 m ho2 m the species m signifies an energetic third body from which energy is transferred during a molecular collision formaldehyde hcho or h 2co is an early intermediate reaction 7 oxidation of formaldehyde gives the formyl radical hco reactions 8 10 which then give carbon monoxide co reactions 11 12 13 any resulting h2 oxidizes to h2o or other intermediates reaction 14 15 finally the co oxidizes forming co2 reaction 16 in the final stages reactions 17 19 energy is transferred back to other third bodies the overall reaction rate is a function of the concentration of the various entities during the combustion process the higher the temperature the greater the concentration of radical species and the more rapid the combustion process 19 reactions with halogens edit given appropriate conditions methane reacts with halogens as follows x 2 uv 2 x x ch 4 hx ch 3 ch 3 x 2 ch 3x x where x is a halogen fluorine f chlorine cl bromine br or iodine i this mechanism for this process is called free radical halogenation it is initiated with uv light or some other radical initiator a chlorine atom is generated from elemental chlorine which abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane resulting in the formation of hydrogen chloride the resulting methyl radical ch3 can combine with another chlorine molecule to give methyl chloride ch3cl and a chlorine atom this chlorine atom can then react with another methane or methyl chloride molecule repeating the chlorination cycle 20 similar reactions can produce dichloromethane ch2cl2 chloroform chcl3 and ultimately carbon tetrachloride ccl4 depending upon reaction conditions and the chlorine to methane ratio uses edit methane is used in industrial chemical processes and may be transported as a refrigerated liquid liquefied natural gas or lng while leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air gas pipelines distribute large amounts of natural gas of which methane is the principal component fuel edit methane is used as a fuel for ovens homes water heaters kilns automobiles 21 22 turbines and other things it combusts with oxygen to create heat as demonstrated by a british inventor in a 1974 film of the national film board of canada 23 natural gas edit methane is important for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator compared to other hydrocarbon fuels methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released at about 891 kj mol methane s heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but the ratio of the heat of combustion 891 kj mol to the molecular mass 16.0 g mol of which 12.0 g mol is carbon shows that methane being the simplest hydrocarbon produces more heat per mass unit 55.7 kj g than other complex hydrocarbons in many cities methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking in this context it is usually known as natural gas which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter or 1,000 btu per standard cubic foot methane in the form of compressed natural gas is used as a vehicle fuel and is claimed to be more environmentally friendly than other fossil fuels such as gasoline petrol and diesel 22 research into adsorption methods of methane storage for use as an automotive fuel has been conducted 24 liquefied natural gas edit liquefied natural gas lng is natural gas predominantly methane ch4 that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport liquefied natural gas takes up about 1 600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state it is odorless colorless non-toxic and non-corrosive hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state freezing and asphyxia the liquefaction process involves removal of certain components such as dust acid gases helium water and heavy hydrocarbons which could cause difficulty downstream the natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure maximum transport pressure set at around 25 kpa or 3.6 psi by cooling it to approximately 162 c 260 f citation needed lng achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas cng so that the energy density of lng is 2.4 times greater than that of cng or 60 that of diesel fuel 25 this makes lng cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist specially designed cryogenic sea vessels lng carriers or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport lng when it is not highly refined for special uses is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas it is also beginning to be used in lng-fueled road vehicles for example trucks in commercial operation have been achieving payback periods of approximately four years on the higher initial investment required in lng equipment on the trucks and lng infrastructure to support fueling 26 however it remains more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas as of 2002 the relatively higher cost of lng production and the need to store lng in more expensive cryogenic tanks had slowed widespread commercial use 27 liquid methane rocket fuel edit in a highly refined form liquid methane is used as a rocket fuel 28 though methane has been investigated for decades no production methane engines have yet been used on orbital spaceflights 29 methane is reported to offer the advantage over kerosene of depositing less carbon on the internal parts of rocket motors reducing the difficulty of re-use of boosters since the 1990s a number of russian rockets using liquid methane have been proposed 30 31 one 1990s russian engine proposal was the rd-192 a methane lox variant of the rd-191 31 in 2005 us companies orbitec orbital technologies corporation now part of sierra nevada corporation as of 2014 and xcor aerospace developed a demonstration liquid oxygen liquid methane rocket engine and a larger 7,500 pounds-force 33 kn -thrust engine in 2007 for potential use as the cev lunar return engine before the cev program was later cancelled 32 33 34 more recently the american private space company spacex announced in 2012 an initiative to develop liquid methane rocket engines 35 including initially the very large raptor rocket engine 36 raptor is being designed to produce 1,900 kn 430,000 lbf of thrust with a vacuum specific impulse isp of 375 seconds and a sea-level isp of 330 seconds 37 and began component-level testing in 2014 38 in february 2014 the raptor engine design was shown to be of the highly efficient and theoretically more reliable full-flow staged combustion cycle type where both propellant streams oxidizer and fuel are completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber prior to 2014 only two full-flow rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands but neither engine completed development or flew on a flight vehicle 39 in 2016 a development raptor engine was tested 40 in october 2013 the china aerospace science and technology corporation a state-owned contractor for the chinese space program announced that it had completed a first ignition test on a new lox methane rocket engine no engine size was provided 41 in september 2014 another american private space company blue origin publicly announced that they were into their third year of development work on a large methane rocket engine the new engine the blue engine 4 or be-4 has been designed to produce 2,400 kilonewtons 550,000 lbf of thrust while initially planned to be used exclusively on a blue origin proprietary launch vehicle it will now be used on a new united launch alliance ula engine on a new launch vehicle that is a successor to the atlas v ula indicated in 2014 that they will make the maiden flight of the new launch vehicle no earlier than 2019 42 one advantage of methane is that it is abundant in many parts of the solar system and it could potentially be harvested on the surface of another solar-system body in particular using methane production from local materials found on mars 43 or titan providing fuel for a return journey 28 44 by 2013 nasa s project morpheus had developed a small restartable lox methane rocket engine with 5,000 pounds-force 22 kn thrust and a specific impulse of 321 seconds suitable for inspace applications including landers small lox methane thrusters 5 15 pounds-force 22 67 n were also developed suitable for use in a reaction control system rcs 45 46 spacenews is reporting in early 2015 that the french space agency cnes is working with germany and a few other governments and will propose a lox methane engine on a reusable launch vehicle by mid-2015 needs update with flight testing unlikely before approximately 2026 47 chemical feedstock edit although there is great interest in converting methane into useful or more easily liquefied compounds the only practical processes are relatively unselective in the chemical industry methane is converted to synthesis gas a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen by steam reforming this endergonic process requiring energy utilizes nickel catalysts and requires high temperatures around 700 1100 c ch 4 h 2o co 3 h 2 related chemistries are exploited in the haber-bosch synthesis of ammonia from air which is reduced with natural gas to a mixture of carbon dioxide water and ammonia methane is also subjected to free-radical chlorination in the production of chloromethanes although methanol is a more typical precursor 48 other commercially viable processes that use methane as a chemical feedstock include the catalytic oxidation of methane into methanol 49 based on the oxidative coupling of methane and the direct reaction of methane with sulfur trioxide to produce methanesulfonic acid 50 51 generation edit geological routes edit there are two main routes for geological methane generation organic thermogenic and inorganic abiotic meaning non-living thermally generated methane is referred to as thermogenic originating from deeper sedimentary strata thermogenic methane ch4 formation occurs due to the break-up of organic matter forced by elevated temperatures and pressures this type of methane is considered to be the primary methane type in sedimentary basins and from an economical perspective the most important source of natural gas thermogenic methane components are generally considered to be relic from an earlier time generally formation of thermogenic methane at depth can occur through organic matter break-up or organic synthesis both ways can involve microorganisms methanogenesis but may also occur inorganically the involved anaerobic and aerobic processes can also consume methane with and without microorganisms the more important source of methane at depth crystalline bedrock is abiotic abiotic means that the methane formation took place involving inorganic compounds without biological activity magmatic or created at low temperatures and pressures through water-rock reactions 52 53 biological routes edit naturally occurring methane is mainly produced by microbial methanogenesis citation needed this multistep process is used by microorganisms as an energy source the net reaction is co 2 8 h 8 e ch 4 2 h 2o the final step in the process is catalyzed by the enzyme coenzyme-b sulfoethylthiotransferase methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic respiration used by organisms that occupy landfill ruminants e g cattle and the guts of termites it is uncertain whether plants are a source of methane emissions 54 55 56 industrial routes edit there are many technological methane production methods methane created from biomass in industrial plants via biological route is called biogas a more synthetic method to produce methane is hydrogenating carbon dioxide through the sabatier process methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the fischer tropsch process which is practiced on a large scale to produce longer-chain molecules than methane example of large-scale coal-to-methane gasification is the great plains synfuels plant started in 1984 in beulah north dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low-grade lignite a resource that is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight ash content low calorific value and propensity to spontaneous combustion during storage and transport methane as natural gas has been so abundant that synthetic production of it has been limited to special cases and as of 2016 covers only minor fraction of the methane used power to methane edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed february 2017 learn how and when to remove this template message power to methane is a technology that uses electrical power to produce hydrogen from water by electrolysis and uses the sabatier reaction to combine hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane as of 2016 this is mostly under development and not in large-scale use theoretically the process could be used as a buffer for excess and off-peak power generated by highly fluctuating wind generators and solar arrays the conversion efficiency of power to methane is 49 65 and full power methane power cycle is 30 38 laboratory synthesis edit methane can be produced by the destructive distillation of acetic acid in the presence of soda lime or similar acetic acid is decarboxylated in this process methane can be prepared from aluminium carbide by reaction with water or strong acids it is also made by reducing a solution of methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid with iron powder giving water and ferrous chloride as byproducts on mars edit methane has been proposed as a possible rocket propellant on future mars missions due in part to the possibility of synthesizing it on the planet by in situ resource utilization 57 an adaptation of the sabatier methanation reaction may be used with a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water-gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on mars utilizing water from the martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere 43 methane could also be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization a involving water carbon dioxide and the mineral olivine which is known to be common on mars 58 occurrence edit methane was discovered and isolated by alessandro volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from lake maggiore it is the major component of natural gas about 87 by volume the major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source see coal bed methane extraction a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams it is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen methane is produced at shallow levels low pressure by anaerobic decay of organic matter and reworked methane from deep under the earth s surface in general the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil methane is generally transported in bulk by pipeline in its natural gas form or lng carriers in its liquefied form few countries transport it by truck alternative sources edit testing australian sheep for exhaled methane production 2001 csiro apart from gas fields an alternative method of obtaining methane is via biogas generated by the fermentation of organic matter including manure wastewater sludge municipal solid waste including landfills or any other biodegradable feedstock under anaerobic conditions rice fields also generate large amounts of methane during plant growth methane hydrates clathrates ice-like combinations of methane and water on the sea floor found in vast quantities are a potential future source of methane cattle belch methane accounts for 16 of the world s annual methane emissions to the atmosphere 59 one study reported that the livestock sector in general primarily cattle chickens and pigs produces 37 of all human-induced methane 60 early research has found a number of medical treatments and dietary adjustments that help slightly limit the production of methane in ruminants 61 62 a 2009 study found that at a conservative estimate at least 51 of global greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to the life cycle and supply chain of livestock products meaning all meat dairy and by-products and their transportation 63 more recently a 2013 study estimated that livestock accounted for 44 percent of human-induced methane and 14.5 percent of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions 64 many efforts are underway to reduce livestock methane production and trap the gas to use as energy 65 paleoclimatology research published in current biology suggests that flatulence from dinosaurs may have warmed the earth 66 atmospheric methane edit methane concentrations up to december 2017 mauna loa methane is created near the earth s surface primarily by microorganisms by the process of methanogenesis it is carried into the stratosphere by rising air in the tropics uncontrolled build-up of methane in the atmosphere is naturally checked although human influence can upset this natural regulation by methane s reaction with hydroxyl radicals formed from singlet oxygen atoms and with water vapor it has a net lifetime of about 10 years 67 and is primarily removed by conversion to carbon dioxide and water in addition there is a large but unknown amount of methane in methane clathrates in the ocean floors as well as the earth s crust in 2010 methane levels in the arctic were measured at 1850 nmol mol a level over twice as high as at any time in the 400,000 years prior to the industrial revolution historically methane concentrations in the world s atmosphere have ranged between 300 and 400 nmol mol during glacial periods commonly known as ice ages and between 600 and 700 nmol mol during the warm interglacial periods recent research suggests that the earth s oceans are a potentially important new source of arctic methane 68 methane is an important greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 34 compared to co2 over a 100-year period and 72 over a 20-year period 69 70 the earth s atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150 since 1750 and it accounts for 20 of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases these gases don t include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect 6 clathrates edit methane is essentially insoluble in water but it can be trapped in ice forming a similar solid significant deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of earth at large depths estimates consider up to 15,000 gigatonnes of carbon may be stored in the form of clathrates hydrates in the ocean floor not accounting for abiotic methane a relatively newly discovered source of methane formed below the ocean floor in the earth crust 71 it has been suggested that today s methane emission regime from the ocean floor is potentially similar to that during the petm 72 arctic methane release from permafrost and methane clathrates is an expected consequence and further cause of global warming 73 74 75 anaerobic oxidation of methane edit there is a group of bacteria that drive methane oxidation with nitrite as the oxidant the anaerobic oxidation of methane 76 safety edit methane is nontoxic yet it is extremely flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air methane is violently reactive with oxidizers halogen and some halogen-containing compounds methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16 by displacement as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21 to 16 without ill effects the concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant is much higher than the 5 15 concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building methane gas explosions are responsible for many deadly mining disasters 77 a methane gas explosion was the cause of the upper big branch coal mine disaster in west virginia on april 5 2010 killing 29 78 extraterrestrial methane edit methane has been detected or is believed to exist on all planets of the solar system and most of the larger moons with the possible exception of mars it is believed to have come from abiotic processes mercury the tenuous atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane 79 venus the atmosphere contains a large amount of methane from 60 km 37 mi to the surface according to data collected by the pioneer venus large probe neutral mass spectrometer 80 moon traces are outgassed from the surface 81 methane ch 4 on mars potential sources and sinks mars the martian atmosphere contains 10 nmol mol methane 82 the source of methane on mars has not been determined recent research suggests that methane may come from volcanoes fault lines or methanogens 83 that it may be a byproduct of electrical discharges from dust devils and dust storms 84 or that it may be the result of uv radiation 85 in january 2009 nasa scientists announced that they had discovered that the planet often vents methane into the atmosphere in specific areas leading some to speculate this may be a sign of biological activity below the surface 86 studies of a weather research and forecasting model for mars marswrf and related mars general circulation model mgcm suggests that methane plume sources may be located within tens of kilometers which is within the roving capabilities of future mars rovers 87 methane measurements in mars atmosphere by the curiosity rover the curiosity rover which landed on mars in august 2012 can distinguish between different isotopologues of methane 88 but even if the mission determines that microscopic martian life is the source of the methane it probably resides far below the surface beyond the rover s reach 89 curiosity s sample analysis at mars sam instrument is capable of tracking the presence of methane over time to determine whether it is constant variable seasonal or random providing further clues about its source 90 the first measurements with the tunable laser spectrometer tls indicated that there is less than 5 ppb of methane at the landing site 91 92 93 94 the mars trace gas mission orbiter planned for launch in 2016 would further study mars methane 95 96 and its decomposition products such as formaldehyde and methanol alternatively these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means such as serpentinization 58 on july 19 2013 nasa scientists reported finding not much methane i e an upper limit of 2.7 parts per billion of methane around the gale crater where the curiosity rover landed in august 2012 97 98 99 on september 19 2013 from further measurements by curiosity nasa scientists reported no detection of atmospheric methane with a value of 6999180000000000000 0.18 0.67 ppbv corresponding to an upper limit of only 1.3 ppbv 95 confidence limit and as a result concluded that the probability of current methanogenic microbial activity on mars is reduced 100 101 102 on 16 december 2014 nasa reported the curiosity rover detected a tenfold spike likely localized in the amount of methane in the martian atmosphere sample measurements taken a dozen times over 20 months showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014 averaging 7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere before and after that readings averaged around one-tenth that level 103 104 jupiter the atmosphere contains 3000 1000 ppm methane 105 saturn the atmosphere contains 4500 2000 ppm methane 106 enceladus the atmosphere contains 1.7 methane 107 iapetus citation needed titan the atmosphere contains 1.6 methane and thousands of methane lakes have been detected on the surface 108 in the upper atmosphere methane is converted into more complex molecules including acetylene a process that also produces molecular hydrogen there is evidence that acetylene and hydrogen are recycled into methane near the surface this suggests the presence either of an exotic catalyst possibly an unknown form of methanogenic life 109 methane showers probably prompted by changing seasons have also been observed 110 on october 24 2014 methane was found in polar
