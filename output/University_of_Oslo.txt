template message early history edit king frederick vi of denmark and norway was the founder of the university in 1811 a decision was made to establish the first university in the dano-norwegian union after an agreement was reached with king frederik vi who had earlier believed that such an institution might encourage political separatist tendencies in 1813 the royal frederik s university was founded in christiania later renamed oslo a small city at that time circumstances then changed dramatically one year into the commencement clarification needed of the university as norway proclaimed independence however independence was somewhat restricted as norway was obliged to enter into a legislative union with sweden based on the outcome of the war of 1814 norway retained its own constitution and independent state institutions although royal power and foreign affairs were shared clarification needed with sweden at a time when norwegians feared political domination by the swedes the new university became a key institution that contributed to norwegian political and cultural independence the main initial function of the royal frederick university was to educate a new class of upper-echelon civil servants as well as parliamentary representatives and government ministers the university also became the centre for a survey of the country a survey of culture language history and folk traditions the staff of the university strove to undertake a wide range of tasks necessary for developing a modern society throughout the 1800s the university s academic disciplines gradually became more specialised one of the major changes in the university came during the 1870s when a greater emphasis was placed upon research the management of the university became more professional academic subjects were reformed and the forms of teaching evolved classical education came under increasing pressure clarification needed when the union with sweden was dissolved in 1905 the university became important for producing highly educated experts in a society which placed increasing emphasis on ensuring that all its citizens enjoy a life of dignity and security education health services and public administration were among those fields that recruited personnel from the university s graduates 1900 1945 edit research changed qualitatively around the turn of the century as new methods scientific theories and forms of practice changed the nature of research it was decided that teachers should arrive at their posts as highly qualified academics and continue academic research alongside their role as teachers scientific research whether to launch or test out new theories to innovate or to pave the way for discoveries across a wide range of disciplines became part of the increased expectations placed on the university developments in society created a need for more and more specialised and practical knowledge not merely competence in theology or law for example the university strove to meet these expectations through increasing academic specialisation the position of rector was established by parliament in 1905 following the dissolution of the union waldemar christofer br gger was professor of geology and became the university s first rector br gger vacillated between a certain pessimism and a powerfully energetic attitude regarding how to procure finances for research and fulfill his more general funding objectives with the establishment of the national research council after world war ii br gger s vision was largely fulfilled research received funding independent of teaching this coincided with a massive rise in student enrollment during the 1960s which again made it difficult to balance research with the demands for teaching in the years leading up to 1940 research was more strongly linked with the growth of the nation with progress and self-assertion research was also seen to contribute to norway s commitment to international academic and cultural development during the period after world war i research among norwegian researchers resulted in two nobel prizes the nobel prize in economics was awarded to ragnar frisch the nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to odd hassel in the field of linguistics several norwegian researchers distinguished themselves internationally increased research activity during the first half of the 1900s was part of an international development that also included norway student enrollment doubled between 1911 and 1940 and students were recruited from increasingly broad geographical gender and social bases the working class was still largely left behind however during the german occupation which lasted from 1940 1945 the university rector didrik arup seip was imprisoned the university was then placed under the management of adolf hoel a ns norwegian nazi party appointee a number of students participated in the norwegian resistance movement after fire was set in the university auditorium reich commissar terboven ordered the university closed and the students arrested a number of students and teachers were detained by the germans nearly until the end of the war 1945 2000 edit after wwii public authorities made loans available to students whose families were unable to provide financial assistance the state educational loan fund for young students was established in 1947 as a result the post-war years saw a record increase in student numbers many of these students had been unable to begin their studies or had seen their studies interrupted because of the war they could now enroll for the 1945 autumn semester 5951 students registered at the university this represented the highest student enrollment at uio up to that time in 1947 the number had risen to more than 6000 students this represented a 50 per cent increase in the number of students compared to the number enrolled prior to the war in no previous period had a single decade brought so many changes for the university as the 1960s the decade represented an unparalleled period of growth from 1960 to 1970 student enrollment tripled rising from 5,600 to 16,800 this tremendous influx would have been enough in itself to transform the way the university was perceived from both the inside and the outside as it turned out the changes were even more comprehensive the university campus at blindern was expanded and the number of academic and administrative employees rose the number of academic positions doubled from fewer than 500 to around 1,200 the increase in the number of students and staff transformed traditional forms of work and organisation the expansion of the blindern complex allowed the accommodation of 7,000 students the explosive rise in student numbers during the 1960s impacted the blindern campus in particular the faculties situated in central oslo law and medicine experienced only a doubling in student enrollment during the 1960s while the number of students in the humanities and social sciences tripled by 1968 revolutionary political ideas had taken root in earnest among university students the student uprising became a turning point in the history of universities throughout the western world often the outlook for students in the 1960s was bleak more than ever before came from non-academic backgrounds and had few role models the university of the masses was unable to lift all its students to the lofty elite positions enjoyed by previous generations of academics many students dissociated themselves therefore from the so-called establishment and the way the establishment functioned many were impatient and wanted to use their knowledge to change society it was thought that academics should stand in solidarity with the underprivileged the most fundamental change in the student population was the increasing proportion of women students throughout the 1970s the number of women increased until it made up the majority of students at the same time the university became a centre for the organised women s liberation movement which emerged in the 1970s up until the millennium the number of students enrolled at the university rose exponentially in 1992 uio implemented a restriction on admissions for all of its faculties for the first time a large part of the explanation for the high student numbers was thought to be found in the poor job market in 1996 there were 38,265 students enrolled at uio this level was approximately 75 per cent above the average during the 1970s and 1980s the strong rise in student numbers during the 1990s was attributed partially to the poor labour market hierarchy edit the highest position at the university is professor i e full professor in norway the title professor which is protected by law is only used for full professors prior to 1990 all professors were appointed for life to their chairs by the king-in-council i e by the king upon the advice of the cabinet the

qualifying positions such as stipendiat research fellow and postdoktor postdoctoral fellow a small number of employees with few or no teaching obligations hold the special research career pathway ranks researcher senior researcher and research professor which correspond to assistant professor associate professor and professor respectively several other less common academic positions also exist historically only professors had the right to vote and be represented in the governing bodies of the university originally all professors were automatically members of the collegium academicum the highest governing body of the university but soon afterwards its membership was limited docents were granted the right to vote and be represented in 1939 and other academics and students in 1955 in 1975 the technical-administrative support staff was also granted the right to vote and be represented in certain bodies as the last group formerly by law and now by tradition the highest positions such as rector or dean are only held by professors they are elected by the academic community academics and students and by the technical-administrative support staff but the votes of the academics carry significantly more weight faculties edit the university s research structure consists of eight schools or faculties they are the faculties of dentistry educational sciences humanities law
