increase in altitude or increases with the decrease in altitude 1 2 lapse rate arises from the word lapse in the sense of a gradual change although this concept is most often applied to earth s troposphere lapse rate can be extended to any gravitationally supported parcel of gas contents 1 definition 2 convection and adiabatic expansion 3 mathematics of the adiabatic lapse rate 3.1 dry

definition from the glossary of meteorology 3 is the decrease of an atmospheric variable with height the variable being temperature unless otherwise specified in general a lapse rate is the negative

temperature the temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between radiation and convection sunlight hits the ground and heats it the ground then heats the air at the surface if radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly 333 k 60 c 140 f and the temperature would decay exponentially with height 6 however when air is hot it tends to expand which lowers its density thus hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward this is the process of convection convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as the other air at the same elevation when a parcel of air expands it pushes on the air around it doing work thermodynamics since the parcel does work but gains no heat it loses internal energy so that its temperature decreases the process of expanding and contracting without exchanging heat is an adiabatic process the term adiabatic means that no heat transfer occurs into or out of the parcel air has low thermal conductivity and the bodies of air involved are very large so transfer of heat by conduction is negligibly small the adiabatic process for air has a characteristic temperature-pressure curve so the process determines the lapse rate when the air contains little water this lapse rate is known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate the rate of temperature decrease is 9.8 c km 5.38 f per 1,000 ft 3.0 c 1,000 ft the reverse occurs for a sinking parcel of air 7 note that only the troposphere up to approximately 12 kilometres 39,000 ft of altitude in the earth s atmosphere undergoes convection the stratosphere does not generally convect 8 however some exceptionally energetic convection processes -- notably volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops associated with severe supercell thunderstorms -- may locally and temporarily inject convection through the tropopause and into the stratosphere mathematics of the adiabatic lapse rate edit these calculation use a very simple model of an atmosphere either dry or moist within a still vertical column at equilibrium dry adiabatic

vaporization as a parcel of air rises and cools it eventually becomes saturated that is the vapor pressure of water in equilibrium with liquid water has decreased as temperature has decreased to the point where it is equal to the actual vapor pressure of water with further decrease in temperature the water vapor in excess of the equilibrium amount condenses forming cloud and releasing heat latent heat of condensation before saturation the rising air follows the dry adiabatic lapse rate after saturation the rising air follows the moist adiabatic lapse rate 11 the release of latent heat is an important source of energy in the development of thunderstorms while the dry adiabatic lapse rate is a constant 9.8 c km 5.38 f per 1,000 ft 3 c 1,000 ft the moist adiabatic lapse rate varies strongly with temperature a typical value is around 5 c km 9 f km 2.7 f 1,000 ft 1.5 c 1,000 ft 12 the formula for the moist adiabatic lapse rate is given by 13 w g 1 h v r r s d t c p d h v 2 r r s w t 2 g r

at a given time and location as an average the international civil aviation organization icao defines an international standard atmosphere isa with a temperature lapse rate of 6.49 k km 15 3.56 f or 1.98 c 1,000 ft from sea level to 11 km 36,090 ft or 6.8 mi from 11 km up to 20 km 65,620 ft or 12.4 mi the constant temperature is 56.5 c 69.7 f which is the lowest assumed temperature in the isa the standard atmosphere contains no moisture unlike the idealized isa the temperature of the actual atmosphere does not always fall at a uniform rate with height for example there can be an inversion layer in which the temperature increases with altitude effect on weather edit the latent heat of vaporization adds energy to clouds and storms the varying environmental lapse rates throughout the earth s atmosphere are of critical importance in meteorology particularly within the troposphere they are used to determine if the parcel of rising air will rise high enough for its water to condense to form clouds and having formed clouds whether the air will continue to rise and form bigger shower clouds and whether these clouds will get even bigger and form cumulonimbus clouds thunder clouds as unsaturated air rises its temperature drops at the dry adiabatic rate the dew point also drops as a result of decreasing air pressure but much more slowly typically about 2 c per 1,000 m if unsaturated air rises far enough eventually its temperature will reach its dew point and condensation will begin to form this altitude is known as the lifting condensation level lcl when mechanical lift is present and the convective condensation level ccl when mechanical lift is absent in which case the parcel must be heated from below to its convective temperature the cloud base will be somewhere within the layer bounded by these parameters the difference between the dry adiabatic lapse rate and the rate at which the dew point drops is around 8 c per 1,000 m given a difference in temperature and dew point readings on the ground one can easily find the lcl by multiplying the difference by 125 m c if the environmental lapse rate is less than the moist adiabatic lapse rate the air is absolutely stable rising air will cool faster than the surrounding air and lose buoyancy this often happens in the early morning when the air near the ground has cooled overnight cloud formation in stable air is unlikely if the environmental lapse rate is between the moist and dry adiabatic lapse rates the air is conditionally unstable an unsaturated parcel of air does not have sufficient buoyancy to rise to the lcl or ccl and it is stable to weak vertical displacements in either direction if the parcel is saturated it is unstable and will rise to the lcl or ccl and either be halted due to an inversion layer of convective inhibition or if lifting continues deep moist convection dmc may ensue as a parcel rises to the level of free convection lfc after which it enters the free convective layer fcl and usually rises to the equilibrium level el if the environmental lapse rate is larger than the dry adiabatic lapse rate it has a superadiabatic lapse rate the air is absolutely unstable a parcel of air will gain buoyancy as it rises both below and above the lifting condensation level or convective condensation level this often happens in the afternoon mainly over land masses in these conditions the likelihood of cumulus clouds showers or even thunderstorms is increased meteorologists use radiosondes to measure the environmental lapse rate and compare it to the predicted adiabatic lapse rate to forecast the likelihood that air will rise charts of the environmental lapse rate are known as thermodynamic diagrams examples of which include skew-t log-p diagrams and tephigrams see also thermals the difference in moist adiabatic lapse rate and the dry rate is the cause of foehn wind phenomenon also known as chinook winds in parts of north america the phenomenon exists because warm moist air rises through orographic lifting up and over the top of a mountain range or large mountain the temperature decreases with the dry adiabatic lapse rate until it hits the dew point where water vapor in the air begins to condense above that altitude the adiabatic lapse rate decreases to the moist adiabatic lapse rate as the air continues to rise condensation is also commonly followed by precipitation on the top and windward sides of the mountain as the air descends on the leeward side it is warmed by adiabatic compression at the dry adiabatic lapse rate thus the foehn wind at a certain altitude is warmer than the corresponding altitude on the windward side of the mountain range in addition because the air has lost much of its original water vapor content the descending air creates an arid region on the leeward side of the mountain 16 see also edit adiabatic process atmospheric thermodynamics fluid dynamics foehn wind notes edit note in some cases displaystyle gamma or displaystyle alpha can be used to represent the adiabatic lapse rate in order to avoid confusion with other terms symbolized by displaystyle gamma such as the specific heat ratio
