geography ranges from the pacific coast in the west to the sierra nevada mountain range in the east and from the redwood douglas fir forests in the northwest to the mojave desert in the southeast the central valley a major agricultural area dominates the state s center though california is well-known for its warm mediterranean climate the large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior as well as snowy alpine in the mountains what is now california was first settled by various native californian tribes before being explored by a number of european expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries the spanish empire then claimed it as part of alta california in their new spain colony the area became a part of mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the united states in 1848 after the mexican american war the western portion of alta california then was organized and admitted as the 31st state on september 9 1850 the california gold rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an

originally referred to the baja california peninsula of mexico it was later extended to the entire region composed of the current united states states of california nevada and utah and parts of arizona new mexico texas and wyoming 26 spanish explorer francisco de ulloa s initial surveys of the baja california peninsula exploring the western coast of north america led him to believe that it was an island rather than part of the larger continent 27 the name likely derived from the mythical island california in the fictional story of queen calafia as recorded in a 1510 work the adventures of esplandi n by garci rodr guez de montalvo 28 this work was the fifth in a popular spanish chivalric romance series that began with amadis de gaula 29 30 31 32 queen calafia s kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls inhabited by beautiful black women who wore gold armor and lived like amazons as well as griffins and other strange beasts 28 33 34 in the fictional paradise the ruler queen calafia fought alongside muslims and her name may have been chosen to echo the title of a muslim leader the caliph it s possible the name california was meant to imply the island was a caliphate 28 35 know ye that at the right hand of the indies there is an island called california very close to that part of the terrestrial paradise which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them and they lived in the manner of amazons they were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue the island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks chapter clvii of the adventures of esplandi n 36 the conventional wisdom that california was an island with maps drawn to reflect this belief lasted as late as the 18th century 37 shortened forms of the state s name include ca cal calif and us-ca history a map of california tribal groups and languages at the time of european contact the first inhabitants settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years california was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-columbian north america various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000 38 the indigenous peoples of california included more than 70 distinct groups of native americans ranging from large settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior california groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands tribes villages and on the resource-rich coasts large chiefdoms such as the chumash pomo and salinan trade intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups colonial and spanish periods mission san diego de alcal drawn as it was in 1848 established in 1769 it was the first of the california missions the russian empire established their largest settlement in california at fort ross in 1812 the first european effort to explore the coast as far north as the russian river was a spanish sailing expedition led by portuguese captain juan rodr guez cabrillo in 1542 some 37 years later english explorer francis drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the california coast in 1579 spanish traders made unintended visits with the manila galleons on their return trips from the philippines beginning in 1565 39 the first asians to set foot on what would be the united states occurred in 1587 when filipino sailors arrived in spanish ships at morro bay 40 sebasti n vizca no explored and mapped the coast of california in 1602 for new spain despite the on-the-ground explorations of california in the 16th century rodr guez s idea of california as an island persisted that depiction appeared on many european maps well into the 18th century 41 after the portol expedition of 1769 70 spanish missionaries began setting up 21 california missions on or near the coast of alta upper california beginning in san diego during the same period spanish military forces built several forts presidios and three small towns pueblos the san francisco mission grew into the city of san francisco and two of the pueblos grew into the cities of los angeles and san jose several other smaller cities and towns also sprang up surrounding the various spanish missions and pueblos which remain to this day the spanish colonization began the genocide of the indigenous californian peoples decimating their numbers through epidemics of various diseases for which the indigenous peoples had no natural immunity such as measles and diphtheria 42 the establishment of the spanish systems of government and social structure which the spanish settlers had brought with them also technologically and culturally overwhelmed the societies of the earlier indigenous peoples during this same period russian ships also explored along the california coast and in 1812 established a trading post at fort ross russia s early 19th-century coastal settlements in california were positioned just north of the northernmost edge of the area of spanish settlement in san francisco bay and were the southernmost russian settlements in north america the russian settlements associated with fort ross were spread over an area stretching from point arena to tomales bay 43 california under mexican rule map showing alta california in 1838 when it was a sparsely populated mexican province 44 in 1821 the mexican war of independence gave mexico including california independence from spain for the next 25 years alta california remained as a remote sparsely populated northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of mexico cattle ranches or ranchos emerged as the dominant institutions of mexican california soon after mexican independence from spain the chain of missions became the property of the mexican government and was secularized by 1834 45 the ranchos developed under ownership by californios spanish-speaking californians who had received land grants and traded cowhides and tallow with boston merchants from the 1820s trappers and settlers from the united states and the future canada arrived in northern california these new arrivals used the siskiyou trail california trail oregon trail and old spanish trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding california the early government of the newly independent mexico was highly unstable and in a reflection of this from 1831 onwards california also experienced a series of armed disputes both between regional areas and also revolts against the central mexican government 46 during this tumultuous political period juan bautista alvarado was able to secure the governorship from 1836 - 1842 47 the military action which first brought alvarado to power had momentarily declared california to be an independent state and had been aided by american and british residents of california 48 including isaac graham 49 in 1840 one hundred of those residents who did not have passports were arrested leading to the graham affair 48 one of the largest ranchers in california was john marsh after failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the mexican courts he determined that california should become part of the united states marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the california climate soil and other reasons to settle there as well as the best route to follow which became known as marsh s route his letters were read reread passed around and printed in newspapers throughout the country and started the first wagon trains rolling to california 50 he invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled and assisted in their obtaining passports 51 after ushering in the period of organized emigration to california marsh helped end the rule of the last mexican governor of california thereby paving the way to california s ultimate acquisition by the united states 52 california republic and american invasion the original of todd s bear flag photographed in 1890 in 1846 a group of american settlers in and around sonoma rebelled against mexican rule during the bear flag revolt afterwards rebels raised the bear flag featuring a bear a star a red stripe and the words california republic at sonoma the republic s only president was william b ide 53 who played a pivotal role during the bear flag revolt this revolt by american settlers served as a prelude to the later american military invasion of california and was closely coordinated with nearby american military commanders the california republic was short lived 54 the same year marked the outbreak of the mexican american war 1846 48 55 when commodore john d sloat of the united states navy sailed into monterey bay and began the military occupation of california by the united states northern california capitulated in less than a month to the united states forces 56 after a series of defensive battles in southern california the treaty of cahuenga was signed by the californios on january 13 1847 securing american control in california 57 early american statehood period chinese gold miners in

westernmost portion of the old mexican territory of alta california soon became the american state of california and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new american territories of arizona nevada colorado and utah the lightly populated and arid lower region of old baja california remained as a part of mexico in 1846 the total settler population of the western part of the old alta california had been estimated to be no more than 8,000 plus about 100,000 native americans down from about 300,000 before hispanic settlement in 1769 58 in 1848 only one week before the official american annexation of the area gold was discovered in california this being an event which was to forever alter both the state s demographics and its finances soon afterward a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands the population burgeoned with united states citizens europeans chinese and other immigrants during the great california gold rush by the time of california s application to the us congress for statehood in 1850 the settler population of california had multiplied to 100,000 by 1854 over 300,000 settlers had come 59 between 1847 and 1870 the population of san francisco increased from 500 to 150,000 60 california was suddenly no longer a sparsely populated backwater but seemingly overnight it had grown into a major us population center the seat of government for california under spanish and later mexican rule had been located in monterey from 1777 until 1845 45 pio pico last mexican governor of alta california had briefly moved the capital to los angeles in 1845 the united states consulate had also been located in monterey under consul thomas o larkin in 1849 a state constitutional convention was first held in monterey among the first tasks of the convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital the first full legislative sessions were held in san jose 1850 1851 subsequent locations included vallejo 1852 1853 and nearby benicia 1853 1854 these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well the capital has been located in sacramento since 1854 61 with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in san francisco due to flooding in sacramento once the state s constitutional convention had finalized its state constitution it applied to the us congress for admission to statehood on september 9 1850 as part of the compromise of 1850 california was officially admitted into the united states as an undivided free state its status as a free state prevented the expansion of slavery to the pacific coast which question was then a foremost concern for the pre-civil war us congress within the state of california sep 9 remains as an annually celebrated legal holiday known as california admission day during the american civil war 1861 1865 california was able to send gold shipments eastwards to washington in support of the union cause 62 however due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-south sympathizers within the state the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the union war effort still several smaller military units within the union army were unofficially associated with the state of california such as the california 100 company due to a majority of their members being from california at the time of california s admission into the union travel between california and the rest of the continental united states had been a time consuming and dangerous feat nineteen years afterwards in 1869 shortly after the conclusion of the civil war a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad at promontory summit utah once completed hundreds of thousands of united states citizens were enabled to easily migrate westwards into the state upon their arrival in california the new californians were able to discover that if irrigated during the dry summer months that much of california was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general vast expanses of wheat other cereal crops vegetable crops cotton and nut and fruit trees were grown including oranges in southern california and the foundation was laid for the state s prodigious agricultural production in the central valley and elsewhere indigenous peoples under early american administration group of california indigenous people under earlier spanish and mexican rule california s original native population had precipitously declined above all from eurasian diseases to which the indigenous people of california had not yet developed a natural immunity 63 under its new american administration california s harsh governmental policies towards its own indigenous people did not improve as in other american states many of the native inhabitants were soon forcibly removed from their lands by incoming american settlers such as miners ranchers and farmers although california had entered the american union as a free state the loitering or orphaned indians were de facto enslaved by their new anglo-american masters under the 1853 act for the government and protection of indians 64 there were also massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed between 1850 and 1860 the california state government paid around 1.5 million dollars some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government 65 to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations in later decades the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them 64 as a result the rise of california was a calamity for the native inhabitants several scholars and native american activists including benjamin madley and ed castillo have described the actions of the california government as a genocide 66 20th century hollywood film studios 1922 the birthplace of silicon valley garage where stanford university graduates william hewlett and david packard developed their first product in the 1930s migration to california accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the lincoln highway and route 66 in the period from 1900 to 1965 the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the union in 1940 the census bureau reported california s population as 6.0 hispanic 2.4 asian and 89.5 non-hispanic white 67 to meet the population s needs major engineering feats like the california and los angeles aqueducts the oroville and shasta dams and the bay and golden gate bridges were built across the state the state government also adopted the california master plan for higher education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education meanwhile attracted to the mild mediterranean climate cheap land and the state s wide variety of geography filmmakers established the studio system in hollywood in the 1920s california manufactured 8.7 percent of total united states military armaments produced during world war ii ranking third behind new york and michigan among the 48 states 68 california however easily ranked first in production of military ships during the war transport cargo merchant ships such as liberty ships victory ships and warships at drydock facilities in san diego los angeles and the san francisco bay area 69 70 71 72 after world war ii california s economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries 73 whose size decreased following the end of the cold war 73 74 stanford university and its dean of engineering frederick terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in california instead of leaving the state and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as silicon valley 75 as a result of these efforts california is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries of technology engineering and the aerospace industry and as the united states center of agricultural production 76 just before the dot com bust california had the fifth-largest economy in the world among nations 77 yet since 1991 and starting in the late 1980s in southern california california has seen a net loss of domestic migrants most years this is often referred to by the media as the california exodus 78 during the 20th century two great disasters

comprising the 10 southernmost counties 82 83 and northern california comprising the 48 northernmost counties 84 85 it is bordered by oregon to the north nevada to the east and northeast arizona to the southeast the pacific ocean to the west and it shares an international border with the mexican state of baja california to the south in the middle of the state lies the california central valley bounded by the sierra nevada in the east the coastal mountain ranges in the west the cascade range to the north and by the tehachapi mountains in the south the central valley is california s productive agricultural heartland divided in two by the sacramento-san joaquin river delta the northern portion the sacramento valley serves as the watershed of the sacramento river while the southern portion the san joaquin valley is the watershed for the san joaquin river both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them with dredging the sacramento and the san joaquin rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports the sacramento-san joaquin river delta is a critical water supply hub for the state water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state to the central valley and the state water projects and other needs water from the delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people almost two-thirds of the state s population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the san joaquin valley suisun bay lies at the confluence of the sacramento and san joaquin rivers the water is drained by the carquinez strait which flows into san pablo bay a northern extension of san francisco bay which then connects to the pacific ocean via the golden gate strait

falls to arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers including palisade glacier the southernmost glacier in the united states about 45 percent of the state s total surface area is covered by forests 86 and california s diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state california contains more forestland than any other state except alaska many of the trees in the california white mountains are the oldest in the world an individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old 87 88 in the south is a large inland salt lake the salton sea the south-central desert is called the mojave to the northeast of the mojave lies death valley which contains the lowest and hottest place in north america the badwater basin at 279 feet 85 m 10 the horizontal distance from the bottom of death valley to the top of mount whitney is less than 90 miles 140 km indeed almost all of southeastern california is arid hot desert with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer the southeastern border of california with arizona is entirely formed by the colorado river from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water a majority of california s cities are located in either the san francisco bay area or the sacramento metropolitan area in northern california or the los angeles area the riverside-san bernardino-inland empire or the san diego metropolitan area in southern california the los angeles area the bay area and the san diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the california coast as part of the ring of fire california is subject to tsunamis floods droughts santa ana winds wildfires landslides on steep terrain and has several volcanoes it has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state in particular the san andreas fault about 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year but most are too small to be felt 89 climate although most of the state has a mediterranean climate due to the state s large size the climate ranges from subarctic to subtropical the cool california current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast farther inland there are colder winters and hotter summers the maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of los angeles and san francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the united states and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the north american continent even the san diego shoreline bordering mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous united states just a few miles inland summer temperature extremes are significantly higher with downtown los angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast the same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the bay area where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas that are close to the ocean northern parts of the state have more rain than the south california s mountain ranges also influence the climate some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes northwestern california has a temperate climate and the central valley has a mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast the high mountains including the sierra nevada have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer california s mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side creating extensive deserts the higher elevation deserts of eastern california have hot summers and cold winters while the low deserts east of the southern california mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters death valley a desert with large expanses below sea level is

includes some of the most endangered ecological communities california is part of the nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions 93 california s large number of endemic species includes relict species which have died out elsewhere such as the catalina ironwood lyonothamnus floribundus many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the california lilac ceanothus many california endemics have become endangered as urbanization logging overgrazing and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat flora and fauna california boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora the largest trees the tallest trees and the oldest trees california s native grasses are perennial plants 94 after european contact these were generally replaced by invasive species of european annual grasses and in modern times california s hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer 95 because california has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain the state has six life zones which are the lower sonoran desert upper sonoran foothill regions and some coastal lands transition coastal areas and moist northeastern counties and the canadian hudsonian and arctic zones comprising the state s highest elevations 96 plant life in the dry climate of the lower sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus mesquite and paloverde the joshua tree is found in the mojave desert flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the central valley the upper sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt characterized by forests of small shrubs stunted trees and herbaceous plants nemophila mint phacelia viola and the california poppy eschscholzia californica the state flower also flourish in this zone along with the lupine more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world 96 the transition zone includes most of california s forests with the redwood sequoia sempervirens and the big tree or giant sequoia sequoiadendron giganteum among the oldest living things on earth some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years tanbark oak california laurel sugar pine madrona broad-leaved maple and douglas-fir also grow here forest floors are covered with swordfern alumnroot barrenwort and trillium and there are thickets of huckleberry azalea elder and wild currant characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa tulip and tiger and leopard lilies 97 the high elevations of the canadian zone allow the jeffrey pine red fir and lodgepole pine to thrive brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus the unique sierra puffball is also found here right below the timberline in the hudsonian zone the whitebark foxtail and silver pines grow at about 10,500 feet 3,200 m begins
