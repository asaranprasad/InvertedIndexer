aligning torque on the object from an externally applied magnetic field to the field vector itself the relationship is given by 1 b displaystyle boldsymbol tau boldsymbol mu times mathbf b where is the torque acting on the dipole b is the external magnetic field and is the magnetic moment this definition is based on how one would measure the magnetic moment in principle of an unknown sample if possible units edit the unit for magnetic moment is not a base unit in the international system of units si as the torque is measured in newton-meters n m and the magnetic field in teslas t the magnetic moment is measured in newton-meters per tesla this has equivalents in other base units 2 3 n m t a m 2 where a is amperes in the cgs system there are several different sets of electromagnetism units of which the main ones are esu gaussian and emu among these there are two alternative non-equivalent units of magnetic dipole moment 1 stata cm 2 6986333564095000000 3.33564095

non-equivalent cgs units emu esu is equal to the speed of light in free space expressed in cm s 1 all formulae in this article are correct in si units they may need to be changed for use in other unit systems for example in si units a loop of current with current i and area a has magnetic moment ia see below but in gaussian units the magnetic moment is ia c two representations of the cause of the magnetic moment edit the preferred classical explanation of a magnetic moment has changed over time before the 1930s textbooks explained the moment using hypothetical magnetic point charges since then most have defined it in terms of amp rian currents 4 in magnetic materials the cause of the magnetic moment are the spin and orbital angular momentum states of the electrons and varies depending on whether atoms in one region are aligned with atoms in another magnetic pole representation edit an electrostatic analog for a magnetic moment two opposing charges separated by a finite distance the sources of magnetic moments in materials can be represented by poles in analogy to electrostatics consider a bar magnet which has magnetic poles of equal magnitude but opposite polarity each pole is the source of magnetic force which weakens with distance since magnetic poles always come in pairs their forces partially cancel each other because while one pole pulls the other repels this cancellation is greatest when the poles are close to each other i e when the bar magnet is short the magnetic force produced by a bar magnet at a given point in space therefore depends on two factors the strength p of its poles magnetic pole strength and the vector l separating them the moment is related to the fictitious poles as 4 p l displaystyle mathbf mu p boldsymbol l it points in the direction from south to north pole the analogy with electric dipoles should not be taken too far because magnetic dipoles are associated with angular momentum see magnetic moment and angular momentum nevertheless magnetic poles are very useful for magnetostatic calculations particularly in applications to ferromagnets 4 practitioners using the magnetic pole approach generally represent the magnetic field by the irrotational field h in analogy to the electric field e integral representation edit moment of a planar current having magnitude i and enclosing an area s we start from the definition of the differential magnetic moment pseudovector 1 2 r j displaystyle boldsymbol mu tfrac 1 2 mathbf r times mathbf j where is the vector cross product r is the position vector and j is the electric current density it is very similar to the differential angular momentum defined as l r v displaystyle boldsymbol l mathbf r times rho mathbf v where is the mass density and v is the velocity vector like in every pseudovector by convention the direction of the cross product is given by the right hand grip rule 5 practitioners using the current loop model generally represent the magnetic field by the solenoidal field b analogous to the electrostatic field d the integral magnetic moment of a charge distribution is therefore m 1 2 v r j d v displaystyle boldsymbol mathrm m tfrac 1 2 iiint v mathbf r times mathbf j rm d v let us start with a point particle in this simple situation the magnetic moment is m 1 2 q r v displaystyle boldsymbol mathrm m tfrac 1 2 q mathbf r times mathbf v where r is the position of the electric charge q relative to the center of the circle and v is the instantaneous velocity of the charge giving an electric current density j on the other hand for a point particle the angular momentum is defined as l r p m r v displaystyle boldsymbol l mathbf r times mathbf p m mathbf r times mathbf v and in the planar case m 1 2 s r j d s displaystyle boldsymbol

theorem integral magnetic moment then becomes expressible as m i s displaystyle boldsymbol mathrm m i mathbf s the factor 1 2 in our definition above is only due to historical reason the old definition of the magnetic moment was this last integral equation if one had started from a differential definition r j displaystyle boldsymbol mu mathbf r times mathbf j then the coherent integral expression would have been m 2 i s displaystyle boldsymbol mathrm m 2i mathbf s magnetic moment of a solenoid edit image of a solenoid a generalization of the above current loop is a coil or solenoid its moment is the vector sum of the moments of individual turns if the solenoid has n identical turns single-layer winding and vector area s n i s displaystyle boldsymbol mu ni mathbf s magnetic moment and angular momentum edit the magnetic moment has a close connection with angular momentum called the gyromagnetic effect this effect is expressed on a macroscopic scale in the einstein-de haas effect or rotation by magnetization and its inverse the barnett effect or magnetization by rotation 1 in particular when a magnetic moment is subject to a torque in a magnetic field that tends to align it with the applied magnetic field the moment precesses rotates about the axis of the applied field this is a consequence of the concomitance of magnetic moment and angular momentum that in case of charged massive particles corresponds to the concomitance of charge and mass in a particle viewing a magnetic dipole as a rotating charged particle brings out the close connection between magnetic moment and angular momentum both the magnetic moment and the angular momentum increase with the rate of rotation the ratio of the two is called the gyromagnetic ratio and is simply the half of the charge-to-mass ratio 6 7 for a spinning charged solid with a uniform charge density to mass density ratio the gyromagnetic ratio is equal to half the charge-to-mass ratio this implies that a more massive assembly of charges spinning with the same angular momentum will have a proportionately weaker magnetic moment compared to its lighter counterpart even though atomic particles cannot be accurately described as spinning charge distributions of uniform charge-to-mass ratio this general trend can be observed in the atomic world where the intrinsic angular momentum spin of each type of particle is a constant a small half-integer times the reduced planck constant this is the basis for defining the magnetic moment units of bohr magneton assuming charge-to-mass ratio of the electron and nuclear magneton assuming charge-to-mass ratio of the proton effects of an external magnetic field on a magnetic moment edit force on a moment edit a magnetic moment in an externally produced magnetic field has a potential energy u u b displaystyle u - boldsymbol mu cdot mathbf b in a case when the external magnetic field is non-uniform there will be a force proportional to the magnetic field gradient acting on the magnetic moment itself there has been some discussion on how to calculate the force acting on a magnetic dipole there are two expressions for the force acting on a magnetic dipole depending on whether the model used for the dipole is a current loop or two monopoles analogous to the electric dipole 8 the force obtained in the case of a current loop model is f loop b displaystyle mathbf f text loop nabla left boldsymbol mu cdot mathbf b right in the case of a pair of monopoles being used i e electric dipole model f dipole b displaystyle mathbf f text dipole

nabla times mathbf b right in all these expressions is the dipole and b is the magnetic field at its position note that if there are no currents or time-varying electrical fields b 0 and the two expressions agree an electron nucleus or atom placed in a uniform magnetic field will precess with a frequency known as the larmor frequency see resonance magnetic dipoles edit a magnetic dipole is the limit of either a current loop or a pair of poles as the dimensions of the source are reduced to zero while keeping the moment constant as long as these limits only apply to fields far from the sources they are equivalent however the two models give different predictions for the internal field see below external magnetic field produced by a magnetic dipole moment edit magnetic field lines around a magnetostatic dipole the magnetic dipole itself is located in the center of the figure seen from the side and pointing upward any system possessing a net magnetic dipole moment m will produce a dipolar magnetic field described below in the space surrounding the system while the net magnetic field produced by the system can also have higher-order multipole components those will drop off with distance more rapidly so that only the dipolar component will dominate the magnetic field of the system at distances far away from it in three dimensions the vector potential of the magnetic

field of a dipole edit the magnetic field of a current loop the two models for a dipole current loop and magnetic poles give the same predictions for the magnetic field far from the source however inside the source region they give different predictions the magnetic field between poles see figure for magnetic pole definition is in the opposite direction to the magnetic moment which points from the negative charge to the positive charge while inside a current loop it is in the same direction see the figure to the right the limits of these fields must also be different as the sources shrink to zero size this distinction only matters if the dipole limit is used to calculate fields inside a magnetic material 4 if a magnetic dipole is formed by making a current loop smaller and smaller but

contributions to any system s magnetic moment may come from sources of two kinds motion of electric charges such as electric currents and the intrinsic magnetism of elementary particles such as the electron contributions due to the sources of the first kind can be calculated from knowing the distribution of all the electric currents or alternatively of all the electric charges and their velocities inside the system by using the formulas below on the other hand the magnitude of each elementary particle s intrinsic magnetic moment is a fixed number often measured experimentally to a great precision for example any electron s magnetic moment is measured to be 3023071523600000000 9.284764 10 24 j t 13 the direction of the magnetic moment of any elementary particle is entirely determined by the direction of its spin with the negative value indicating that any electron s magnetic moment is antiparallel to its spin the net magnetic moment of any system is a vector sum of contributions from one or both types of sources for example the magnetic moment of an atom of hydrogen-1 the lightest hydrogen isotope consisting of a proton and an electron is a vector sum of the following contributions the intrinsic moment of the electron the orbital motion of the electron around the proton the intrinsic moment of the proton similarly the magnetic moment of a bar magnet is the sum of the contributing magnetic moments which include the intrinsic and orbital magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons of the magnet s material and the nuclear magnetic moments magnetic moment of an atom edit for an atom individual electron spins are added to get a total spin and individual orbital angular momenta are added to get a total orbital angular momentum these two then are added using angular momentum coupling to get a total angular momentum for an atom with no nuclear magnetic moment the magnitude of the atomic dipole moment is then 14 m atom g j b j j 1 displaystyle m text atom g j mu mathrm b sqrt j j 1 where j is the total angular momentum quantum number gj is the land g-factor and b is the bohr magneton the component of this magnetic moment along the direction of the magnetic field is then 15 m atom z m g j b displaystyle m text atom z -mg j mu mathrm b where m is called the magnetic quantum number or the equatorial quantum number which can take on any of 2j 1 values 16 j j 1 0 j 1 j displaystyle -j - j-1 cdots 0 cdots j-1 j dubious discuss the negative sign occurs because electrons have negative charge due to the angular momentum the dynamics of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field differs from that of an electric dipole in an electric field the field does exert a torque on the magnetic dipole tending to align it with the field however torque is proportional to rate of change of angular momentum so precession occurs the direction of spin changes this behavior is described by the landau lifshitz gilbert equation 17 18 1 d m d t m h eff m m d m d t displaystyle frac 1 gamma frac rm d mathbf m rm d t mathbf m times h text eff - frac lambda gamma m mathbf m times frac rm d mathbf m rm d t where is the gyromagnetic ratio m is the magnetic moment is the damping coefficient and heff is the effective magnetic field the external field plus any self-induced field the first term describes precession of the moment about the effective field while the second is a damping term related to dissipation of energy caused by interaction with the surroundings magnetic moment of an electron edit electrons and many elementary particles also have intrinsic magnetic moments an explanation of which requires a quantum mechanical treatment and relates to the intrinsic angular momentum of the particles as discussed in the article electron magnetic moment it is these intrinsic magnetic moments that give rise to the macroscopic effects of magnetism and other phenomena such as electron paramagnetic resonance the magnetic moment of the electron is m s g s b s displaystyle mathbf m text s - frac g s mu text b mathbf s hbar where b is the bohr magneton s is electron spin and the g-factor gs is 2 according to dirac s theory but due to quantum electrodynamic effects it is slightly larger in reality 7000200231930435999 2.00231930436 the deviation from 2 is known as the anomalous magnetic dipole moment again it is important to notice that m is a negative constant multiplied by the spin so the magnetic moment of the electron is antiparallel to the spin this can be understood with the following classical picture if we imagine that the spin angular momentum is created by the electron mass spinning around some axis the electric current that this rotation creates circulates in the opposite direction because of the negative charge of the electron such current loops produce a magnetic moment which is antiparallel to the spin hence for a positron the anti-particle of the electron the magnetic moment is parallel to its spin magnetic moment of a nucleus edit the nuclear system is a complex physical system consisting of nucleons i e protons and neutrons the quantum mechanical properties of the nucleons include the spin among others since the electromagnetic moments of the nucleus depend on the spin of the individual nucleons one can look at these properties with measurements of nuclear moments and more specifically the nuclear magnetic dipole moment most common nuclei exist in their ground state although nuclei of some isotopes have long-lived excited states each energy state of a nucleus of a given isotope is characterized by a well-defined magnetic dipole moment the magnitude of which is a fixed number often measured experimentally to a great precision this number is very sensitive to the individual contributions from nucleons and a measurement or prediction of its value can reveal important information about the content of the nuclear wave function there are several theoretical models that predict the value of the magnetic dipole moment and a number of experimental techniques aiming to carry out measurements in nuclei along the nuclear chart magnetic moment of a molecule edit any molecule has a well-defined magnitude of magnetic moment which may depend on the molecule s energy state typically the overall magnetic moment of a molecule is a combination of the following contributions in the order of their typical strength magnetic moments due to its unpaired electron spins paramagnetic contribution if any orbital motion of its electrons which in the ground state is often proportional to the external magnetic field diamagnetic contribution the combined magnetic moment of its nuclear spins which depends on the nuclear spin configuration examples of molecular magnetism edit the dioxygen molecule o2 exhibits strong paramagnetism due to unpaired spins of its outermost two electrons the carbon dioxide molecule co2 mostly exhibits diamagnetism a much weaker magnetic moment of the electron orbitals that is proportional to the external magnetic field the nuclear magnetism of a magnetic isotope such as 13c or 17o will contribute to the molecule s magnetic moment the dihydrogen molecule h2 in a weak or zero magnetic field exhibits nuclear magnetism and can be in a para- or an ortho- nuclear spin configuration many transition metal complexes are magnetic the spin-only formula is a good first approximation for high-spin complexes of first-row transition metals 19 full citation needed number of unpaired electrons spin-only moment b 1 1.73 2 2.83 3 3.87 4 4.90 5 5.92 elementary particles
