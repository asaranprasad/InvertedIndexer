space probes operational as of december 2016 a space probe is a robotic spacecraft that does not orbit the earth but instead explores further into outer space 1 a space probe may approach the moon travel through interplanetary space flyby orbit or land on other planetary bodies or enter interstellar space see list of active solar system probes for a list of active probes the space agencies of the ussr now russia and ukraine the united states the european union japan china and india have in the aggregate launched probes to several planets and moons of the solar system as well as to a number of asteroids and comets approximately fifteen missions are currently operational 2 contents 1 interplanetary trajectories 2 some notable probes 2.1 luna 9 2.2 luna 3 2.3 luna 16 2.4 lunokhod 1 2.5

earth its trajectory will likely take it along an orbit around the sun similar to the earth s orbit to reach another planet the simplest practical method is a hohmann transfer orbit more complex techniques such as gravitational slingshots can be more fuel-efficient though they may require the probe to spend more time in transit some high delta-v missions such as those with high inclination changes can only be performed within the limits of modern propulsion using gravitational slingshots a technique using very little propulsion but requiring a considerable amount of time is to follow a trajectory on the interplanetary transport network 3 some notable probes edit the lunokhod 1 unmanned rover on the surface of moon displayed in memorial museum of cosmonautics the curiosity rover on the surface of mars the rosetta orbiter and philae lander nearing comet 67p voyager 2 in interplanetary space artist s concept of deep impact prior to its planned collision with comet tempel 1 luna 9 edit first man-made object to soft land on the moon or any other extra terrestrial surface 4 luna 3 edit first mission to photograph the far side of the moon launched in 1959 luna 16 edit first robotic sample return probe from the moon lunokhod 1 edit first rover on moon it was sent to the moon on november 10 1970 mariner 10 edit first probe to mercury venera 4 edit first successful in-place analysis of another planet it may have also been the first space probe to impact the surface of another planet although it is unclear whether it reached venus surface 5 venera 7 edit the venera 7 probe was the first spacecraft to successfully soft land on another planet venus and to transmit data from there back to earth mariner 9 edit upon its arrival at mars on november 13 1971 mariner 9 became the first space probe to maintain orbit around another planet 6 the huygens landing site on titan mars 3 edit first soft landing on mars december 2 1971 7 the lander began transmitting to the mars 3 orbiter 90 seconds after landing after 20 seconds transmission stopped for unknown reasons 7 sojourner edit first successful rover on mars 8 spirit and opportunity edit the mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity surface and geology and searched for clues to past water activity on mars they were each launched in 2003 and landed in 2004 communication with spirit stopped on sol 2210 march 22 2010 9 10 jpl continued to attempt to regain contact until may 24 2011 when nasa announced that efforts to communicate with the unresponsive rover had ended 11 12 13 opportunity arrived at endeavour crater on 9 august 2011 at a landmark called spirit point named after its rover twin after traversing 13 miles 21 km from victoria crater over a three-year period 14 as of january 26 2016 opportunity has lasted for more than twelve years on mars although the rovers were intended to last only three months halley armada edit the first dedicated missions to a comet in this case to halley s comet during its 1985 86 journey through the inner solar system it was also the first massive international coordination of space probes on an interplanetary mission with probes specifically launched by the soviet now russian space agency european space agency and japan s isas now integrated with nasda to jaxa ice edit originally a solar observatory in the international sun-earth explorer series it was sent into solar orbit to make the first close observations of a comet comet giacobini zinner in 1985 as a prelude to studies of halley s comet vega edit two russian french spacecraft they dropped landers and balloons first weather balloons deployed on another planet at venus before their rendezvous with halley s comet sakigake edit this japanese probe was the first non-us non-soviet interplanetary probe citation needed suisei edit a second japanese probe it made ultraviolet wavelength observations of the comet clarification needed giotto edit the first space probe to penetrate a comet s coma and take close-up images of its nucleus genesis edit first solar wind sample return probe from sun-earth l1 15 stardust edit first sample return probe from a comet tail near shoemaker edit first probe to land on an asteroid hayabusa edit first sample return probe to launch from an asteroid rosetta edit the rosetta space probe flew by two asteroids and made a rendezvous and orbited comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko in november 2014 16 pioneer 10 edit first probe to jupiter radio communications were lost with pioneer 10 on january 23 2003 because of the loss of electric power for its radio transmitter with the probe at a distance of 12 billion kilometers 80 au from earth pioneer 11 edit first probe to fly by two planets and first probe to saturn communications were lost due to power constraints and vast distance voyager 1 edit voyager 1 s view of solar system artist s impression 17 voyager 1 is a 733-kilogram probe launched september 5 1977 it is currently still operational making it the longest-lasting mission of the u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa it visited jupiter and saturn and was the first probe to provide detailed images of the moons of these planets voyager 1 is the farthest human-made object from earth traveling away from both the earth and the sun at a relatively faster speed than any other probe 18 as of september 12 2013 voyager 1 is about 12 billion miles 19 billion kilometers from the sun 19 on august 25 2012 voyager 1 became the first human made object to enter interstellar space 20 voyager 1 has not had a functioning plasma sensor since 1980 but a solar flare in 2012 allowed scientists from nasa to measure vibrations of the plasma surrounding the craft the vibrations allowed scientists to measure the plasma to be much denser than measurements taken in the far layers of our heliosphere thus concluding the craft had broken beyond the heliopause voyager 2 edit voyager 2 was launched by nasa on august 20 1977 the probe s primary mission was to visit the ice giants uranus and neptune which it completed on october 2 1989 it is currently the only probe to have visited the ice giants it is the fourth of five spacecraft to have left the solar system it has been operational for 40 years and 5 months as of january 20 2018 cassini huygens edit cassini huygens was a 5,712kg 12,593lb space probe designed to study gas giant saturn along with its ringed system and moons the nasa probe was launched with esa lander huygens on october 1 1997 from cape canaveral the cassini probe entered saturn orbit on july 1 2004 and huygens landed on titan saturn s largest moon on january 14 2005 21 on september 15 2017 the probe was de-orbited and burned up in saturn s atmosphere after almost 20 years in
