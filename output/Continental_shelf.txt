cold seeps demersal zone benthic zone v t the continental shelf is an underwater landmass which extends from a continent resulting in an area of relatively shallow water known as a shelf sea much of the shelves were exposed during glacial periods and interglacial periods the shelf surrounding an island is known as an insular shelf the continental margin between the continental shelf and the abyssal plain comprises a steep continental slope followed by the flatter continental rise sediment from the continent above cascades down the slope and accumulates as a pile of sediment at the base of the slope called the continental rise extending as far as 500 km 310 mi from the slope it consists of thick sediments deposited by turbidity currents from the shelf and slope 1 the continental rise s gradient is intermediate between the slope and the shelf under the united nations convention on the law of the sea the name continental shelf was given a legal definition as the stretch of the seabed adjacent to the shores of a particular country to which it belongs contents 1 geographical distribution 2 topography 3 sediments 4 biota 5 economic significance 6 see also 7 notes 8 references 9 external links geographical distribution edit the global continental shelf highlighted in cyan the width of the continental shelf varies considerably it is not uncommon for an area to have virtually no shelf at all particularly where the forward edge of an advancing oceanic plate dives beneath continental crust in an offshore subduction zone such as off the coast of chile or the west coast of sumatra the largest shelf the siberian shelf in the arctic ocean stretches to 1,500 kilometers 930 mi in width the south china sea lies over another extensive area of continental shelf the sunda shelf which joins borneo sumatra and java to the asian mainland other familiar bodies of water that overlie continental shelves are the north sea and the persian gulf the average width of continental shelves is about 80 km 50 mi the depth of the shelf also varies but is generally limited to water shallower than 150 m 490 ft 2 the slope of the shelf is usually quite low on the order of 0.5 vertical relief is also minimal at less than 20 m 66 ft 3 though the continental shelf is treated as a physiographic province of the ocean it is not part of the deep ocean basin proper but the flooded margins of the continent 4 passive continental margins such as most of the atlantic coasts have wide and shallow shelves made of thick sedimentary wedges derived from long erosion of a neighboring continent active continental margins have narrow relatively steep shelves due to frequent earthquakes that move sediment to the deep sea 5 topography edit the shelf usually ends at a point of increasing slope 6 called the shelf break the sea floor below the break is the continental slope below the slope is the continental rise which finally merges into the deep ocean floor the abyssal plain the continental shelf and the slope are part of the continental margin the shelf area is commonly subdivided into the inner continental shelf mid continental shelf and outer continental shelf each with their specific geomorphology and marine biology the character of the shelf changes dramatically at the shelf break where the continental slope begins with a few exceptions the shelf break is located at a remarkably uniform depth of roughly 140 m 460 ft this is likely a hallmark of past ice ages when sea level was lower than it is now 7 the continental slope is much steeper than the shelf the average angle is 3 but it can be as low as 1 or as high as 10 8 the slope is often cut with submarine canyons the physical mechanisms involved in forming these canyons were not well understood until the 1960s 9 sediments edit the continental shelves are covered by terrigenous sediments that is those derived from erosion of the continents however little of the sediment is from current rivers some 60 70 of the sediment on the world s shelves is relict sediment deposited during the last ice age when sea level was 100 120 m lower than it is now 10 sediments usually become increasingly fine with distance from the coast sand is limited to shallow wave-agitated waters while silt and clays are deposited in quieter deep water far offshore 11 these accumulate 15 40 cm every millennium much faster than deep-sea pelagic sediments 12 biota edit continental shelves teem with life because of the sunlight available in shallow waters in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans abyssal plain the pelagic water column environment of the continental shelf constitutes the neritic zone and the benthic sea floor province of the shelf is the sublittoral zone 13 though the shelves are usually fertile if anoxic conditions prevail during sedimentation the deposits may over geologic time become sources for fossil fuels economic significance edit the relatively accessible continental shelf is the best understood part of the ocean floor most commercial exploitation from the sea such as metallic-ore non-metallic ore and hydrocarbon extraction takes place on the continental shelf sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200 metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the convention on the continental shelf drawn up by the un s international law commission in 1958 this was partly superseded by the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea 14 which created the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone plus continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance the legal definition of a continental shelf differs significantly from the geological definition unclos states that the shelf extends to the limit of the continental margin but no less than 200 nautical miles and no more than 350 nm from the baseline thus inhabited volcanic islands such as the canaries which have no actual continental shelf nonetheless have a legal continental shelf whereas uninhabitable islands have no shelf see also edit
