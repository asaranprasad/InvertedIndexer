occurring in different types of ore deposits are crystalline small flakes of graphite or flake graphite occurs as isolated flat plate-like particles with hexagonal edges if unbroken when broken the edges can be irregular or angular amorphous graphite very fine flake graphite is sometimes called amorphous 6 lump graphite or vein graphite occurs in fissure veins or fractures and appears as massive platy intergrowths of fibrous or acicular crystalline aggregates and is probably hydrothermal in origin 7 highly ordered pyrolytic graphite refers to graphite with an angular spread between the graphite sheets of less than 1 8 the name graphite fiber is sometimes used to refer to carbon fibers or carbon fiber-reinforced polymer occurrence edit graphite output in 2005 graphite occurs in metamorphic rocks as a result of the reduction of sedimentary carbon compounds during metamorphism it also occurs in igneous rocks and in meteorites 4 minerals associated with graphite include quartz calcite micas and tourmaline in meteorites it occurs with troilite and silicate minerals 4 small graphitic crystals in meteoritic iron are called cliftonite 7 according to the united states geological survey usgs world production of natural graphite in 2016 was 1,200,000 tonnes of which the following major exporters are china 780 kt india 170 kt brazil 80 kt turkey 32 kt and north korea 30 kt 9 graphite is not mined in the united states but u s production of synthetic graphite in 2010 was 134 kt valued at 1.07 billion 10 properties edit structure edit graphite has a layered planar structure the individual layers are called graphene in each layer the carbon atoms are arranged in a honeycomb lattice with separation of 0.142 nm and the distance between planes is 0.335 nm 11 atoms in the plane are bonded covalently with only three of the four potential bonding sites satisfied the fourth electron is free to migrate in the plane making graphite electrically conductive however it does not conduct in a direction at right angles to the plane bonding between layers is via weak van der waals bonds which allows layers of graphite to be easily separated or to slide past each other the two known forms of graphite alpha hexagonal and beta rhombohedral have very similar physical properties except for that the graphene layers stack slightly differently 12 the alpha graphite may be either flat or buckled 13 the alpha form can be converted to the beta form through mechanical treatment and the beta form reverts to the alpha form when it is heated above 1300 c 14 scanning tunneling microscope image of graphite surface atoms graphite s unit cell animated view of the unit cell in three layers of graphene note that this is a slightly different unit cell from the one to the left ball-and-stick model of graphite two graphene layers side view of layer stacking plane view of layer stacking rotating graphite stereogram other properties edit graphite plates and sheets 10 15 cm high mineral specimen from kimmirut baffin island the acoustic and thermal properties of graphite are highly anisotropic since phonons propagate quickly along the tightly-bound planes but are slower to travel from one plane to another graphite s high thermal stability and electrical and thermal conductivity facilitate its widespread use as electrodes and refractories in high temperature material processing applications however in oxygen containing atmospheres graphite readily oxidizes to form co2 at temperatures of 700 c and above 15 molar volume vs pressure at room temperature graphite is an electric conductor consequently useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes it can conduct electricity due to the vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers a phenomenon called aromaticity these valence electrons are free to move so are able to conduct electricity however the electricity is primarily conducted within the plane of the layers the conductive properties of powdered graphite 16 allow its use as pressure sensor in carbon microphones graphite and graphite powder are valued in industrial applications for their self-lubricating and dry lubricating properties there is a common belief that graphite s lubricating properties are solely due to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure 17 however it has been shown that in a vacuum environment such as in technologies for use in space graphite degrades as a lubricant due to the hypoxic conditions 18 this observation led to the hypothesis that the lubrication is due to the presence of fluids between the layers such as air and water which are naturally adsorbed from the environment this hypothesis has been refuted by studies showing that air and water are not absorbed 19 recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for graphite s lubricating properties the use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate pitting corrosion in some stainless steel 20 21 and to promote galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals due to its electrical conductivity it is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture for this reason the us air force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft 22 and discouraged its use in aluminium-containing automatic weapons 23 even graphite pencil marks on aluminium parts may facilitate corrosion 24 another high-temperature lubricant hexagonal boron nitride has the same molecular structure as graphite it is sometimes called white graphite due to its similar properties when a large number of crystallographic defects bind these planes together graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as pyrolytic graphite it is also highly anisotropic and diamagnetic thus it will float in mid-air above a strong magnet if it is made in a fluidized bed at 1000 1300 c then it is isotropic turbostratic and is used in blood contacting devices like mechanical heart valves and is called pyrolytic carbon and is not diamagnetic pyrolytic graphite and pyrolytic carbon are often confused but are very different materials citation needed natural and crystalline graphites are not often used in pure form as structural materials due to their shear-planes brittleness and inconsistent mechanical properties history of natural graphite use edit in the 4th millennium b c during the neolithic age in southeastern europe the mari a culture used graphite in a ceramic paint for decorating pottery 25 some time before 1565 some sources say as early as 1500 an enormous deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to grey knotts from the hamlet of seathwaite in borrowdale parish cumbria england which the locals found very useful for marking sheep 26 27 during the reign of elizabeth i 1533 1603 borrowdale graphite was used as a refractory material to line moulds for cannonballs resulting in rounder smoother balls that could be fired farther contributing to the strength of the english navy this particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and soft and could easily be cut into sticks because of its military importance this unique mine and its production were strictly controlled by the crown 28 other names edit historically graphite was called black lead or plumbago 7 29 plumbago was commonly used in its massive mineral form both of these names arise from confusion with the similar-appearing lead ores particularly galena the latin word for lead plumbum gave its name to the english term for this grey metallic-sheened mineral and even to the leadworts or plumbagos plants with flowers that resemble this colour the term black lead usually refers to a powdered or processed graphite matte black in color abraham gottlob werner coined the name graphite writing stone in 1789 he attempted to clear up the confusion between molybdena plumbago and black lead after carl wilhelm scheele in 1778 proved that there are at least three different minerals scheele s analysis showed that the chemical compounds molybdenum sulfide molybdenite lead ii sulfide galena and graphite were three different soft black minerals 30 31 32 uses of natural graphite edit natural graphite is mostly consumed for refractories batteries steelmaking expanded graphite brake linings foundry facings and lubricants 10 graphene which occurs naturally in graphite has unique physical properties and is among the strongest substances known however the process of separating it from graphite will require more technological development refractories edit the use of graphite as a refractory material began before 1900 with the graphite crucible used to hold molten metal this is now a minor part of refractories in the mid-1980s the carbon-magnesite brick became important and a bit later the alumina-graphite shape as of 2017 the order of importance is alumina-graphite shapes carbon-magnesite brick monolithics gunning and ramming mixes and then crucibles crucibles began using very large flake graphite and carbon-magnesite brick requiring not quite so large flake graphite for these and others there is now much more flexibility in size of flake required and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories alumina-graphite shapes are used as continuous casting ware such as nozzles and troughs to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold and carbon magnesite bricks line steel converters and electric-arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures graphite blocks are also used in parts of blast furnace linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical high-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite bricks the us and european refractories industry had a crisis in 2000 2003 with an indifferent market for steel and a declining refractory consumption per tonne of steel underlying firm buyouts and many plant closures citation needed many of the plant closures resulted from the acquisition of harbison-walker refractories by rhi ag and some plants had their equipment auctioned off since much of the lost capacity was for carbon-magnesite brick graphite consumption within the refractories area moved towards alumina-graphite shapes and monolithics and away from brick the major source of carbon-magnesite brick is now imports from china almost all of the above refractories are used to make steel and account for 75 of refractory consumption the rest is used by a variety of industries such as cement according to the usgs us natural graphite consumption in refractories comprised 12,500 tonnes in 2010 10 batteries edit the use of graphite in batteries has been increasing in the last 30 years natural and synthetic graphite are used to construct the anode of all major battery technologies 10 the lithium-ion battery utilizes roughly twice the amount of graphite than lithium carbonate 33 the demand for batteries primarily nickel-metal-hydride and lithium-ion batteries has caused a growth in graphite demand in the late 1980s and early 1990s this growth was driven by portable electronics such as portable cd players and power tools laptops mobile phones tablet and smartphone products have increased the demand for batteries electric vehicle batteries are anticipated to increase graphite demand as an example a lithium-ion battery in a fully electric nissan leaf contains nearly 40 kg of graphite steelmaking edit natural graphite in this end use mostly goes into carbon raising in molten steel although it can be used to lubricate the dies used to extrude hot steel supplying carbon raisers is very competitive therefore subject to cut-throat pricing from alternatives such as synthetic graphite powder petroleum coke and other forms of carbon a carbon raiser is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to the specified level an estimate based on usgs us graphite consumption statistics indicates that 10,500 tonnes were used in this fashion in 2005 10 brake linings edit natural amorphous and fine flake graphite are used in brake linings or brake shoes for heavier nonautomotive vehicles and became important with the need to substitute for asbestos this use has been important for quite some time but nonasbestos organic nao compositions are beginning to reduce graphite s market share a brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial nor has an indifferent automotive market according to the usgs us natural graphite consumption in brake linings was 6,510 tonnes in 2005 10 foundry facings and lubricants edit a foundry facing mold wash is a water-based paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite painting the inside of a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures as forging die lubricant an antiseize agent a gear lubricant for mining machinery and to lubricate locks having low-grit graphite or even better no-grit graphite ultra high purity is highly desirable it can be used as a dry powder in water or oil or as colloidal graphite a permanent suspension in a liquid an estimate based on usgs graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes was used in this fashion in 2005 10 pencils edit graphite pencils the ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name given in 1789 by german mineralogist abraham gottlob werner it stems from graphein meaning to write draw in ancient greek 7 34 from the 16th century all pencils were made with leads of english natural graphite but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay it was invented by nicolas-jacques cont in 1795 35 36 it is chemically unrelated to the metal lead whose ores had a similar appearance hence the continuation of the name plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing typically as a lump of the mineral without a wood casing the term plumbago drawing is normally restricted to 17th and 18th century works mostly portraits today pencils are still a small but significant market for natural graphite around 7 of the 1.1 million tonnes produced in 2011 was used to make pencils 33 low-quality amorphous graphite is used and sourced mainly from china 10 other uses edit natural graphite has found uses in zinc-carbon batteries in electric motor brushes and various specialized applications graphite of various hardness or softness results in different qualities and tones when used as an artistic medium 37 railroads would often mix powdered graphite with waste oil or linseed oil to create a heat-resistant protective coating for the exposed portions of a steam locomotive s boiler such as the smokebox or lower part of the firebox 38 expanded graphite edit expanded graphite is made by immersing natural flake graphite in a bath of chromic acid then concentrated sulfuric acid which forces the crystal lattice planes apart thus expanding the graphite the expanded graphite can be used to make graphite foil or used directly as hot top compound to insulate molten metal in a ladle or red-hot steel ingots and decrease heat loss or as firestops fitted around a fire door or in sheet metal collars surrounding plastic pipe during a fire the graphite expands and chars to resist fire penetration and spread or to make high-performance gasket material for high-temperature use after being made into graphite foil the foil is machined and assembled into the bipolar plates in fuel cells the foil is made into heat sinks for laptop computers which keeps them cool while saving weight and is made into a foil laminate that can be used in valve packings or made into gaskets old-style packings are now a minor member of this grouping fine flake graphite in oils or greases for uses requiring heat resistance a gan estimate of current us natural graphite consumption in this end use is 7,500 tonnes 10 intercalated graphite edit structure of cac 6 graphite forms intercalation compounds with some metals and small molecules in these compounds the host molecule or atom gets sandwiched between the graphite layers resulting in a type of compounds with variable stoichiometry a prominent example of an intercalation compound is potassium graphite denoted by the formula kc8 graphite intercalation compounds are superconductors the highest transition temperature by june 2009 tc 11.5 k is achieved in cac6 and it further increases under applied pressure 15.1 k at 8 gpa 39 uses of synthetic graphite edit invention of a process to produce synthetic graphite edit in 1893 charles street of le carbone discovered a process for making artificial graphite another process to make synthetic graphite was invented accidentally by edward goodrich acheson 1856 1931 in the mid-1890s acheson discovered that overheating carborundum produced almost pure graphite while studying the effects of high temperature on carborundum he had found that silicon vaporizes at about 4,150 c 7,500 f leaving the carbon behind in graphitic carbon this graphite was another major discovery for him and it became extremely valuable and helpful as a lubricant 7 in 1896 acheson received a patent for his method of synthesizing graphite 40 and in 1897 started commercial production 7 the acheson graphite co was formed in 1899 scientific research edit highly oriented pyrolytic graphite hopg is the highest-quality synthetic form of graphite it is used in scientific research in particular as a length standard for scanner calibration of scanning probe microscope 41 electrodes edit graphite electrodes carry the electricity that melts scrap iron and steel and sometimes direct-reduced iron dri in electric arc furnaces which are the vast majority of steel furnaces they are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal tar pitch they are then extruded and shaped baked to carbonize the binder pitch and finally graphitized by heating it to temperatures approaching 3000 c at which the carbon atoms arrange into graphite they can vary in size up to 11 feet long and 30 inches in diameter an increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces and the electric arc furnace itself is getting more efficient making more steel per tonne of electrode an estimate based on usgs data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was 197,000 tonnes in 2005 10 electrolytic aluminium smelting also uses graphitic carbon electrodes on a much smaller scale synthetic graphite electrodes are used in electrical discharge machining edm commonly to make injection molds for plastics 42 powder and scrap edit the powder is made by heating powdered petroleum coke above the temperature of graphitization sometimes with minor modifications the graphite scrap comes from pieces of unusable electrode material in the manufacturing stage or after use and lathe turnings usually after crushing and sizing most synthetic graphite powder goes to carbon raising in steel competing with natural graphite with some used in batteries and brake linings according to the usgs us synthetic graphite powder and scrap production was 95,000 tonnes in 2001 latest data 10 neutron moderator edit special grades of synthetic graphite such as gilsocarbon 43 also find use as a matrix and neutron moderator within nuclear reactors its low neutron cross-section also recommends it for use in proposed fusion reactors care must be taken that reactor-grade graphite is free of neutron absorbing materials such as boron widely used as the seed electrode in commercial graphite deposition systems this caused the failure of the germans world war ii graphite-based nuclear reactors since they could not isolate the difficulty they were forced to use far more expensive heavy water moderators graphite used for nuclear reactors is often referred to as nuclear graphite other uses edit graphite carbon fiber and carbon nanotubes are also used in carbon fiber reinforced plastics and in heat-resistant composites such as reinforced carbon-carbon rcc commercial structures made from carbon fiber graphite composites include fishing rods golf club shafts bicycle frames sports car body panels the fuselage of the boeing 787 dreamliner and pool cue sticks and have been successfully employed in reinforced concrete the mechanical properties of carbon fiber graphite-reinforced plastic composites and grey cast iron are strongly influenced by the role of graphite in these materials in this context the term 100 graphite is often loosely used to refer to a pure mixture of carbon reinforcement and resin while the term composite is used for composite materials with additional ingredients 44 modern smokeless powder is coated in graphite to prevent the buildup of static charge graphite has been used in at least three radar absorbent materials it was mixed with rubber in sumpf and schornsteinfeger which were used on u-boat snorkels to reduce their radar cross section it was also used in tiles on early f-117 nighthawk 1983 s graphite mining beneficiation and milling edit large graphite specimen naturalis biodiversity center graphite is mined by both open pit and underground methods graphite usually needs beneficiation this may be carried out by hand-picking the pieces of gangue rock and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and marks coats the particles of gangue this makes the marked gangue particles float off with the graphite yielding impure concentrate there are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product repeated regrinding and floating up to seven times to purify the concentrate or by acid leaching dissolving the gangue with hydrofluoric acid for a silicate gangue or hydrochloric acid for a carbonate gangue in milling the incoming graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified sized or screened with the coarser flake size fractions below 8 mesh 8 20 mesh 20 50 mesh carefully preserved and then the carbon contents are determined some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content if flake size is unimportant the concentrate can be ground more freely typical end products include a fine powder for use as a slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds carbon raiser in the steel industry synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil occupational safety edit people can be exposed to graphite in the workplace by breathing it in skin contact and eye contact united states edit the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for graphite exposure in the workplace as a time weighted average twa of 15 million particles per cubic foot 1.5 mg m3 over an 8-hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of twa 2.5 mg m3 respirable dust over an 8-hour workday at levels of 1250 mg m3 graphite is immediately dangerous to life and health 45 graphite recycling edit the most common way of recycling graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded or the electrode or other are used all the way down to the electrode holder a new electrode replaces the old one but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains this is crushed and sized and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled but often not because of their graphite the largest-volume items such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15 25 graphite usually contain too little graphite however some recycled carbon-magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace-repair materials and also crushed carbon-magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners while crucibles have a high graphite content the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small a high-quality flake graphite product that closely resembles natural flake graphite can be made from steelmaking kish kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic oxygen furnace and consists of a mix of graphite precipitated out of the supersaturated iron lime-rich slag and some iron the iron is recycled on site leaving a mixture of graphite and slag the best recovery process uses hydraulic classification which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity graphite is light and settles nearly last to get a 70 graphite rough concentrate leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95 graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down see also edit acheson process carbon fiber carbon nanotube diamond exfoliated graphite nano-platelets
