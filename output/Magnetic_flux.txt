articles description edit the magnetic flux through a surface when the magnetic field is variable relies on splitting the surface into small surface elements over which the magnetic field can be considered to be locally constant the total flux is then a formal summation of these surface elements see surface integration each point on a surface is associated with a direction called the surface normal the magnetic flux through a point is then the component of the magnetic field along this direction the magnetic interaction is described in terms of a vector field where each point in space and time is associated with a vector that determines what force a moving charge would experience at that point see lorentz force 1 since a vector field is quite difficult to visualize at first in elementary physics one may instead visualize this field with field lines the magnetic flux through some surface in this simplified picture is proportional to the number of field lines passing through that surface in some contexts the flux may be defined to be precisely the number of field lines passing through that surface although technically misleading this distinction is not important note that the magnetic flux is the net number of field lines passing through that surface that is the number passing through in one direction minus the number passing through in the other direction see below for deciding in which direction the field lines carry a positive sign and in which they carry a negative sign 2 in more advanced physics the field line analogy is dropped and the magnetic flux is properly defined as the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field passing through a surface if the magnetic field is constant the magnetic flux passing through a surface of vector area s is b b s b s cos displaystyle phi b mathbf b cdot mathbf s bs cos theta where b is the magnitude of the magnetic field the magnetic flux density having the unit of wb m2 tesla s is the area of the surface and is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the normal perpendicular to s for a varying magnetic field we first consider the magnetic flux through an infinitesimal area element

which is denoted s magnetic flux through a closed surface edit some examples of closed surfaces left and open surfaces right left surface of a sphere surface of a torus surface of a cube right disk surface square surface surface of a hemisphere the surface is blue the boundary is red gauss s law for magnetism which is one of the four maxwell s equations states that the total magnetic flux through a closed surface is equal to zero a closed surface is a surface that completely encloses a volume s with no holes this law is a consequence of the empirical observation that magnetic monopoles have never been found in other words gauss s law for magnetism is the statement b displaystyle phi b s displaystyle scriptstyle s b d s 0 displaystyle mathbf b cdot d mathbf s 0 for any closed surface s magnetic flux through an open surface edit for an open surface the electromotive force along the surface boundary is a combination of the boundary s motion with velocity v through a magnetic field b illustrated by the generic f field in the diagram and the induced electric field caused by the changing magnetic field while the magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero the magnetic flux through an open surface need not be zero and is an important quantity in electromagnetism citation needed changing magnetic flux edit for example a change in the magnetic flux passing through a loop of conductive wire will cause an electromotive force and therefore an electric current in the loop the relationship is given by faraday s law e e v b d d b d t displaystyle mathcal e oint partial sigma left mathbf e mathbf v times b right cdot d boldsymbol ell - d phi b over dt where e displaystyle mathcal e is the electromotive force emf b is the magnetic flux through the open surface is the boundary of the open surface note that the surface in general may be in motion and deforming and so is generally a function of time the electromotive force is induced along this boundary d is an infinitesimal vector element of the contour v is the velocity of the boundary e is the electric field b is the magnetic field the two equations for the emf are firstly the work per unit charge done against the lorentz force in moving a test charge around the possibly moving surface boundary and secondly as the change of magnetic flux through the open surface this equation is the principle behind an electrical generator area defined by an electric coil with three turns comparison with electric flux edit by way of contrast gauss s law for electric fields another of maxwell s equations is e
