officer in the massachusetts militia and a member of a prominent landowning family his will included a bequest to support and maintain a free school to be established in the town of west hoosac massachusetts provided the town change its name to williamstown williams was killed at the battle of lake george on september 8 1755 11 after shays rebellion the williamstown free school opened with 15 students on october 26 1791 the first president was ebenezer fitch not long after its founding the school s trustees petitioned the massachusetts legislature to convert the free school to a tuition-based college the legislature agreed and on june 22 1793 williams college was chartered it was the second college to be founded in massachusetts depiction of west college which composed the entire college in its early years at its founding the college maintained a policy of racial segregation refusing admission to black applicants this policy was challenged by lucy terry prince who is credited as the first black american poet 12 when her son festus was refused admission on account of his race 13 prince who had established a reputation as a raconteur 14 and rhetorician delivered a three-hour speech before the college s board of trustees quoting abundantly from scripture but was unable to secure her son s admission 13 more recent scholarship however has highlighted there are no records within the college to confirm this event occurred and festus prince may have been refused entry for an insufficient mastery of latin greek and french all of which were necessary for successful completion of the entrance exam at the time and which would most likely not have been available in the local schools of guilford vermont where festus was raised 15 in 1806 a student prayer meeting gave rise to the american foreign mission movement in august of that year five students met in the maple grove of sloan s meadow to pray a thunderstorm drove them to the shelter of a haystack and the fervor of the ensuing meeting inspired them to take the gospel abroad the students went on to build the american board of commissioners for foreign missions the first american organization to send

him and re-founded the college under the name of amherst college some students and professors decided to stay at williams and were allowed to keep the land which was at the time relatively worthless

succeeded by heman humphrey a trustee of williams college 16 edward dorr griffin was appointed president of williams and is widely credited with saving williams during his 15-year tenure a williams
