systems it was first published by russian german climatologist wladimir k ppen in 1884 2 3 with several later modifications by k ppen notably in 1918 and 1936 4 5 later german climatologist rudolf geiger 1954 1961 collaborated with k ppen on changes to the classification system which is thus sometimes called the k ppen geiger climate classification system 6 7 the k ppen climate classification system has been further modified within the trewartha climate classification system in the middle 1960s revised in 1980 the trewartha system sought to create a more refined middle latitude climate zone which was one of the criticisms of the k ppen system the c climate group was too broad 8 200 1 contents 1 meaning of symbols 2 scheme 2.1 group a tropical megathermal climates 2.1.1 tropical

latitudes unlike the dry summer mediterranean climates humid subtropical climates have a warm and wet flow from the tropics that creates warm and moist conditions in the summer months as such summer not winter as is the case in mediterranean climates is often the wettest season the flow out of the subtropical highs and the summer monsoon creates a southerly flow from the tropics that brings warm and moist air to the lower east sides of continents this flow is often what brings the frequent but short-lived summer thundershowers so typical of the more southerly subtropical climates like the far

40 and 60 they are typically situated immediately poleward of the mediterranean climates although in australia and extreme southern africa this climate is found immediately poleward of temperate climates and at a somewhat lower latitude in western europe this climate occurs in coastal areas up to 63 n in norway these climates are dominated all year round by the polar front leading to changeable often overcast weather summers are cool due to cool ocean currents but winters are milder than other climates in similar latitudes but usually very cloudy cfb climates are also encountered at high elevations in certain subtropical and tropical areas where the climate would be that of a subtropical tropical rain forest if not for the altitude these climates are called highlands 8 226 9

the warmest temperature of any month is below 10 c 50 f polar climates are further divided into two types tundra climates and icecap climates tundra climate et and etf warmest month has an average temperature between 0 and 10 c these climates occur on the northern edges of the north american and eurasian land masses generally north of 70 n although it may be found farther south depending on local conditions and on nearby islands et climates are also found on some islands near the antarctic convergence and at high elevations outside the polar regions above the tree line examples mount

climates distinguishing between etf ets and etw if either the summer or winter is clearly drier than the other half of the year when the option to include this letter is exercised the same standards that are used for groups c and d apply with the additional requirement that the wettest month must have an average of at least 30 mm precipitation group e climates can be as dry or even drier than group b climates based on actual precipitation received but their rate of evaporation is much lower seasonal precipitation letters are almost never attached to ef climates mainly due to the difficulty in distinguishing between falling and blowing snow as snow is the sole source of moisture in these climates citation needed ecological significance edit the k ppen climate classification is based on the empirical relationship between climate and vegetation this classification provides an efficient way to describe climatic conditions defined by temperature and precipitation and their seasonality with a single metric because climatic conditions identified by the k ppen classification are ecologically relevant it has been widely used to map geographic distribution of long term climate and associated ecosystem conditions 17 over the recent years there has been an increasing interest in using the classification to identify changes in climate and potential changes in vegetation over time 11 the most important ecological significance of the k ppen climate classification is that it helps to predict the dominant vegetation type based on the climatic data and vice versa 18 in 2015 a nanjing university paper published in nature analyzing climate classifications found that between 1950 and 2010 approximately 5.7 of all land area worldwide had moved from wetter and colder classifications to drier and hotter classifications the authors also found that the change cannot be explained as natural variations but are driven by anthropogenic factors 19 trewartha climate classification scheme edit the trewartha climate classification is a climate classification system published by american geographer glenn thomas trewartha in 1966 and updated in 1980 it is a modified version of the 1899 k ppen system created to answer some of the deficiencies of the k ppen system the trewartha system attempts to redefine the middle latitudes to be closer to vegetation zoning and genetic climate systems it was considered a more true or real world reflection of the global climate citation needed for example under the standard k ppen system in the united states western washington and oregon are classed into the same climate zone as southern california even though the two regions have strikingly different weather and vegetation under the old k ppen system cool oceanic climates like that of london or seattle were classed in the same zone as hot subtropical cities like savannah ga or brisbane australia in the united states locations like colorado and iowa which have long severe winter climates where plants are completely dormant were classed into the same climate zone as louisiana or northern florida which have mild winters and a green winter landscape other k ppen climate maps edit all maps use the 0 c definition for temperate climates and the 18 c annual mean temperature threshold to distinguish between hot and cold dry climates 1 north america
