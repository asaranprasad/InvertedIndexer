ampere electric current k kelvin temperature s second time m metre length kg kilogram mass cd candela luminous intensity mol mole amount of substance the international system of units si abbreviated from the french syst me international d unit s is the modern form of the metric system and is the most widely used system of measurement it comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units ampere kelvin second metre kilogram candela mole and a set of twenty decimal prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units the system also specifies names for 22 derived units for other common physical quantities like lumen watt etc the base units except for one are derived from invariant constants of nature such as the speed of light and the triple point of water which can be observed and measured with great accuracy the kilogram standard of mass is a physical artefact certified in 1889 consisting of a cylinder of platinum-iridium which nominally has the same mass weight as one litre of water at the freezing point its stability has been a matter of significant concern resulting in recent proposals to change the definition to one derived from invariant constant of nature 1 derived units may be defined in terms of base units or other derived units they are adopted to facilitate measurement in diverse fields of endeavor the si is intended to be an evolving system units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves the last new derived unit was defined in 1999 the reliability of the si depends not only on the precise measurement of standards for the base units in terms of various physical constants of nature but also on precise definition of those constants the set of underlying constants is modified as more stable constants are found or other constants may be more precisely measured for example in 1983 the metre was redefined to be the distance of light propagation in vacuum in an exact fraction of a second thus the speed of light is now an exactly defined constant of nature the motivation for the development of the si was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the centimetre gram second cgs systems specifically the inconsistency between the systems of electrostatic units and electromagnetic units and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them the general conference on weights and measures french conf rence g n rale des poids et mesures cgpm which was established by the metre convention of 1875 brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements the system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948 it is based on the metre kilogram second system of units mks rather than any variant of the cgs since then the si has been adopted by all countries except the united states liberia and burma 2 contents 1 units and prefixes

external links units and prefixes edit the international system of units consists of a set of base units a set of coherent derived units and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as prefixes 3 103 106 coherent units are derived units that contain no numerical factor other than 1 quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions for example 1 n 1 kg 1 m s2 which says that one newton is the force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram at one metre per second squared since the si units of mass and acceleration are kilogram and metre per second squared respectively and f m a the units of force and hence of newtons is formed by multiplication to give 1 kg m s 2 since the newton is part of a coherent set of units the constant of proportionality is 1 while the base and specified derived units are coherent they are not all independent for example siemens can be specified in terms of ohms as its inverse ohms and siemens can be replaced with a combination of amperes and volts because those quantities bear a defined relationship to each other 4 other useful derived quantities can be specified in terms of the si base and derived units that have no named units in the si system such as acceleration which is defined in si units as m s2 base units edit the si base units are the building blocks of the system and all the other units are derived from them when maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system he identified three quantities that could be used as base units mass length and time giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit for which the unit of electric current was chosen for si another three base units for temperature substance and luminous intensity were added later si

the late 19th century called a candlepower or a candle notes interim definitions are given here only when there has been a significant difference in the definition despite the prefix kilo- the kilogram is the base unit of mass the kilogram not the gram is used in the definitions of derived units nonetheless units of mass are named as if the gram were the base unit in 1954 the unit of thermodynamic temperature was known as the degree kelvin symbol k kelvin spelt with an upper-case k it was renamed the kelvin symbol k kelvin spelt with a lower case k in 1967 when the mole is used the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms molecules ions electrons other particles or specified groups of such particles the prior definitions of the various base units in the above table were made by the following authorities fg french government iec international electrotechnical commission icaw international committee on atomic weights all other definitions result from resolutions by either cgpm or the cipm and are catalogued in the si brochure the early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit while the si defines an analogous unit of mass in everyday use these are mostly interchangeable but in scientific contexts the difference matters mass strictly the inertial mass represents a quantity of matter it relates the acceleration of a body to the applied force via newton s law f m a force equals mass times acceleration in si units if you apply a force of 1 n newton to a mass of 1 kg it will accelerate at 1 m s2 this is true whether the object is floating in space or in a gravity field e g at the earth s surface weight is the force exerted on a body by a gravitational field and hence its weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field weight of a 1 kg mass at the earth s surface is m g mass times the acceleration due to gravity which at the earth s surface is 9.81 newtons and at the surface of mars is about 3.5 newtons weight is not an accurate base unit for precision measurement because the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies over the surface of the earth since the earth does not have uniform density or radius in all directions it also varies with altitude or depth distance from earth s centre derived units edit the derived units in the si are formed by powers products or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number 3 103 5 3 derived units are associated with derived quantities for example velocity is a quantity that is derived from the base quantities of time and length and thus the si derived unit is metre per second symbol m s the dimensions of derived units can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units combinations of base and derived units may be used to express other derived units for example the si unit of force is the newton n the si unit of pressure is the pascal pa and the pascal can be defined as one newton per square metre n m2 11 named si derived

prefixes edit prefixes are added to unit names to produce multiples and sub-multiples of the original unit all multiples are integer powers of ten and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand for example kilo- denotes a multiple of a thousand and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre the prefixes are never combined so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre not a millimillimetre multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram not a microkilogram 3 122 12 14 v t standard prefixes for the si units of measure multiples prefix name deca hecto kilo mega giga tera peta exa zetta yotta

discuss proposed since december 2017 the si is capable of describing most useful and measurable physical quantities citation needed but many non-si units still appear in the scientific technical and commercial literature some units are deeply embedded in history and culture the cipm recognised and acknowledged such traditions by compiling a list of non-si units accepted for use with si which are grouped as follows 3 123 129 12 7 11 note 1 the litre is classed as a non-si unit accepted for use with the si being one thousandth of a cubic metre the litre is not a coherent unit of measure with respect to si non-si units accepted for use with the si certain units of time angle and legacy non-si metric units have a long history of consistent use most societies have used the solar day and its non-decimal subdivisions as a basis of time and unlike the foot or the pound these were the same regardless of where they were being measured the radian being 1 2 of a revolution has mathematical advantages but it is cumbersome for navigation and as with time the units used in navigation have a large degree of consistency around the world the tonne litre and hectare were adopted by the cgpm in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside si units having been given unique symbols the catalogued units are minute hour day degree of arc minute of arc second of arc hectare litre tonne astronomical unit and deci bel non-si units whose values in si units must be obtained experimentally table 7 physicists often use units of measure that are based on natural phenomena particularly when the quantities associated with these phenomena are many orders of magnitude greater than or less than the equivalent si unit the most common ones have been catalogued in the si brochure together with consistent symbols and accepted values but with the caveat that their values in si units need to be measured electronvolt symbol ev and dalton unified atomic mass unit da or u

non-si units that had never been formally sanctioned by the cgpm have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including health care and navigation as with the units of measure in tables 6 and 7 these have been catalogued by the cipm in the si brochure to ensure consistent usage but with the recommendation that authors who use them should define them wherever they are used bar millimetre of mercury ngstr m nautical mile barn knot and neper in the interests of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry the 12th cgpm 1964 accepted the continued use of the curie symbol ci as a non-si unit of activity for radionuclides 3 152 the becquerel sievert and gray were adopted in later years similarly the millimetre of mercury symbol mmhg was retained for measuring blood pressure 3 127 non-si units associated with the cgs and the cgs-gaussian system of units table 9 the si manual also catalogues a number of legacy units of measure that are used in specific fields such as geodesy and geophysics or are found in the literature particularly in classical and relativistic electrodynamics where they have certain advantages the units that are catalogued are erg dyne poise stokes stilb phot gal maxwell gauss and oersted common notions of the metric units edit the basic units of the metric system as originally defined represented common quantities or relationships in nature they still do the modern precisely defined quantities are refinements of definition and methodology but still with the same magnitudes in cases where laboratory precision may not be required or available or where approximations are good enough the original definitions may suffice 13 a second is 1 60 of a minute which is 1 60 of an hour which is 1 24 of a day so a second is 1 86400 of a day a second is the time it takes a dense object to freely fall 4.9 metres from rest the metre is close to the length of a pendulum that has a period of 2 seconds most dining tabletops are about 0.75 metre high a very tall human basketball forward is about 2 metres tall the kilogram is the weight of a litre of cold water a cubic centimetre or millilitre of water

intensity of a moderately bright candle or 1 candle power a 60 w tungsten-filament incandescent light bulb has a luminous intensity of about 64 candela a mole of a substance has a mass that is its molecular weight expressed in units of grams the mass of a mole of table salt is 58.4 g a temperature difference of one kelvin is the same as one degree centigrade 1 100 of the temperature differential between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level the absolute temperature in kelvins is the temperature in degrees celsius plus about 273 human body temperature is about 37 c or 310 k a 60 w incandescent light bulb consumes 0.5 amperes at 120 v us mains voltage and about 0.26 amperes at 230 v european mains voltage lexicographic conventions edit unit names edit names of units follow the grammatical rules associated with common nouns in english and in french they start with a lowercase letter e g newton hertz pascal even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter this also applies to degrees celsius since degree is the unit 14 15 the official british and american spellings for certain si units differ british english as well as australian canadian and new zealand english uses the spelling deca- metre and litre whereas american english uses the spelling deka- meter and liter respectively 5 3 unit symbols and the values of quantities edit although the writing of unit names is language-specific the writing of unit symbols and the values of quantities is consistent across all languages and therefore the si brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them 3 130 135 the guideline produced by the national institute of standards and technology nist 16 clarifies language-specific areas in respect of american english that were left open by the si brochure but is otherwise identical to the si brochure 17 general rules edit general rules note 2 for writing si units and quantities apply to text that is either handwritten or produced using an automated process the value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space representing a multiplication sign and a unit symbol e g 2.21 kg 7002730000000000000 7.3 102 m2 22 k this rule explicitly includes the percent sign 3 134 and the symbol for degrees of temperature c 3 133 exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees minutes and seconds and which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space symbols are mathematical entities not abbreviations and as such do not have an appended period full stop unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason such as denoting the end of a sentence a prefix is part of the unit and its symbol is prepended to the unit symbol without a separator e g k in km m in mpa g in ghz compound prefixes are not allowed symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a centre dot or a non-breaking space e g n m or n m symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a solidus or given as a negative exponent e g the metre per second can be written m s m s 1 m s 1 or m s only one solidus should be used e g kg m s2 and kg m 1 s 2 are acceptable but kg m s2 is ambiguous and unacceptable acceleration due to gravity the lowercase letters neither metres nor seconds were named after people the space between the value and the units and the superscript 2 to denote squared the first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in upper case otherwise they are written in lower case e g the unit of pressure is named after blaise pascal so its symbol is written pa but the symbol for mole is written mol thus t is the symbol for tesla a measure of magnetic field strength and t the symbol for tonne a measure of mass since 1979 the litre may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase l or a lowercase l a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter l to the numeral 1 especially with certain typefaces or english-style handwriting the american nist recommends that within the united states l be used rather than l symbols of units do not have a plural form e g 25 kg not 25 kgs uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable e g the quantities 1 mw and 1 mw represent two different quantities the former is the typical power requirement of a hearing aid 1 milliwatt or 0.001 watts and the latter the typical power requirement of a suburban train 1 megawatt or 7006100000000000000 1000000 watts the symbol for the decimal marker is either a point or comma on the line in practice the decimal point is used in most english-speaking countries and most of asia and the comma in most of latin america and in continental european countries 18 spaces should be used as a thousands separator 7006100000000000000 1000000 in contrast to commas or periods 1,000,000 or 1.000.000 to reduce confusion resulting from the variation between these forms in different countries any line-break inside a number inside a compound unit or between number and unit should be avoided where this is not possible line breaks should coincide with thousands separators since the value of billion and trillion can vary from language to language the dimensionless terms ppb parts per billion and ppt parts per trillion should be avoided no alternative is suggested in the si brochure printing si symbols edit the rules covering printing of quantities and units are part of iso 80000-1 2009 19 further rules note 2 are specified in respect of production of text using printing presses word processors typewriters and the like international system of quantities edit si brochure cover of brochure the cgpm publishes a brochure which defines and presents the si 3 its official version is in french in line with the metre convention 3 102 it leaves some scope for local interpretation particularly regarding names and terms in different languages 20 5 the writing and maintenance of the cgpm brochure is carried out by one of the committees of the international committee for weights and measures cipm the definitions of the terms quantity unit dimension etc that are used in the si brochure are those given in the international vocabulary of metrology 21 the quantities and equations that define the si units are now referred to as the international system of quantities isq the system is based on the quantities underlying each of the seven base units of the si other quantities such as area pressure and electrical resistance are derived from these base quantities by clear non-contradictory equations the isq defines the quantities that are measured with the si units 22 the isq is defined in the international standard iso iec 80000 and was finalised in 2009 with the publication of iso 80000-1 23 realisation of units edit silicon sphere for the avogadro project used for measuring the avogadro constant to a relative standard uncertainty of 6992200000000000000 2 10 8 or less held by achim leistner 24 metrologists carefully distinguish between the definition of a unit and its realisation the definition of each base unit of the si is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made the realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit a description of the mise en pratique note 3 of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the si brochure 25 3 168 169 the published mise en pratique is not the only way in which a base unit can be determined the si brochure states that any method consistent with the laws of physics could be used to realise any si unit 3 111 in the current 2016 exercise to overhaul the definitions of the base units various consultative committees of the cipm have required that more than one mise en pratique shall be developed for determining the value of each unit citation needed in particular at least three separate experiments be carried out yielding values having a relative standard uncertainty in the determination of the kilogram of no more than 6992500000000000000 5 10 8 and at least one of these values should be better than 6992200000000000000 2 10 8 both the watt balance and the avogadro project should be included in the experiments and any differences between these be reconciled 26 27 when the kelvin is being determined the relative uncertainty of the boltzmann constant

corroborated by other measurements 28 evolution of the si edit changes to the si edit the bipm has described si as the modern metric system 3 95 changing technology has led to an evolution of the definitions and standards that has followed two principal strands changes to si itself and clarification of how to use units of measure that are not part of si but are still nevertheless used on a worldwide basis since 1960 the cgpm has made a number of changes to the si to meet the needs of specific fields notably chemistry and radiometry these are mostly additions to the list of named derived units and include the mole symbol mol for an amount of substance the pascal symbol pa for pressure the siemens symbol s for electrical conductance the becquerel symbol bq for activity referred to a radionuclide the gray symbol gy for ionizing radiation the sievert symbol sv as the unit of dose equivalent radiation and the katal symbol kat for catalytic activity 3 156 29 3 156 3 158 3 159 3 165 acknowledging the advancement of precision science at both large and small scales the range of defined prefixes pico- 10 12 to tera- 1012 was extended to 10 24 to 1024 3 152 3 158 3 164 the 1960

299792458 second so that the speed of light is now an exactly specified constant of nature a few changes to notation conventions were also made to alleviate lexicographic ambiguities proposed redefinitions edit dependencies of proposed si unit definitions in colour and seven physical constants in grey with fixed numerical values unlike the current 2014 definition the base units are derived from one or more constants of nature after the metre was redefined in 1960 the kilogram remained the only si base unit that relied on a specific physical artefact the international prototype of the kilogram ipk for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the ipk 30 during the 2nd and 3rd periodic verification of national prototypes of the kilogram a significant divergence in weight between the ipk and all of its official copies stored around the world had occurred the copies had all noticeably gained weight with respect to the ipk during extraordinary verifications carried out in 2014 preparatory to redefinition of metric standards continuing divergence was not confirmed nonetheless the residual and irreducible instability of a physical ipk undermines the reliability of the entire metric system to precision measurement from small atomic to large astrophysical scales the existing proposal is in addition to the speed of light four constants of nature the planck constant an elementary charge the boltzmann constant and the avogadro number be defined to have exact values the international prototype kilogram be retired the current definitions of the kilogram ampere kelvin and mole be revised the wording of base unit definitions should change emphasis from explicit unit to explicit constant definitions the redefinitions are expected to be adopted at the 26th cgpm in november 2018 31 the codata task group on fundamental constants has announced special submission deadlines for data to compute the values that will be announced at this event 32 history edit stone marking the austro-hungarian italian border at pontebba displaying myriametres a unit of 10 km used in central europe in the 19th century but since deprecated 33 the improvisation of units edit the units and unit magnitudes of the metric system which became the si were improvised piecemeal from everyday physical quantities starting in the mid-18th century only later were they moulded into an orthogonal coherent decimal system of measurement the degree centigrade as a unit of temperature resulted from the scale devised by swedish astronomer anders celsius in 1742 his scale counter-intuitively designated 100 as the freezing point of water and 0 as the boiling point independently in 1743 the french physicist jean-pierre christin described a scale with 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 the boiling point the scale became known as the centi-grade or 100 gradations of temperature scale the metric system was developed from 1791 onwards by a committee of the french academy of sciences commissioned to create a unified and rational system of measures 34 the group which included preeminent french men of science 35 89 used the same principles for relating length volume and mass that had been proposed by the english clergyman john wilkins in 1668 36 37 and the concept of using the earth s meridian as the basis of the definition of length originally proposed in 1670 by the french abbot mouton 38 39 carl friedrich gauss in march 1791 the assembly adopted the committee s proposed principles for the new decimal system of measure including the metre defined to be 1 10,000,000th of the length of the quadrant of earth s meridian passing through paris and authorised a survey to precisely establish the length of the meridian in july 1792 the committee proposed the names metre are litre and grave for the units of length area capacity and mass respectively the committee also proposed that multiples and submultiples of these units were to be denoted by decimal-based prefixes such as centi for a hundredth and kilo for a thousand 40 82 thomson maxwell william thomson lord kelvin and james clerk maxwell played a prominent role in the development of the principle of coherence and in the naming of many units of measure 41 42 43 44 45 later during the process of adoption of the metric system the latin gramme and kilogramme replaced the former provincial terms gravet 1 1000 grave and grave in june 1799 based on the results of the meridian survey the standard m tre des archives and kilogramme des archives were deposited in the french national archives subsequently that year the metric system was adopted by law in france 46 47 the french system was short-lived due to its unpopularity napoleon ridiculed it and in 1812 introduced a replacement system the mesures usuelles or customary measures which restored many of the old units but redefined in terms of the metric system during the first half of the 19th century there was little consistency in the choice of preferred multiples of the base units typically the myriametre 7004100000000000000 10000 metres was in widespread use in both france and parts of germany while the kilogram 7003100000000000000 1000 grams rather than the myriagram was used for mass 33 in 1832 the german mathematician carl friedrich gauss assisted by wilhelm weber implicitly defined the second as a base unit when he quoted the earth s magnetic field in terms of millimetres grams and seconds 41 prior to this the strength of the earth s magnetic field had only been described in relative terms the technique used by gauss was to equate the torque induced on a suspended magnet of known mass by the earth s magnetic field with the torque induced on an equivalent system under gravity the resultant calculations enabled him to assign dimensions based on mass length and time to the magnetic field 48 49 a candlepower as a unit of illuminance was originally defined by an 1860 english law as the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle weighing 1 6 pound 76 grams and burning at a specified rate spermaceti a waxy substance found in the heads of sperm whales was once used to make high-quality candles at this time the french standard of light was based upon the illumination from a carcel oil lamp the unit was defined as that illumination emanating from a lamp burning pure rapeseed oil at a defined rate it was accepted that ten standard candles were about equal to one carcel lamp metre convention edit cgpm vocabulary

realisation note 4 82 171 a french-inspired initiative for international cooperation in metrology led to the signing in 1875 of the metre convention also called treaty of the metre by 17 nations 50 35 353 354 initially the convention only covered standards for the metre and the kilogram in 1921 the metre convention was extended to include all physical units including the ampere and others thereby enabling the cgpm to address inconsistencies in the way that the metric system had been used 42 3 96 a set of 30 prototypes of the metre and 40 prototypes of the kilogram note 5 in each case made of a 90 platinum-10 iridium alloy were manufactured by british metallurgy specialty firm and accepted by the cgpm in 1889 one of each was selected at random to become the international prototype metre and international prototype kilogram that replaced the m tre des archives and kilogramme des archives respectively each member state was entitled to one of each of the remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that country 51 the treaty also established a number of international organisations to oversee the keeping of international standards of measurement 52 53 the cgs and mks systems edit closeup of the national prototype metre serial number 27 allocated to the united states in the 1860s james clerk maxwell william thomson later lord kelvin and others working under the auspices of the british association for the advancement of science built on gauss work and formalised the concept of a coherent system of units with base units and derived units christened the centimetre gram second system of units in 1874 the principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the cgs including the erg for energy the dyne for force the barye for pressure the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity 44 in 1879 the cipm published recommendations for writing the symbols for length area volume and mass but it was outside its domain to publish recommendations for other quantities beginning in about 1900 physicists who had been using the symbol mu for micrometre or micron lambda for microlitre and gamma for microgram started to use the symbols m l and g 54 at the close of the 19th century three different systems of units of measure existed for electrical measurements a cgs-based system for electrostatic units also known as the gaussian or esu system a cgs-based system for electromechanical units emu and an international system based on units defined by the metre convention 55 for electrical distribution systems attempts to resolve the electrical units in terms of length mass and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties the dimensions depended on whether one used the esu or emu systems 45 this anomaly was resolved in 1901 when giovanni giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units the fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current voltage or electrical resistance 56 electric current with named unit ampere was chosen as the base unit and the other electrical quantities derived from it according to the laws of physics this became the foundation of the mks system of units this section is missing information about all 22 named derived units of si please expand the section to

centimetre metre and second such as the pferdest rke metric horsepower for power 57 note 6 the darcy for permeability 58 and millimetres of mercury for barometric and blood pressure were developed or

communities and to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the metre convention 60 this working document was practical system of units of measurement based on this study the 10th cgpm in 1954 defined an international system derived from six base units including units of temperature and optical radiation in addition to those for the mks system mass length and time units and georgi s current unit six base units were recommended the metre kilogram second ampere degree kelvin and candela the 9th cgpm also approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known was laid down 61 these rules were subsequently extended and now cover unit symbols and names prefix symbols and names how quantity symbols should be written and used and how the values of quantities should be expressed 3 104,130 birth of the si edit this
