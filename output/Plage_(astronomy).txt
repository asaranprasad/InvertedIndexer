https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plage_(astronomy) plage astronomy from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a plage is a bright region in the chromosphere of the sun typically found in regions of the chromosphere near sunspots the term itself is poetically taken from the french word for beach the plage regions map closely to the bright spots faculae in the photosphere below but the latter have much smaller spatial scales accordingly plage occurs most visibly near a sunspot region faculae have a strong influence on the solar constant and the more readily detectable because chromospheric plage areas traditionally are used to monitor this influence in this context active network consists of plage-like brightenings extending away from active regions as their magnetism appears to diffuse into the quiet sun but constrained to follow the network boundaries because we can explain faculae with the strictly photospheric hot wall model 1 what the actual physical relationship between plage and faculae may be is not clear references edit topka k p tarbell t d title a m 1997 properties of the smallest solar magnetic elements ii observations versus hot wall models of faculae astrophysical journal 484 1 479 486 bibcode doi external links edit this article related to the sun is a stub you can help wikipedia by v t retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title plage astronomy oldid 730096598 categories stellar astronomy stellar phenomena sun solar phenomena sun stubs hidden categories all stub articles navigation menu search this page was last edited on 16 july 2016 at 17 29 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
