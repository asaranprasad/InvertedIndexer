notations ellipses examples in mathematics an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve as such it is a generalization of a circle which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location the shape of an ellipse how elongated it is is represented by its eccentricity which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 the limiting case of a circle to arbitrarily close to but less than 1 ellipses are the closed type of conic section a plane curve resulting from the intersection of a cone by a plane see figure to the right ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections parabolas and hyperbolas both of which are open and unbounded the cross section of a cylinder is an ellipse unless the section is parallel to the axis of the cylinder analytically an ellipse may also be defined as the set of points such that the ratio of the distance of each point on the curve from a given point called a focus or focal point to the distance from that same point on the curve to a given line called the directrix is a constant this ratio is called the eccentricity of the ellipse an ellipse may also be defined analytically as the set of points for each of which the sum of its distances to two foci is a fixed number ellipses are common in physics astronomy and engineering for example the orbit of each planet in our solar system is approximately an ellipse with the barycenter of the planet sun pair at one of the focal points the same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems having two astronomical bodies the shapes of planets and stars are often well described by ellipsoids ellipses also arise as images of a circle under parallel projection and the bounded cases of perspective projection which are simply intersections of the projective cone with the plane of projection it is also the simplest lissajous figure formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are sinusoids with the same frequency a similar effect leads to elliptical polarization of light in optics the name lleipsis omission was given

circles for details see ellipses in dg german so it is essential to have tools to draw an ellipse nowadays the best tool is the computer during the times before this tool was not available and one was restricted to compass and ruler for the construction of single points of an ellipse but there are technical tools ellipsographs to draw an ellipse in a continuous way like a compass for drawing a circle too the principle of ellipsographs were known to greek mathematicians archimedes proklos already if there is no ellipsograph available the best and quickest way to draw an ellipse is to draw an approximation by the four osculating circles at the vertices for any method described below the knowledge of the axes and the semi-axes is necessary or equivalent the foci and the semi-major axis if this presumption is not fulfilled one has to know at least two conjugate diameters with help of rytz s construction the axes and semi-axes can be retrieved ellipse gardener s method pins-and-string method edit the characterization of an ellipse as the locus of points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two drawing pins a length of string and a pencil in this method pins are pushed into the paper at two points which become the ellipse s foci a string tied at each end to the two pins and the tip of a pencil pulls the loop taut to form a triangle the tip of the pencil then traces an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut using two pegs and a rope gardeners use this procedure to outline an elliptical flower bed thus it is called the gardener s ellipse a similar method for drawing confocal ellipses with a closed string is due to the irish bishop charles graves paper strip methods edit the two following methods rely on

this is a consequence of the total travel length being the same along any wall-bouncing path between the two foci similarly if a light source is placed at one focus of an elliptic mirror all light rays on the plane of the ellipse are reflected to the second focus since no other smooth curve has such a property it can be used as an alternative definition of an ellipse in the special case of a circle with a source at its center all light would be reflected back to the center if the ellipse is rotated along its major axis to produce an ellipsoidal mirror specifically a prolate spheroid this property holds for all rays out of the source alternatively a cylindrical mirror with elliptical cross-section can be used to focus light from a linear fluorescent lamp along a line of the paper such mirrors are used in some document scanners sound waves are reflected in a similar way so in a large elliptical room a person standing at one focus can hear a person standing at the other focus

their orbits are similar ellipses with the common barycenter being one of the foci of each ellipse the other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance interestingly the orbit of either body in the reference frame of the other is also an ellipse with the other body at the same focus keplerian elliptical orbits are the result of any radially directed attraction force whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance thus in principle the motion of two oppositely charged particles in empty space would also be an ellipse however this conclusion ignores losses due to electromagnetic radiation and quantum effects which become significant when the particles are moving at high speed for elliptical orbits useful relations involving the

long pendulum that is free to move in two dimensions of a mass attached to a fixed point by a perfectly elastic spring or of any object that moves under influence of an attractive force that is directly proportional to its distance from a fixed attractor unlike keplerian orbits however these harmonic orbits have the center of attraction at the geometric center of the ellipse and have fairly simple equations of motion phase visualization edit in electronics the relative phase of two sinusoidal signals can be compared by feeding them to the vertical and horizontal inputs of an oscilloscope if the display is an ellipse rather than a straight line the two signals are out of phase elliptical gears edit two non-circular gears with the same elliptical outline each pivoting around one focus and positioned at the proper angle turn smoothly while maintaining contact at all times alternatively they can be connected by a link chain or timing belt or in the case of a bicycle the main chainring may be elliptical or an ovoid similar to an ellipse in form such elliptical gears may be used in mechanical equipment to produce variable angular speed or torque from a constant rotation of the driving axle or in the case of a bicycle to allow a varying crank rotation speed with inversely varying mechanical advantage elliptical bicycle gears make it easier for the chain to slide off the cog when changing gears 16 an example gear application would be a device that winds thread onto a conical bobbin on a spinning machine the bobbin would need to wind faster when the thread is near the apex than when it is near the base 17 optics edit in a material that is optically anisotropic birefringent the refractive index depends on the direction of the light the dependency can be described by an index ellipsoid if the material is optically isotropic this ellipsoid is a sphere in lamp-pumped solid-state lasers elliptical cylinder-shaped reflectors have been used to direct light from the pump lamp coaxial with one ellipse focal axis to the active medium rod coaxial with the second focal axis 18 in laser-plasma produced euv light sources used in microchip lithography euv light is generated by plasma positioned in the primary focus of an ellipsoid mirror and is collected in the secondary focus at the input of the lithography machine 19 statistics and finance edit in statistics a bivariate random vector x y is jointly elliptically distributed if its iso-density contours loci of equal values of the density function are ellipses the concept extends to an arbitrary number of elements of the random vector in which case in general the iso-density contours are ellipsoids a special case is the multivariate normal distribution the elliptical distributions are important in finance because if rates of return on assets are jointly elliptically distributed then all portfolios can be characterized completely by their mean and variance that is any two portfolios with identical mean and variance of portfolio return have identical distributions of portfolio return 20 21 computer graphics edit drawing an ellipse as a graphics primitive is common in standard display libraries such as the macintosh quickdraw api and direct2d on windows jack bresenham at ibm is most famous for the invention of 2d drawing primitives including line and circle drawing using only fast integer operations such as addition and branch on carry bit m l v pitteway extended bresenham s algorithm for lines to conics in 1967 22 another efficient generalization to draw ellipses was invented in 1984 by jerry van aken 23 in 1970 danny cohen presented at the computer graphics 1970 conference in england a linear algorithm for drawing ellipses and circles in 1971 l b smith published similar algorithms for all conic sections and proved them to have good properties 24 these algorithms need only a few multiplications and additions to calculate each vector it is beneficial to use a parametric formulation in computer graphics because the density of points is greatest where there is the most curvature thus the change in slope between each successive point is small reducing the apparent jaggedness of the approximation drawing with b zier paths composite b zier curves may also be used to draw an ellipse to sufficient accuracy since any ellipse may be construed as an affine transformation of a circle the spline methods used to draw a circle may be used to draw an ellipse since the constituent b zier curves behave appropriately under such transformations optimization
