atomic number 14 a hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre it is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor it is a member of group 14 in the periodic table along with carbon above it and germanium tin and lead below it is rather unreactive though less so than germanium and has a very large chemical affinity for oxygen as such it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by j ns jakob berzelius its melting and boiling points of 1414 c and 3265 c respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals being only surpassed by boron carbon sublimes rather than melts at atmospheric pressure albeit at a higher temperature than boron silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the earth s crust it is most widely distributed in dusts sands planetoids and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide silica or silicates over 90 of the earth s crust is composed of silicate minerals making silicon the second most abundant element in the earth s crust about 28 by mass after oxygen most silicon is used commercially without being separated and often with little processing of the natural minerals such use includes industrial construction with clays silica sand and stone silicates are used in portland cement for mortar and stucco and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways foundations and roads they are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain and in traditional quartz-based soda-lime glass and many other specialty glasses silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics elemental silicon also has a large impact on the modern world economy most free silicon is used in the steel refining aluminium-casting and fine chemical industries often to make fumed silica even more visibly the relatively small portion of very highly purified silicon used in semiconductor electronics 10 is essential to integrated circuits most computers cell phones and modern technology depend on it silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called silicones silicon is an essential element in biology although only tiny traces are required by animals however various sea sponges and microorganisms such as diatoms and radiolaria secrete skeletal structures made of silica silica is deposited in many plant tissues such as in the bark and wood of chrysobalanaceae and the silica cells and silicified trichomes of cannabis sativa horsetails and

see also 10 references 11 bibliography 12 external links history j ns jacob berzelius discoverer of silicon in 1787 antoine lavoisier suspected that silica might be an oxide of a fundamental chemical element 10 but the chemical affinity of silicon for oxygen is high enough that he had no means to reduce the oxide and isolate the element 11 after an attempt to isolate silicon in 1808 sir humphry davy proposed the name silicium for silicon from the latin silex silicis for flint and adding the -ium ending because he believed it to be a metal 12 most other languages use transliterated forms of davy s name sometimes adapted to local phonology e g german silizium turkish silisyum a few others use instead a calque of the latin root e g russian from flint greek from fire finnish pii from piikivi flint 13 in 1811 gay-lussac and th nard are thought to have prepared impure amorphous silicon through the heating of recently isolated potassium metal with silicon tetrafluoride but they did not purify and characterize the product nor identify it as a new element 14 silicon was given its present name in 1817 by scottish chemist thomas thomson he retained part of davy s name but added -on because he believed that silicon was a nonmetal similar to boron and carbon 15 in 1823 j ns jacob berzelius prepared amorphous silicon using approximately the same method as gay-lussac reducing potassium fluorosilicate with molten potassium metal but purifying the product to a brown powder by repeatedly washing it 16 as a result he is usually given credit for the element s discovery 17 18 the same year berzelius became the first to prepare silicon tetrachloride silicon tetrafluoride had already been prepared long before in 1771 by carl wilhelm scheele by dissolving silica in hydrofluoric acid 11 silicon in its more common crystalline form was not prepared until 31 years later by deville 19 20 by electrolyzing a mixture of sodium chloride and aluminium chloride containing approximately 10 silicon he was able to obtain a slightly impure allotrope of silicon in 1854 21 later more cost-effective methods have been developed to isolate several allotrope forms the most recent being silicene in 2010 22 23 meanwhile research on the chemistry of silicon continued friedrich w hler discovered the first volatile hydrides of silicon synthesising trichlorosilane in 1857 and silane itself in 1858 but a detailed investigation of the silanes was only carried out in the early 20th century by alfred stock despite early speculation on the matter dating as far back as the beginnings of synthetic organic chemistry in the 1830s 24 similarly the first organosilicon compound tetraethylsilane was synthesised by charles friedel and james crafts in 1863 but detailed characterisation of organosilicon chemisry was only done in the early 20th century by frederick kipping 11 starting in the 1920s the work of william lawrence bragg on x-ray crystallography successfully elucidated the compositions of the silicates which had previously been known from analytical chemistry but had not yet been understood together with linus pauling s development of crystal chemistry and victor goldschmidt s development of geochemistry the middle of the 20th century saw the development of the chemistry and industrial use of siloxanes and the growing use of silicone polymers elastomers and resins in the late 20th century the complexity of the crystal chemistry of silicides was mapped along with the solid-state chemistry of doped semiconductors 11 because silicon is an important element in high-technology semiconductor devices many places in the world bear its name for example santa clara valley in california acquired the nickname silicon valley since the element is the base material used in the semiconductor industry located there since then many other locations have been nicknamed for similar reasons 25 characteristics physical and atomic silicon crystallizes in a diamond cubic crystal structure a silicon atom has fourteen electrons in the ground state they are arranged in the electron configuration ne 3s23p2 of these four are valence electrons occupying the 3s orbital and two of the 3p orbitals like the other members of its group the lighter carbon and the heavier germanium tin and lead it has the same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals hence it can complete its octet and obtain the stable noble gas configuration of argon by forming sp3 hybrid orbitals forming tetrahedral six4 derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to 26 the first four ionisation energies of silicon are 786.3 1576.5 3228.3 and 4354.4 kj mol respectively these figures are high enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the element following periodic trends its single-bond covalent radius of 117.6 pm is intermediate between those of carbon 77.2 pm and germanium 122.3 pm the hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be 40 pm although this must be taken as a purely notional figure given the lack of a simple si4 cation in reality 27 at standard temperature and pressure silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre as typical for semiconductors its resistivity drops as temperature rises this arises because silicon has a small energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels the valence band and the lowest unoccupied ones the conduction band the fermi level is about halfway between the valence and conduction bands and is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature however doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus arsenic or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically creating an n-type semiconductor similarly doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron aluminium and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band creating a p-type semiconductor joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p-n junction with a common fermi level electrons flow from n to p while holes flow from p to n creating a voltage drop this p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other a transistor is an n-p-n junction with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier 28 silicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions specifically in a diamond cubic lattice it thus has a high melting point of 1414 c it is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures the general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure culminating in a hexagonal close-packed allotrope at about 40 gigapascals known as si vii the standard modification being si i silicon boils at 3265 c this while high is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes 3642 c and silicon similarly has a lower heat of vaporisation than carbon consistent with the fact that the si si bond is weaker than the c c bond 28 isotopes naturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable isotopes 28si 92.23 29si 4.67 and 30si 3.10 29 out of these only 29si is of use in nmr and epr spectroscopy 30 as it is the only one with a nuclear spin i 1 2 31 all three are produced in stars through the oxygen-burning process with 28si being made as part of the alpha process and hence the most abundant the fusion of 28si with alpha particles by photodisintegration rearrangement in stars is known as the silicon-burning process it is the last stage of stellar nucleosynthesis before the rapid collapse and violent explosion of the star in question in a type ii supernova 32 twenty radioisotopes have been characterized with the two stablest being 32si with a half-life of about 150 years and 31si with a half-life of 2.62 hours 29 all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than seven seconds and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than one tenth of a second 29 silicon does not have any known nuclear isomers 29 32si undergoes low-energy beta decay to 32p and then stable 32s 31si may be produced by the neutron activation of natural silicon and is thus useful for quantitative analysis it can be easily detected by its characteristic beta decay to stable 31p in which the emitted electron carries up to 1.48 mev of energy 31 the known isotopes of silicon range in mass number from 22 to 44 29 the most common decay mode of the isotopes with mass numbers lower than the three stable isotopes is inverse beta decay primarily forming aluminium isotopes 13 protons as decay products 29 the most common decay mode for the heavier unstable isotopes is beta decay primarily forming phosphorus isotopes 15 protons as decay products 29 chemistry and compounds c x and si x bond energies kj mol 24 x c si h f cl br i o n c x 368 360 435 453 351 293 216 360 305 si x 360 340 393 565 381 310 234 452 322 crystalline bulk silicon is rather inert but becomes more reactive at high temperatures like its neighbour aluminium silicon forms a thin continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide sio2 that protects the metal from oxidation thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900 c but formation of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between 950 c and 1160 c and when 1400 c is reached atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides sin and si3n4 silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600 c and gaseous phosphorus at 1000 c this oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature chlorine does so at about 300 c and bromine and iodine at about 500 c silicon does not react with most aqueous acids but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates at high temperatures silicon also reacts with alkyl halides this reaction can be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers upon melting silicon becomes extremely reactive alloying with most metals to form silicides and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large as a result containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4 5 and 6 borides 28 tetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry however the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise as well with the 3s subshell as a result the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon 33 and thus octahedral coordination is also significant 28 for example the electronegativity of silicon 1.90 is much less than that of carbon 2.55 because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus the poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency towards catenation formation of si si bonds for silicon than for carbon due to the concomitant weakening of the si si bond compared to the c c bond 34 the average si si bond energy is approximately 226 kj mol compared to a value of 356 kj mol for the c c bond 35 this results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts an example of the double bond rule on the other hand the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of silicon suggests the possibility of hypervalence as seen in five- and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as six 5 and sif2 6 34 lastly because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon this lowering of the main oxidation state in tandem with increasing atomic radii results in an increase of metallic character down the group silicon already shows some incipient metallic behaviour particularly in the behaviour of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases though this takes some effort and is hence often referred to as a metalloid rather than a nonmetal 34 however metallicity does not become clear until germanium and dominant until tin with the growing importance of the lower 2 oxidation state 11 silicon shows clear differences with carbon for example organic chemistry has very few analogies with silicon chemistry while silicate minerals have a structural complexity unseen in oxocarbons 11 silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon and this resemblance is enhanced by the d-block contraction resulting in the size of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than periodic trends would predict 27 nevertheless there are still some differences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in germanium compared to silicon that result in germanium being significantly more metallic than silicon additionally the lower ge o bond strength compared to the si o bond strength results in the absence of germanone polymers that would be analogous to silicone polymers 35 silicides phase diagram of the fe si system many metal silicides are known most of which have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to valence their bonding ranges from metallic to ionic and covalent some known stoichiometries are m6si m5si m4si m15si4 m3si m5si2 m2si m5si3 m3si2 msi m2si3 msi2 msi3 and msi6 they are structurally more similar to the borides than the carbides in keeping with the diagonal relationship between boron and silicon although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between the heats of formation of the silicides are usually similar to those of the borides and carbides of the same elements but they usually melt at lower temperatures 36 silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1 10 with the exception of beryllium in particular uranium and the transition metals of groups 4 10 show the widest range of stoichiometries except for copper the metals in groups 11 15 do not form silicides most instead form eutectic mixtures although the heaviest post-transition metals mercury thallium lead and bismuth are completely immiscible with liquid silicon 36 silicides are usually prepared by direct reaction of the elements for example the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals react with silicon or silicon oxide to give silicides nevertheless even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable and most of these compounds are semiconductors for example the alkali metal silicides m 4 e4 4 contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the si4 4 anion isoeelctronic with white phosphorus p4 36 37 metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms e g cu5si with increasing silicon content catenation increases resulting in isolated clusters of two e g u3si2 or four silicon atoms e g k 4 si4 4 at first followed by chains e g casi layers e g casi2 or three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space e g -thsi2 as the silicon content rises even higher 36 the silicides of the group 1 and 2 metals are usually more reactive than the transition metal silicides the latter usually do not react with aqueous reagents except for hydrofluoric acid however they do react with much more aggressive reagents like liquid potassium hydroxide or gaseous fluorine or chlorine when red-hot the pre-transition metal silicides instead readily react with water and aqueous acids usually producing hydrogen or silanes 36 na 2si 3 h 2o na 2sio 3 3 h 2 mg 2si 2 h 2so 4 2 mgso 4 sih 4 products often vary with the stoichiometry of the silicide reactant for example ca2si is polar and non-conducting and has the anti-pbcl2 structure with single isolated silicon atoms and reacts with water to produce calcium hydroxide hydrated silicon dioxide and hydrogen gas casi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and polymeric sih2 while casi2 with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid the product is a yellow polymeric solid with stoichiometry si2h2o 36 silanes speculation on silicon hydride chemistry started from the 1830s contemporary with the development of synthetic organic chemistry silane itself as well as trichlorosilane were first synthesised by friedrich w hler and heinrich buff in 1857 by reacting aluminium silicon alloys with hydrochloric acid and characterised as sih4 and sihcl3 by charles friedel and albert ladenburg in 1867 disilane si2h6 followed in 1902 when it was first made by henri moissan and samuel smiles by the protonolysis of magnesium silicides further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes it was then that alfred stock began the study of silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques as they were found as contaminants of his focus the boron hydrides the names silanes and boranes are due to him based on analogy with the alkanes 24 38 39 moissan and smiles method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal silicides is still used although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously and thus the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride in etheric solutions at low temperatures direct reaction of hx or rx with silicon possibly with a catalyst such as copper is also a viable method to produce substituted silanes 24 the silanes comprise a homologous series of silicon hydrides with the general formula sinh2n 2 they are all strong reducing agents unbranched and branched trains are known up to n 8 and the cycles si5h10 and si6h12 are also known the first two silane and disilane are colourless gases the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids all silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air they become less thermally stable with room temperature so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature although disilane does not decompose very quickly only 2.5 of a sample decomposes after eight months have passed 24 they decompose to form polymeric polysilicon hydride and hydrogen gas 40 41 as expected from the difference in atomic weight the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes but more volatile than the corresponding germanes they are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes because the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitates nucleophilic attack at the silicon the greater polarity of the si h bond compared to the c h bond and the ability of silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction s activation energy 24 silane pyrolysis gives polymeric species and finally elemental silicon and hydrogen indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially produced by the pyrolysis of silane while the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a c h or c c bond and the formation of radical intermediates polysilanes decompose by eliminating silenes sih2 or sihr as the activation energy of this process 210 kj mol is much less than the si si and si h bond energies while pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide if the reaction is carried out in methanol controlled solvolysis results in the products sih2 ome 2 sih ome 3 and si ome 4 the si h bond also adds to alkenes a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved at 450 c silane participates in an addition reaction with acetone as well as a ring-opening reaction with ethylene oxide direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature but the reaction of silane with bromine at 80 c is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane the monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate hydrogen halide with an al2x6 catalyst or by reacting silane with a solid silver halide in a heated flow reactor 24 sih 4 2 agcl 260 c sih3cl hcl 2 ag among the derivatives of silane iodosilane sih3i and potassium silanide ksih3 are very useful synthetic intermediates in the production of more complicated silicon-containing compounds the latter is a colourless crystalline ionic solid containing k cations and sih 3 anions in the nacl structure and is made by the reduction of silane by potassium metal 42 additionally the reactive hypervalent species sih 5 is also known 24 with suitable organic substituents it is possible to produce stable polysilanes they have surprisingly high electric conductivities arising from sigma delocalisation of the electrons in the chain 43 halides silicon and silicon carbide readily react with all four stable halogens forming the colourless reactive and volatile silicon tetrahalides 44 silicon tetrafluoride may also be made by fluorinating the other silicon halides and is produced by the attack of hydrofluoric acid on glass 45 heating two different tetrahalides together also produce a random mixture of mixed halides which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions the melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight though there are many exceptions for example the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from sifbr3 through sifclbr2 to sifcl2br the shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements is illustrated by the change from an infinite ionic structure in aluminium fluoride to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon the stoichiometry the 4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom 44 silicon tetrachloride is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon silicon dioxide and some silicon esters 44 the silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water unlike the carbon tetrahalides again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks 45 the reaction of silicon fluoride with excess hydrofluoric acid produces the octahedral hexafluorosilicate anion sif2 6 45 analogous to the silanes halopolysilanes sinx2n 2 are also known while catenation in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds rather than the halides the opposite is true for silicon so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least si14f30 si6cl14 and si4br10 a suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by pi backbonding from the filled p orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty d orbitals on silicon this is similar to the situation of carbon monoxide in metal carbonyl complexes and explains their stability these halopolysilanes may be produced by comproportionation of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes trimethylammonium being a useful catalyst for this reaction 44 silica silicon dioxide sio2 also known as silica is one of the most well-studied compounds second only to water twelve different crystal modifications of silica are known the most common being -quartz a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone it is also known to occur pure as rock crystal impure forms are known as rose quartz smoky quartz morion amethyst and citrine some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known such as chalcedony chrysoprase carnelian agate onyx jasper heliotrope and flint other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite biologically generated forms are also known as kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tektites and obsidian and rarely as lechatelierite some synthetic forms are known as keatite and w-silica opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide 46 quartz sandstone smoky quartz amethyst citrine agate chrysoprase onyx jasper heliotrope tridymite cristobalite coesite lechatelierite most crystalline forms of silica are made of infinite arrangements of sio4 tetrahedra with si at the centre connected at their corners with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms in the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form -quartz these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different si o distances 159.7 and 161.7 pm with a si o si angle of 144 these helices can be either left- or right-handed so that individual -quartz crystals are optically active at 537 c this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar -quartz with a change of the si o si angle to 155 but a retention of handedness further heating to 867 c results in another reversible phase transition to -tridymite in which some si o bonds are broken to allow for the arrangement of the sio4 tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure this transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature when cooled to about 120 c it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to -tridymite similarly to the transition from -quartz to -quartz -tridymite slowly transforms to cubic -cristobalite at about 1470 c which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200 280 c to -cristobalite via small atomic displacements -cristobalite melts at 1713 c the freezing of silica from the melt is quite slow and vitrification or the formation of a glass is likely to occur instead in vitreous silica the sio4 tetrahedra remain corner-connected but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost because of the slow conversions between these three forms it is possible upon rapid heating to melt -quartz 1550 c or -tridymite 1703 c silica boils at approximately 2800 c other high-pressure forms of silica are known such as coesite and stishovite these are known in nature formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following lightning strikes forming glassy lechatelierite w-silica is an unstable low-density form involving sio4 tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners forming parallel chains similarly to silicon disulfide sis2 and silicon diselenide sise2 it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water 46 condensed polysilicic acid silica is rather inert chemically it is not attacked by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid however it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates to give metal silicates among the elements it is attacked only by fluorine at room temperature to form silicon tetrafluoride hydrogen and carbon also react but require temperatures over 1000 c to do so silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and metalloid oxides to form a wide variety of compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all but also have many other uses for example sodium silicate is often used in detergents due to its buffering saponifying and emulsifying properties 46 silicic acids adding water to silica drops its melting point by around 800 c due to the breaking of the structure by replacing si o si linkages with terminating si oh groups increasing water concentration results in the formation of hydrated silica gels and colloidal silica dispersions many hydrates and silicic acids exist in the most dilute of aqueous solutions but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and cross-link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following the formula siox oh 4 2x n similar to the behaviour of boron aluminium and iron among other elements hence although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions such as orthosilicic acid si oh 4 and metasilicic acid sio oh 2 none of these are likely to exist in the solid state 46 silicate minerals typical coordination of metal cations in silicates ionic radii in pm 47 cn 4 lii 59 beii 27 aliii 39 siiv 26 cn 6 nai 102 mgii 72 aliii 54 tiiv 61 feii 78 cn 8 ki 151 caii 112 cn 12 ki 164 about 95 of the earth s crustal rocks are made of silica or silicate and aluminosilicate minerals as reflected in oxygen silicon and aluminium being the three most common elements in the crust in that order 47 measured by mass silicon makes up 27.7 of the earth s crust 48 pure silicon crystals are very rarely found in nature but notable exceptions are crystals as large as to 0.3 mm across found during sampling gasses from the kudriavy volcano on the island of iturup one of the kuril islands 49 50 silicate and aluminosilicate minerals have many different structures and varying stoichiometry but they may be classified following some general principles tetrahedral sio4 units are common to almost all these compounds either as discrete structures or combined into larger units by the sharing of corner oxygen atoms these may be divided into neso-silicates discrete sio4 units sharing no oxygen atoms soro-silicates discrete si2o7 units sharing one cyclo-silicates closed ring structures and ino-silicates continuous chain or ribbon structures both sharing two phyllo-silicates continuous sheets sharing three and tecto-silicates continuous three-dimensional frameworks sharing four the lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close-packed or close to it with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size 47 the orthosilicates mii 2sio 4 m be mg mn fe zn and zrsio4 are neso-silicates be2sio4 phenacite is rather unusual as both beii and siiv occupy tetrahedral four-coordinated sites the other divalent cations instead occupy six-coordinated octahedral sites and often isomorphously replace each other as in olivine mg fe mn 2sio4 zircon zrsio4 demands eight-coordination of the zriv cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius 84 pm also significant are the garnets mii 3miii 2 sio 4 3 in which the divalent cations e g ca mg fe are eight-coordinated and the trivalent ones are six-coordinated e g al cr fe regular coordination is not always present for example it is not found in ca2sio4 which mixes six- and eight-coordinate sites for caii soro-silicates involving discrete double or triple tetrahedral units are quite rare metasilicates involving cyclic sio3 n 2n units of corner-abutting tetrahedra forming a polygonal ring are also known 47 chain metasilicates sio2 3 form by the corner-sharing of an indefinite chain of linked sio4 tetrahedra many differences arise due to the differing repeat distances of conformation across the line of tetrahedra a repeat distance of two is most common as in most pyroxene minerals but repeat distances of one three four five six seven nine and twelve are also known these chains can then link across each other to form double chains and ribbons as in the asbestos minerals involving repeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings 47 a typical zeolite structure layer silicates such as the clay minerals and the micas are very common and are often formed by horizontal cross-linking of metasilicate chains or planar condensation of smaller units an example is kaolinite al2 oh 4si2o5 in many of these minerals cation and anion replacement is common so that for example tetrahedral siiv may be replaced by aliii octahedral aliii by mgii and oh by f three-dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex they may be conceived of as starting from the sio2 structure but having replaced up to one-half of the siiv atoms with aliii they require more cations to be included in the structure to balance charge examples include feldspars the most abundant minerals on the earth zeolites and ultramarines many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of the ternary system naalsi3o8 kalsi3o8 caal2si2o8 their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting aliii to undergo six-coordination rather than four-coordination and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for the mohorovi i discontinuity which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same chemical composition but different lattices although this is not a universally held view zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks truncated cuboctahedra being most common but other polyhedra are also known as zeolite cavities allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as cl so2 4 and s2 2 but are otherwise similar to the feldspars 47 other inorganic compounds silicon disulfide sis2 is formed by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at 100 c sublimation of the resulting compound in nitrogen results in white flexible long fibres reminiscent of asbestos with a structure similar to w-silica this melts at 1090 c and sublimes at 1250 c at high temperature and pressure this transforms to a crystal structure analogous to cristobalite however sis2 lacks the variety of structures of sio2 and quickly hydrolyses to silica and hydrogen sulfide it is also ammonoloysed quickly and completely by liquid ammonia as follows to form an imide 51 sis 2 4 nh 3 si nh 2 2 nh 4sh it reacts with the sulfides of sodium magnesium aluminium and iron to form metal thiosilicates reaction with ethanol results in ethylsilicate si oet 4 and hydrogen sulfide ethylsilicate is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or film-like forms of silica reacting hydrogen sulfide with silicon tetrahalides yields silicon thiohalides such as s sicl 3 cyclic cl2si -s 2sicl2 and crystalline siscl2 4 despite the double bond rule stable organosilanethiones rr si s have been made thanks to the stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an amine group 51 silicon nitride si3n4 can be formed by directly reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300 c but a more economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500 c it would make a promising ceramic if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it it is chemically near-totally inert and even above 1000 c it keeps its strength shape and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion it is very hard 9 on the mohs hardness scale dissociates only at 1900 c at 1 atm and is quite dense density 3.185 g cm3 because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite be2sio4 a similar refractory material is si2n2o formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450 c in an argon stream containing 5 nitrogen gas involving 4-coordinate silicon and 3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non-linear si o si linkages to each other 51 reacting silyl halides with ammonia or alkylammonia derivatives in the gaseous phase or in ethanolic solution produces various volatile silylamides which are silicon analogues of the amines 51 3 sih 3cl 4 nh 3 n sih 3 3 3 nh 4cl sih 3br 2 me 2nh sih 3nme 2 me 2nh 2br 4 sih 3i 5 n 2h 4 sih 3 2nn sih 3 2 4 n 2h 5i many such compounds have been prepared the only known restriction being that the nitrogen is always tertiary and species containing the sih nh group are unstable at room temperature the stoichiometry around the nitrogen atom in compounds such as n sih3 3is planar which has been attributed to a p d interaction between a lone pair on nitrogen and an empty d orbital on silicon similarly trisilylamines are weaker as ligands than their carbon analogues the tertiary amines although substitution of some sih3 groups by ch3 groups mitigates this weakness thus for example n sih3 3 does not form an adduct with bh3 at all while men sih3 2 and me2nsih3 form adducts at low temperatures that decompose upon warming some silicon analogues of imines with a si n double bond are known the first found was but2si n sibut3 which was discovered in 1986 51 silicon carbide silicon carbide sic was first made by edward goodrich acheson in 1891 who named it carborundum to reference its intermediate hardness and abrasive power between diamond an allotrope of carbon and corundum aluminium oxide he soon founded a company to manufacture it and today about one million tonnes are produced each year 52 silicon carbide exists in about 250 crystalline forms 53 the polymorphism of sic is characterized by a large family of similar crystalline structures called polytypes they are variations of the same chemical compound that are identical in two dimensions and differ in the third thus they can be viewed as layers stacked in a certain sequence 54 it is made industrially by reduction of quartz sand with excess coke or anthracite at 2000 2500 c in an electric furnace 52 sio 2 2 c si 2 co si c sic it is the most thermally stable binary silicon compound only decomposing through loss of silicon starting from around 2700 c it is resistant to most aqueous acids phosphoric acid being an exception it forms a protective layer of silicon dioxide on the surface and hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000 c removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas which forms sicl4 and carbon at 100 c and sicl4 and ccl4 at 1000 c it is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory materia as it is chemically stable and very strong and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge it is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped 52 in its diamond-like behaviour it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon 55 organosilicon compounds a hydrosilylation reaction in which si h is added to an unsaturated substrate because the si c bond is close in strength to the c c bond organosilicon compounds tend to be markedly thermally and chemically stable for example tetraphenylsilane siph4 may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of 428 c and so can its substituted derivatives ph3sicl and ph2sicl2 which boil at 378 c and 305 c respectively furthermore since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners organosilicon chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry for example in the propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming multiple bonds 55 however significant differences also arise since silicon is more electropositive than carbon bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon and vice versa thus the si f bond is significantly stronger than even the c f bond and is one of the strongest single bonds while the si h bond is much weaker than the c h bond and is readily broken furthermore the ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon and hence some organosilicon reactions have no organic analogues for example nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by the sn2 or sn1 processes but instead goes through a negatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom this works for silicon unlike for carbon because the long si c bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the d-orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack unlike for example a c o antibonding orbital nevertheless despite these differences the mechanism is still often called sn2 at silicon for simplicity 56 one of the most useful silicon-containing groups is trimethylsilyl me3si the si c bond connecting it to the rest of the molecule is reasonably strong allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed for example by the fluoride ion which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds it may be compared to acidic protons while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases both removals usually promote elimination as a general rule while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table e g sulfur selenium or iodine or even both silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen fluorine or chlorine for example enolates react at the carbon in haloalkanes but at the oxygen in silyl chlorides and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the silyl ether hexamethyldisiloxane me3si 2o conversely while the sn2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge at the carbon the analogous sn2 reaction at silicon is so affected thus for example the silyl triflates are so electrophilic that they react 108 to 109 times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles trimethylsilyl triflate is in particular a very good lewis acid and is used to convert carbonyl compounds to acetals and silyl enol ethers reacting them together analogously to the aldol reaction 56 si c bonds are commonly formed in three ways in the laboratory preparation is often carried out in small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with organolithium grignard or organoaluminium reagents or by catalytic addition of si h across c c double bonds the second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes the methyl and phenyl silanes organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10 by weight metallic copper as a catalyst standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners readily undergoing hydrolysis ammonolysis alcoholysis and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers 55 silicone polymers structure of polydimethylsiloxane the principal component of silicones the word silicone was first used by frederick kipping in 1901 he invented the word to illustrate the similarity of chemical formulae between ph2sio and benzophenone ph2co although he also stressed the lack of chemical resemblance due to the polymeric structure of ph2sio which is not shared by ph2co 55 silicones may be considered analogous to mineral silicates in which the methyl groups of the silicones correspond to the isoelectronic o of the silicates 55 they are quite stable to extreme temperatures oxidation and water and have useful dielectric antistick and antifoam properties furthermore they are resistant over long periods of time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering and are inert physiologically they are fairly unreactive but do react with concentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents and occasionally can be even used as mild reagents for selective syntheses for example me3si 2o is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of molybdenum and tungsten oxyhalides converting a tungsten hexachloride suspension in dichloroethane solution quantitatively to wocl4 in under an hour at room temperature and then to yellow wo2cl2 at 100 c in light petroleum at a yield of 95 overnight 55 occurrence olivine in the universe silicon is the seventh most abundant element coming after hydrogen helium carbon nitrogen oxygen and neon these abundances are not replicated well on earth due to substantial separation of the elements taking place during the formation of the solar system silicon makes up 27.2 of the earth s crust by weight second only to oxygen at 45.5 with which it is always associated in nature further fractionation took place in the formation of the earth by planetary differentiation earth s core which makes up 31.5 of the mass of the earth has approximate composition fe25ni2co0.1s3 the mantle makes up 68.1 of the earth s mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates an example being olivine mg fe 2sio4 while the lighter siliceous minerals rise to the surface and form the crust making up 0.4 of the earth s mass 57 the crystallisation of igneous rocks from magma depends on a number of factors among them are the chemical composition of the magma the cooling rate and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed such as lattice energy melting point and complexity of their crystal structure as magma is cooled olivine appears first followed by pyroxene amphibole biotite mica orthoclase feldspar muscovite mica quartz zeolites and finally hydrothermal minerals this sequence shows a trend towards increasingly complex silicate units with cooling and the introduction of hydroxide and fluoride anions in addition to oxides many metals can substitute for silicon after these igneous rocks undergo weathering transport and deposition sedimentary rocks like clay shale and sandstone are formed metamorphism also can occur at high temperatures and pressures creating an even vaster variety of minerals 57 production silicon of 96 99 purity is made by reducing quartzite or sand with highly pure coke the reduction is carried out in an electric arc furnace with an excess of sio2 used to stop silicon carbide from accumulating 31 sio 2 2 c si 2 co 2 sic sio 2 3 si 2 co ferrosilicon alloy this reaction known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide is usually conducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of phosphorus and sulfur produing ferrosilicon 31 ferrosilicon an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron accounts for about 80 of the world s production of elemental silicon with china the leading supplier of elemental silicon providing 4.6 million tonnes or 2 3 of the world output of silicon most of which is in the form of ferrosilicon it is followed by russia 610,000 t norway 330,000 t brazil 240,000 t and the united states 170,000 t 58 ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and steel industry see below with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de-oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants 31 another sometimes used reaction is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide as follows 59 3 sio 2 4 al 3 si 2 al 2o 3 leaching powdered 96 97 pure silicon with water results in 98.5 pure silicon which is used in the chemical industry however even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane or trichlorosilane the former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of silicone production these compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated fractional distillation followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure zinc metal as the reeducing agent the spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals before being purified by zone refining other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane another process used is the reduction of sodium hexafluorosilicate a common waste product of the phosphate fertiliser industry by metallic sodium this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost every other material transistor production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 1010 and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 1012 are needed and attained 31 applications compounds most silicon is used industrially without being purified and indeed often with comparatively little processing from its natural form over 90 of the earth s crust is composed of silicate minerals which are compounds of silicon and oxygen often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge many of these have direct commercial uses such as clays silica sand and most kinds of building stone thus the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds either as the silicate minerals or silica crude silicon dioxide silicates are used in making portland cement made mostly of calcium silicates which is used in building mortar and modern stucco but more importantly combined with silica sand and gravel usually containing silicate minerals like granite to make the concrete that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world 60 silica is used to make fire brick a type of ceramic silicate minerals are also in whiteware ceramics an important class of products usually containing various types of fired clay minerals natural aluminium phyllosilicates an example is porcelain which is based on the silicate mineral kaolinite traditional glass silica-based soda-lime glass also functions in many of the same ways and is also used for windows and containers in addition specialty silica based glass fibers are used for optical fiber as well as to produce fiberglass for structural support and glass wool for thermal insulation silicones are often used in waterproofing treatments molding compounds mold-release agents mechanical seals high temperature greases and waxes and caulking compounds silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants contact lenses explosives and pyrotechnics 61 silly putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil 62 other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide silicon is a component of some superalloys alloys elemental silicon is added to molten cast iron as ferrosilicon or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of cementite where exposed to outside air the presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen so that the steel carbon content which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel can be more closely controlled ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure it accounts for 80 of the world s use of free silicon silicon is an important constituent of electrical steel modifying its resistivity and ferromagnetic properties the properties of silicon can be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron metallurgical grade silicon is silicon of 95 99 purity about 55 of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys silumin alloys for aluminium part casts mainly for use in the automotive industry silicon s importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount 12 of silicon in aluminium forms a eutectic mixture which solidifies with very little thermal contraction this greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium 63 64 electronics silicon wafer with mirror finish most elemental silicon produced remains as a ferrosilicon alloy and only about 20 is refined to metallurgical grade purity a total of 1.3 1.5 million metric tons year an estimated 15 of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity 64 however the economic importance of this small very high-purity fraction especially the 5 which is processed to monocrystalline silicon for integrated circuits is disproportionately large pure monocrystalline silicon is used to produce silicon wafers used in the semiconductor industry in electronics and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor which means that unlike metals it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat silicon s electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures pure silicon has too low a conductivity i e too high a resistivity to be used as a circuit element in electronics in practice pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge positive or negative of activated carriers such control is necessary for transistors solar cells semiconductor detectors and other semiconductor devices used in the computer industry and other technical applications in silicon photonics silicon can be used as a continuous wave raman laser medium to produce coherent light though it is ineffective as an everyday light source in common integrated circuits a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for the circuits which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of silicon oxide an insulator that is easily produced by exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering avalanche breakdown an electron avalanche is created when heat produces free electrons and holes which in turn pass more current which produces more heat in addition the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water which gives it an advantage over germanium an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices in certain fabrication techniques 65 monocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths for other uses other types of pure silicon may be employed these include hydrogenated amorphous silicon and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon umg-si used in the production of low-cost large-area electronics in applications such as liquid crystal displays and of large-area low-cost thin-film solar cells such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline and are produced in comparable quatities as the monocrystalline silicon 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year the market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon by 2013 polycrystalline silicon production used mostly in solar cells was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons year 64 biological role a diatom enclosed in a silica cell wall although silicon is readily available in the form of silicates very few organisms use it directly diatoms radiolaria and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a structural material for skeletons in more advanced plants the silica phytoliths opal phytoliths are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell some plants for example rice need silicon for their growth 66 67 68 there is some evidence that silicon is important to nail hair bone and skin health in humans 69 for example in studies that show that premenopausal women with higher dietary silicon intake have higher bone density and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and density in patients with osteoporosis 70 silicon is needed for synthesis of elastin and collagen of which the aorta contains the greatest quantity in the human body 71 and has been considered an essential element 72 nevertheless it is difficult to prove its essentiality because silicon is very common and hence deficiency symptoms are difficult to reproduce 73 silicon is currently under consideration for elevation to the status of a plant beneficial substance by the association of american plant food control officials aapfco 74 75 silicon has been shown to improve plant cell wall strength and structural integrity in some plants 76 improve drought and frost resistance decrease lodging potential and boost the plant s natural pest and disease fighting systems 77 safety people can be exposed to silicon in the workplace by breathing it in swallowing it skin contact and eye contact the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for silicon exposure in the workplace as 15 mg m3 total exposure and 5 mg m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of 10 mg m3 total exposure and 5 mg m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday 78 see also amorphous silicon black
