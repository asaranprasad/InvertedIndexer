defined in the k ppen climate classification as having a coldest month mean temperature below -3 c 26.6 f or 0 c 32 f depending on which isotherm is used for the coldest month and for the four months above 10 c in the k ppen climate system continental climates are bordered to the south by temperate climates or c climates coldest month above 0 c but below 18 c and to the north by boreal climate or e climates only 1 to 3 months with a mean temperature of 10 c or 50 f k ppen also defined continental climates as having more than 30 days with continuous snowcover on the ground continental climates often have a significant annual variation in temperature hot summers and cold winters specify they tend to occur in the middle latitudes 40 to 55 north where prevailing winds blow overland and temperatures are not moderated by bodies of water such as oceans or seas continental climates occur mostly in the northern hemisphere which has the kind of large landmasses required for this type of climate to develop most of northern and northeastern china eastern and southeastern europe central and southeastern canada and the central and upper eastern united states have this type of climate 1 in continental climates precipitation tends to be moderate in amount concentrated mostly in the warmer months only a few areas in the mountains of the pacific northwest of north america and in iran northern iraq adjacent turkey afghanistan pakistan and central asia show a winter maximum in precipitation a portion of the annual precipitation falls as snowfall and snow often remains on the ground for more than a month summers in continental climates can feature thunderstorms and frequent cool temperatures however summer weather is more stable than winter weather contents 1 spring and autumn 2

for example spring may arrive as soon as early march in the southern parts of this zone or as late as may in the north annual precipitation in this zone is usually between 600 millimetres 24 in and 1,200 millimetres 47 in most of it in the form of snow during winter it also has cold winters and warm summers k ppen climate classification edit most such areas fit k ppen classifications of dfa dwa cold winters hot summers w indicating very dry winters characteristic especially of china or dfb or dwb cold winters warm summers same distinction for winter dryness dry summer continental climates dsa and dsb exist in high altitude areas near mediterranean climates in some cases the semi-arid climate classification of bsk can also be considered to be continental as long as it has cold winters the definition of this climate regarding temperature is as follows the mean temperature of the coldest month must be below 3 c 26.6 f and there must be at least four months whose mean temperatures are at or above 10 c 50 f some climatologists use the 0 c isotherm instead for the coldest month climatology edit continental climates exist where cold air masses infiltrate during the winter and warm air masses form in summer under conditions of high sun and long days places with continental climates are as a rule are either far from any moderating effect of oceans examples omaha nebraska and kazan russia or are so situated that prevailing winds tend to head offshore example boston usa such regions get quite warm in the summer achieving temperatures characteristic of tropical climates but are colder than any other climates of similar latitude in the winter neighbouring climates edit in the koppen climate system these climates grade off toward temperate climates equator-ward where winters are less severe and semi-arid climates where precipitation becomes inadequate for tall-grass prairies in europe these climates may grade off into oceanic climates in which the influence of cool oceanic air masses is more marked toward the west the subarctic climate k ppen dfc with very cold long and dry winters but with at least one month above 10 c 50 f might be considered a sub-type of the
