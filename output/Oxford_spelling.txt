https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling oxford spelling from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search oxford spelling also oxford english dictionary spelling oxford style or oxford english spelling 1 is the spelling standard used by the oxford university press oup for british publications including its oxford english dictionary oed and its influential british style guide hart s rules and by other publishers who are etymology conscious according to merriam-webster 2 oxford spelling is best known for its preference for the suffix -ize in words like organize and recognize versus the -ise endings that are also commonly used in current british english usage 3 the spelling affects about 200 verbs and is favoured because -ize corresponds more closely to the greek root -izo - of most -ize verbs 4 in addition to the oup s oxford -branded dictionaries other british dictionary publishers that list -ize suffixes first include cassell collins and longman 5 oxford spelling is used by many british academic science journals for example nature and many international organizations for example the united nations and its agencies 6 7 it is common for academic formal and technical writing for an international readership see usage in digital documents oxford spelling may be indicated by the ietf language tag en-gb-oxendict or historically by en-gb-oed 8 contents 1 defining features 2 usage 3 language tag comparison 4 see also 5 notes 6 bibliography 7 further reading defining features edit oxford spelling can be recognized by its use of the suffix ize instead of -ise organization privatize and recognizable instead of organisation privatise and recognisable the spelling affects about 200 verbs and is favoured on etymological grounds in that -ize corresponds more closely to the greek root -izo of most -ize verbs 4 the suffix -ize has been in use in the uk since the 15th century 9 and is the spelling variation used in american english the belief that -ize is an exclusively american variant is incorrect 9 the oed lists the -ise form of words separately as a frequent spelling of -ize this practice probably began first in french in modern french the suffix has become -iser alike in words from greek as baptiser vang liser organiser and those formed after them from latin as civiliser cicatriser humaniser hence some have used the spelling -ise in english as in french for all these words and some prefer -ise in words formed in french or english from latin elements retaining -ize for those formed from greek elements however the suffix itself whatever the element to which it is added is in its origin the greek - latin - iz re and as the pronunciation is also with z there is no reason why in english the special french spelling should be followed in opposition to that which is at once etymological and phonetic in this dictionary the termination is uniformly written -ize in the greek - - the i was short so originally in latin but the double consonant z dz ts made the syllable long when the z became a simple consonant -idz became z whence english -a z the use of -ize instead of -ise does not affect the spelling of words that are not traced to the greek -izo suffix one group of such words is those that end in -yse actually -lyse such as analyse paralyse and catalyse which come from the greek verb lyo others include arise

the uk normally use -ise the style guide of the times recommended -ize until 1992 when it switched to -ise 10 the newspaper s chief revise editor richard dixon wrote of the change in the great -ize versus -ise debate the times has opted latterly for simplicity over a sort of erudition but in the style guide of 1992 the following entry appeared -ise -isation avoid the z construction in almost all cases this is volcanic ground with common usage straining the crust of classical etymology this guidance is a revision of the greek zeta root ending in the direction of a latin ending and common usage apologise organise emphasise televise circumcise the only truly awkward result is capsize which should be left in its grecian peace 10 in both the king james bible and the works of shakespeare -ize
