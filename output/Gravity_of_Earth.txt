the theoretical gravity of an idealized smooth earth the so-called earth ellipsoid red shows the areas where gravity is stronger than the smooth standard value and blue reveals areas where gravity is weaker animated version 1 the gravity of earth which is denoted by g refers to the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within earth in si units this acceleration is measured in metres per second squared in symbols m s2 or m s 2 or equivalently in newtons per kilogram n kg or n kg 1 near earth s surface gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m s2 which means that ignoring the effects of air resistance the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 9.8 metres per second every second this quantity is sometimes referred to informally as little g in contrast the gravitational constant g is referred to as big g the precise strength of earth s gravity varies depending on location the nominal average value at earth s surface known as standard gravity is by definition 9.80665 m s2 2 this quantity is denoted variously as gn ge though this sometimes means the normal equatorial value on earth 9.78033 m s2 g0 gee or simply g which is also used for the variable local value the weight of an object on earth s surface is the downwards force on that object given by newton s second law of motion or f ma force mass acceleration gravitational acceleration contributes to the total acceleration but other factors such as the rotation of earth also contribute and therefore affect the weight of the object contents 1 variation in

gravity and apparent gravity edit a perfect sphere of uniform mass density or whose density varies solely with distance from the centre spherical symmetry would produce a gravitational field of uniform magnitude at all points on its surface always pointing directly towards the sphere s centre the earth is not spherically symmetric but is slightly flatter at the poles while bulging at the equator an oblate spheroid there are consequently slight deviations in both the magnitude and direction of gravity across its surface the net force or corresponding net acceleration as measured by a scale and plumb bob is called effective gravity or apparent gravity effective gravity includes other factors that affect the net force these factors vary and include things such as centrifugal force 3 at the surface from the earth s rotation and the gravitational pull of the moon and sun effective gravity on the earth s surface varies by around 0.7 from 9.7639 m s2 on the nevado huascar n mountain in peru to 9.8337 m s2 at the surface of the arctic ocean 4 in large cities it ranges from 9.7760 5 in kuala lumpur mexico city and singapore to 9.825 in oslo and helsinki legal definition edit in 1901 the third general conference on weights and measures defined a standard gravitational acceleration for the surface of the earth gn 9.80665 m s2 the larger variations described below were not yet known therefore this definition is not a value of any particular place or carefully worked out average but an agreement for a value to use if a better actual local value is not known or not important 6 latitude edit the differences of earth s gravity around the antarctic continent the surface of the earth is rotating so it is not an inertial frame of reference at latitudes nearer the equator the outward centrifugal force produced by earth s rotation is larger than at polar latitudes this counteracts the earth s gravity to a small degree up to a maximum of 0.3 at the equator and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of falling objects the second major reason for the difference in gravity at different latitudes is that the earth s equatorial bulge itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation causes objects at the equator to be farther from the planet s centre than objects at the poles because the force due to gravitational attraction between two bodies the earth and the object being weighed varies inversely with the square of the distance between them an object at the equator experiences a weaker gravitational pull than an object at the poles in combination the equatorial bulge and the effects of the surface centrifugal force due to rotation mean that sea-level effective gravity increases from about 9.780 m s2 at the equator to about 9.832 m s2 at the poles so an object will weigh about 0.5 more at the poles than at the equator 3 7 the same two factors influence the direction of the effective gravity as determined by a plumb line or as the perpendicular to the surface of water in a container anywhere on earth away from the equator or poles effective gravity points not exactly toward the centre of the earth but rather perpendicular to the surface of the geoid which due to the flattened shape of the earth is somewhat toward the opposite pole about half of the deflection is due to centrifugal force and half because the extra mass around the equator causes a change in the direction of the true gravitational force relative to what it would be on a spherical earth altitude edit the graph shows the variation in gravity relative to the height of an object above the surface gravity decreases with altitude as one rises above the earth s surface because greater altitude means greater distance from the earth s centre all other things being equal an increase in altitude from sea level to 9,000 metres 30,000 ft causes a weight decrease of about 0.29 an additional factor affecting apparent weight is the decrease in air density at altitude which lessens an object s buoyancy 8 this would increase a person s apparent weight at an altitude of 9,000 metres by about 0.08 it is a common misconception that astronauts in orbit are weightless because they have flown high enough to escape the earth s gravity in fact at an altitude of 400 kilometres 250 mi equivalent to a typical orbit of the space shuttle gravity is still nearly 90 as strong as at the earth s surface weightlessness actually occurs because orbiting objects are in free-fall 9 the effect of ground elevation depends on the density of the ground see slab correction section a person flying at 30 000 ft above sea level over mountains will feel more gravity than someone at the same elevation but over the sea however a person standing on the earth s surface feels less gravity when the elevation is higher the following formula approximates the earth s gravity variation with altitude g h g 0 r e r e h 2 displaystyle g h g 0 left frac r mathrm e r mathrm e h right 2 where gh is the gravitational acceleration at height h above sea level re is the earth s mean radius g0 is the standard gravitational acceleration the formula treats the earth as a perfect sphere with a radially symmetric distribution of mass a more accurate mathematical treatment is discussed below depth edit an approximate value for gravity at a distance r from the center of the earth can be obtained by assuming that the earth s density is spherically symmetric the gravity depends only on the mass inside the sphere of radius r all the contributions from outside cancel out as a consequence of the inverse-square law of gravitation another consequence is that the gravity is the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center thus the gravitational acceleration at this radius is 10 g r g m r r 2 displaystyle g r - frac gm r r 2 where g is the gravitational constant and m r is the total mass enclosed within radius r if the earth had a constant density the mass would be m r 4 3 r3 and the dependence of gravity on depth would be g r 4 3 g r displaystyle g r frac 4 pi 3 g rho r g at depth d is given by g g 1-d r where g is acceleration due to gravity on surface of the earth d is

williamson equation is shown in the graphs below earth s radial density distribution according to the preliminary reference earth model prem 11 earth s gravity according to the preliminary reference earth model prem 11 two models for a spherically symmetric earth are included for comparison the dark green straight line is for a constant density equal to the earth s average density the light green curved line is for a density that decreases linearly from center to surface the density at the center is the same as in the prem but the surface density is chosen so that the mass of the sphere equals the mass of the real earth local topography and geology edit local differences in topography such as the presence of mountains geology such as the density of rocks in the vicinity and deeper tectonic structure cause local and regional differences in the earth s gravitational field known as gravitational anomalies 12 some of these anomalies can be very extensive resulting in bulges in sea level and throwing pendulum clocks out of synchronisation the study of these anomalies forms the basis of gravitational geophysics the fluctuations are measured with highly sensitive gravimeters the effect of topography and other known factors is subtracted and from the resulting data conclusions are drawn such techniques are now used by prospectors to find oil and mineral deposits denser rocks often containing mineral ores cause higher than normal local gravitational fields on the earth s surface less dense sedimentary rocks cause the opposite other factors edit in air objects experience a supporting buoyancy force which reduces the apparent strength of gravity as measured by an object s weight the magnitude of the effect depends on air density and hence air pressure see apparent weight for details the gravitational effects of the moon and the sun also the cause of the tides have a very small effect on the apparent strength of earth s gravity depending on their relative positions typical variations are 2 m s2 0.2 mgal over the course of a day comparative gravities in various cities around the world edit tools exist for calculating the strength of gravity at various cities around the world 13 the effect of latitude can be clearly seen with gravity in high-latitude cities anchorage 9.826 m s2 helsinki 9.825 m s2 being about 0.5 greater than that in cities near the equator kuala lumpur 9.776 m s2 manila 9.780 m s2 the effect of altitude can be seen in mexico city 9.776 m s2 altitude 2,240 metres 7,350 ft and by comparing denver 9.798 m s2 1,616 metres 5,302 ft

centimetre second2 for flat terrain above sea level a second term is added for the gravity due to the extra mass for this purpose the extra mass can be approximated by an infinite horizontal slab and we get 2 g times the mass per unit area i e 4.2 10 10 m3 s 2 kg 1 0.042 gal kg 1 m2 the bouguer correction for a mean rock density of 2.67 g cm 3 this gives 1.1 10 6 s 2 0.11 mgal m 1 combined with the free-air correction this means a reduction of gravity at the surface of ca 2 m s 2 0.20 mgal for every metre of elevation of the terrain the two effects would cancel at a surface rock density of 4 3 times the average density of the whole earth the density of the whole earth is 5.515 g cm 3 so standing on a slab of something like iron whose density is over 7.35 g cm 3 would increase one s weight for the gravity below the surface we have to apply the free-air correction as well as a double bouguer correction with the infinite slab model this is because moving the point of observation below the slab changes the gravity due to it to its opposite alternatively we can consider a spherically symmetrical earth and subtract from the mass of the earth that of the shell outside the point of observation because that does not cause gravity inside this gives the same result estimating g from the law of universal gravitation edit from the law of universal gravitation the force on a body

body see below and here we take m1 to be the mass of the earth and m2 to be the mass of the body additionally newton s second law f ma where m is mass and a is acceleration here tells us that f m 2 g displaystyle f m 2 g comparing the two formulas it is seen that g g m 1 r 2 displaystyle g g frac m 1 r 2 so to find the acceleration due to gravity at sea level substitute the values of the

this formula only works because of the mathematical fact that the gravity of a uniform spherical body as measured on or above its surface is the same as if all its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre this is what allows us to use the earth s radius for r the value obtained agrees approximately with the measured value of g the difference may be attributed to several factors mentioned above under variations the earth is not homogeneous the earth is not a perfect sphere and an average value must be used for its radius this calculated value of g only includes true gravity it does not include the reduction of constraint force that we perceive as a reduction of gravity due to the rotation of earth and some of gravity being counteracted by centrifugal force there are significant uncertainties in the values of r and m1 as used in this calculation and the value of g is also rather difficult to measure precisely if g g and r are known then a reverse calculation will give an estimate of the mass of the earth this method was used by henry cavendish see also edit earth s magnetic field gravity gravitation gravity anomaly bouguer anomaly gravitation of the moon gravitational
