has been found in hydrothermal vent precipitates 1 2 the earliest known life forms on earth are putative fossilized microorganisms found in hydrothermal vent precipitates 1 the earliest time that life forms first appeared on earth is unknown they may have lived earlier than 3.77 billion years ago possibly as early as 4.28 billion years ago 1 not long after the oceans formed 4.41 billion years ago and not long after the formation of the earth 4.54 billion years ago 1 2 3 4 the earliest direct evidence of life on earth are fossils of microorganisms permineralized in 3.465-billion-year-old australian apex chert rocks 5 6 contents 1 overview 2 earliest life forms 3 gallery 4 see also 5 references 6 external links overview edit a life form or lifeform is an entity or being that is living 7 8 earth remains the only place in the universe known to harbor life forms 9 10 more than 99 of all species of life forms amounting to over five billion species 11 that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct 12 13 archaea prokaroytic microbes were first found in extreme environments such as volcanic hot springs some estimates on the number of earth s current species of life forms range from 10 million to 14 million 14 of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described 15 however a may 2016 scientific report estimates that 1 trillion species are currently on earth with only one-thousandth of one percent described 16 the total number of dna base pairs on earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 with a weight of 50 billion tonnes 17 in comparison the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon 18 in july 2016 scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor luca of all organisms living on earth 19 the earth s biosphere includes soil hot springs rock up to 19 km 12 mi or deeper underground the deepest parts of the ocean and at least 64 km 40 mi high into the atmosphere 20 21 22 under certain test conditions life forms have been observed to thrive in the near-weightlessness of space 23 24 and to survive in the vacuum of outer space 25 26 life forms appear to thrive in the mariana trench the deepest spot in the earth s oceans reaching a depth of 11,034 m 36,201 ft 6.856 mi 27 28 29 other researchers reported related studies that life forms thrive inside rocks up to 580 m 1,900 ft 0.36 mi below the sea floor under 2,590 m 8,500 ft 1.61 mi of ocean off the coast of the northwestern united states 28 30 as well as 2,400 m 7,900 ft 1.5 mi beneath the seabed off japan 31 in august 2014 scientists confirmed the existence of life forms living 800 m 2,600 ft 0.50 mi below the ice of antarctica 32 33 according to one researcher you can find microbes everywhere they re extremely adaptable to conditions and survive wherever they are 28 earliest life forms edit fossil evidence informs most studies of the origin of life the age of the earth is about 4.54 billion years 34 35 36 the earliest undisputed evidence of life on earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago 37 38 39 there is evidence that life began much earlier in 2017 fossilized microorganisms or microfossils were announced to have been discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the nuvvuagittuq belt of quebec canada that may be as old as 4.28 billion years old the oldest record of life on earth suggesting an almost instantaneous emergence of life after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago and not long after the formation of the earth 4.54 billion years ago 1 2 3 4 studies suggest that life on earth may have come from biological matter carried by space dust 40 or meteorites 41 remains of life have been found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia 42 evidence of biogenic graphite 43 and possibly stromatolites 44 was discovered in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in southwestern greenland in may 2017 evidence of life on land may have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old geyserite which is often found around hot springs and geysers and other related mineral deposits uncovered in the pilbara craton of western australia 45 46 this complements the november 2013 publication that microbial mat fossils had been found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in western australia 47 48 49 in november 2017 a study by the university of edinburgh suggested that life on earth may have originated from biological particles carried by streams of space dust 40 50 a december 2017 report stated that 3.465-billion-year-old australian apex chert rocks once contained microorganisms the earliest direct evidence of life on earth 5 6 in january 2018 a study found that 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites found on earth contained liquid water along with prebiotic complex organic substances that may be ingredients for life 41 51 according to biologist stephen blair hedges if life arose relatively quickly on earth then it could be common in the universe 42 52 gallery edit stromatolites are made by microbes moving upward to avoid being smothered by sediment stromatolites left behind by cyanobacteria are one of the oldest
