goresat 3 is a noaa space weather and earth observation satellite it was launched by spacex on a falcon 9 launch vehicle on february 11 2015 from cape canaveral 4 it was originally developed as a nasa satellite proposed in 1998 by then-vice president al gore for the purpose of earth observation it is in a lissajous orbit at the sun earth l1 lagrangian point 1.5 million km 930 thousand mi from earth to monitor variable solar wind condition provide early warning of approaching coronal mass ejections and observe phenomena on earth including changes in ozone aerosols dust and volcanic ash cloud height vegetation cover and climate at this location it has a continuous view of the sun and of the sunlit side of the earth the satellite is orbiting the sun earth l1 point in a six-month period with a spacecraft earth sun angle varying from 4 to 15 degrees 5 6 it takes full-earth pictures about every two hours and is able to process them faster than other earth observation satellites 7 dscovr started orbiting around l1 by june 8 2015 just over 100 days after launch 8 after the spacecraft arrived on site and entered its operational phase nasa began releasing near-real time images of earth

columbus s crew to sight land in the americas the satellite s original purpose was to provide a near-continuous view of the entire earth and make that live image available via the internet al gore hoped not only to advance science with these images but also to raise awareness of the earth itself updating the influential blue marble photograph taken by apollo 17 10 in addition to an imaging camera a radiometer would take the first direct measurements of how much sunlight is reflected and emitted from the whole earth albedo this data could constitute a barometer for the process of global warming the scientific goals expanded to measure the amount of solar energy reaching earth cloud patterns weather systems monitor the health of earth s vegetation and track the amount of uv light reaching the surface through the ozone layer in 1999 nasa s inspector general reported that the basic concept of the triana mission was not peer reviewed and triana s added science may not represent the best expenditure of nasa s limited science funding 11 the bush administration put the project on hold shortly after george w bush s inauguration 12 members of the u s congress asked the national academy of sciences whether the project was worthwhile the resulting report released march 2000 stated that the mission was strong and scientifically vital 13 triana was removed from its original launch opportunity on sts-107 the ill-fated columbia mission in 2003 the 100 million satellite remained in storage for the duration of the bush administration in november 2008 the satellite was removed from storage and began recertification for a possible launch on board a delta ii or a falcon 9 14 15 al gore used part of his book our choice 2009 as an attempt to revive debate on the dscovr payload the book mentions legislative efforts by senators barbara mikulski and bill nelson to get the satellite launched 16 nasa renamed the satellite deep space climate observatory dscovr in an attempt to regain support for the project in february 2011 the obama administration attempted to secure funding to re-purpose the dscovr spacecraft as a solar observatory to replace the aging advanced composition explorer ace spacecraft 17 in september 2013 nasa cleared dscovr to proceed to the implementation phase targeting an early 2015 launch 18 which had been announced in december 2012 as launching on a spacex falcon 9 rocket 19 nasa goddard space flight center is providing management and systems engineering to the mission spacecraft edit diagram of dscovr dscovr is built on the smex-lite spacecraft bus and has a launch mass of approximately 570 kg 1,257 lb the main science instrument sets are the sun-observing plasma magnetometer plasmag and the earth-observing nist advanced radiometer nistar and earth polychromatic imaging camera epic dscovr has two deployable solar arrays a propulsion module boom and antenna 20 instruments edit plasmag edit the plasma-magnetometer plasmag measures solar wind for space weather predictions it has three instruments 21 magnetometer measures magnetic field faraday cup measures positively charged particles electrostatic analyzer measures electrons epic edit the first dscovr epic image released by nasa showing the full sunlit earth from nearly one million miles away centered on the americas 22 23 the earth polychromatic imaging camera epic takes images of the sunlit side of earth for various earth science monitoring purposes in 10 different channels from ultraviolet to near-infrared ozone and aerosol levels are monitored along with cloud dynamics properties of the land and vegetations 24 epic has an aperture diameter of 30.5 cm 12 in a focal ratio of 9.38 a field of view of 0.61 and an angular sampling resolution of 1.07 arcseconds earth s apparent diameter varies from 0.45 to 0.53 full width exposure time for each of the 10 narrowband channels 317 325 340 388 443 552 680 688 764 and 779 nm is about 40 ms the camera produces 2048 2048 pixel images but to increase the number of downloadable images to 10 per hour the resolution is averaged to 1024 1024 on board the final resolution is 25 km pixel 16 mi pixel 24 nistar edit national institute of standards and technology advanced radiometer nistar measures irradiance of the sunlit face of the earth this data is to be used to study changes in earth s radiation budget caused by natural and human activities 25 the radiometer measures in four channels for total radiation in ultraviolet visible and infrared in the range 0.2 100 m for reflected solar radiation in ultraviolet visible and near-infrared in the range 0.2 4 m for reflected solar radiation in infrared in the range 0.7 4 m for calibration purposes in the range 0.3 1 m launch edit

days 23 hours 59 minutes 90 post-launch flight test edit spacex planned to conduct a test flight where they would attempt to bring the first stage back through the atmosphere and land the expended first stage on a 90-by-50-meter 300 ft 160 ft floating landing platform 27 28 relative to earlier tests the first-stage return on dscovr was much more challenging especially in atmospheric reentry due to the deep-space nature of the earth sun l1 launch trajectory for dscovr spacex expected deceleration-force loads to be twice as high and rocket heating to quadruple over the reentry conditions on falcon 9 flight 14 29 before the launch the drone ship was in ocean surface conditions that made the barge landing infeasible therefore the landing platform attempt was called off and the first stage made an over-water soft landing instead this continued the collection of returnable first-stage test data on all the earlier phases of the flight test and added data on stage survival following a high-speed high-load atmospheric entry 30 operation edit on july 6 2015 dscovr returned its first publicly released view of the entire sunlit side of earth from 1,475,207 km 916,651 mi away taken by the epic instrument epic provides a daily series of earth images enabling the first-time study of daily variations over the entire globe the images available 12 to 36 hours after they are made have been posted to a dedicated web page since september 2015 22 23 dscovr was placed in operation at the l1 lagrangian point to monitor the sun because the constant stream of particles from the sun the solar wind reaches l1 about 60 minutes before reaching earth dscovr will usually be able to provide a 15- to 60-minute warning before a surge of particles and magnetic field from a coronal mass ejection cme reaches earth and creates a geomagnetic storm dscovr data will also be used to improve predictions of the impact locations of a geomagnetic storm to be able to take preventative action electronic technologies such as satellites in geosynchronous orbit are at risk of unplanned disruptions without warnings from dscovr and other monitoring satellites at l1 31 on july 16 17 2015 dscovr took a series of images showing the moon engaged in a transit of earth the images were taken between 19 50 and 00 45 utc the animation was composed of monochrome images taken in different color filters at 30-second intervals for each frame resulting in a slight color fringing for the moon in each finished frame due to its position at sun earth l1 dscovr will always see the moon illuminated and will always see its far side when it passes in front of earth 32 on october 19 2015 nasa opened a new website to host near-live blue marble images taken by epic of earth 9 at least twelve images are released each day at regular intervals showcasing the earth as it rotates on its axis 33 the resolution of the images ranges from 10 to 15 km per pixel 6.2 to 9.4 mi pixel and the short exposure times renders points of starlight invisible 33 animations edit the moon transiting earth july 16 2015 earth depicted with its 23.4 tilt the cause of the seasons on epic s 268th day of operation
