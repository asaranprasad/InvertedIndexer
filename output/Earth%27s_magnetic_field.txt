normal polarity between reversals 1 the lines represent magnetic field lines blue when the field points towards the center and yellow when away the rotation axis of the earth is centered and vertical the dense clusters of lines are within the earth s core 2 earth s magnetic field is also known as the geomagnetic field is the magnetic field that extends from the earth s interior out into space where it meets the solar wind a stream of charged particles emanating from the sun its magnitude at the earth s surface ranges from 25 to 65 microteslas 0.25 to 0.65 gauss 3 roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to earth s rotational axis as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle at the center of the earth the north geomagnetic pole located near greenland in the northern hemisphere is actually the south pole of the earth s magnetic field and the south geomagnetic pole is the north pole the magnetic field is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of molten iron in the earth s outer core driven by heat escaping from the core a natural process called a geodynamo while the north and south magnetic poles are usually located near the geographic poles they can wander widely over geological time scales but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation however at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years the earth s field reverses and the north and south magnetic poles relatively abruptly switch places these reversals of the geomagnetic poles leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors in the process of plate tectonics the magnetosphere is the region above the ionosphere that is defined by the extent of the earth s magnetic field in space it extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space protecting the earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere including the

magnetic field serves to deflect most of the solar wind whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation 4 one stripping mechanism is for gas to be caught in bubbles of magnetic field which are ripped off by solar winds 5 calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of mars resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere 6 7 the study of past magnetic field of the earth is known as paleomagnetism 8 the polarity of the earth s magnetic field is recorded in igneous rocks and reversals of the field are thus detectable as stripes centered on mid-ocean ridges where the sea floor is spreading while the stability of the geomagnetic poles between reversals has allowed paleomagnetists to track the past motion of continents reversals also provide the basis for magnetostratigraphy a way of dating rocks and sediments 9 the field also magnetizes the crust and magnetic anomalies can be used to search for deposits of metal ores 10 humans have used compasses for direction finding since the 11th century a d and for navigation since the 12th century 11 although the magnetic declination does shift with time this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for navigation using magnetoception various other organisms ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons use the earth s magnetic field for orientation and navigation main characteristics edit description edit at any location the earth s magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector a typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic north its angle relative to true north is the declination d or variation facing magnetic north the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the inclination i or magnetic dip the intensity f of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet another common representation is in x north y east and z down coordinates 12 common coordinate systems used for representing the earth s magnetic field intensity edit the intensity of the field is often measured in gauss g but is generally reported in nanoteslas nt with 1 g 100,000 nt a nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma 13 the tesla is the si unit of the magnetic field b the earth s field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000 nt 0.25 0.65 g by comparison a strong refrigerator magnet has a field of about 10,000,000 nanoteslas 100 g 14 a map of intensity contours is called an isodynamic chart as the world magnetic model shows the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator a minimum intensity occurs in the south atlantic anomaly over south america while there are maxima over northern canada siberia and the coast of antarctica south of australia 15 inclination edit the inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90 up to 90 down in the northern hemisphere the field points downwards it is straight down at the north magnetic pole and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal 0 at the magnetic equator it continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the south magnetic pole inclination can be measured with a dip circle an isoclinic chart map of inclination contours for the earth s magnetic field is shown below declination edit declination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north it can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north south heading on a compass with the direction of a celestial pole maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination geographical variation edit components of the earth s magnetic field at the surface from the world magnetic model for 2015 15 intensity inclination declination dipolar approximation edit the variation between magnetic north n m and true north n g near the surface of the earth its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the earth and tilted at an angle of about 11 with respect to the rotational axis of the earth 13 the dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic north pole 16 this may seem surprising but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because if allowed to rotate freely it points roughly northward in the geographic sense since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles it must be attracted to the south pole of earth s magnet the dipolar field accounts for 80 90 of the field in most locations 12 magnetic poles edit the movement of earth s north magnetic pole across the canadian arctic historically the north and south poles of a magnet were first defined by the earth s magnetic field not vice versa since one of the first uses for a magnet was as a compass needle its north pole was defined as the pole that would be attracted by the earth s north magnetic pole when the magnet was suspended so it could turn freely since opposite poles attract the north magnetic pole of the earth is really the south pole of its magnetic field the place where the field is directed downward into the earth 17 18 19 20 the positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways locally or globally 21 the local definition is the point where the magnetic field is vertical 22 this can be determined by measuring the inclination the inclination of the earth s field is 90 downwards at the north magnetic pole and -90 upwards at the south magnetic pole the two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe they can migrate rapidly movements of up to 40 kilometres 25 mi per year have been observed for the north magnetic pole over the last 180 years the north magnetic pole has been migrating northwestward from cape adelaide in the boothia peninsula in 1831 to 600 kilometres 370 mi from resolute bay in 2001 23 the magnetic equator is the line where the inclination is zero the magnetic field is horizontal the global definition of the earth s field is based on a mathematical model if a line is drawn through the center of the earth parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole the two positions where it intersects the earth s surface are called the north and south geomagnetic poles if the earth s magnetic field were perfectly dipolar the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them however the earth s field has a significant non-dipolar contribution so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either magnetosphere edit an artist s rendering of the structure of a magnetosphere 1 bow shock 2 magnetosheath 3 magnetopause 4 magnetosphere 5 northern tail lobe 6 southern tail lobe 7 plasmasphere earth s magnetic field predominantly dipolar at its surface is distorted further out by the solar wind this is a stream of charged particles leaving the sun s corona and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000 kilometres per second they carry with them a magnetic field the interplanetary magnetic field imf 24 the solar wind exerts a pressure and if it could reach earth s atmosphere it would erode it however it is kept away by the pressure of the earth s magnetic field the magnetopause the area where the pressures balance is the boundary of the magnetosphere despite its name the magnetosphere is asymmetric with the sunward side being about 10 earth radii out but the other side stretching out in a magnetotail that extends beyond 200 earth radii 25 sunward of the magnetopause is the bow shock the area where the solar wind slows abruptly 24 inside the magnetosphere is the plasmasphere a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles or plasma this region begins at a height of 60 km extends up to 3 or 4 earth radii and includes the ionosphere this region rotates with the earth 25 there are also two concentric tire-shaped regions called the van allen radiation belts with high-energy ions energies from 0.1 to 10 million electron volts mev the inner belt is 1 2 earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4 7 earth radii the plasmasphere and van allen belts have partial overlap with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity 26 as well as deflecting the solar wind the earth s magnetic field deflects cosmic rays high-energy charged particles that are mostly from outside the solar system many cosmic rays are kept out of the solar system by the sun s magnetosphere or heliosphere 27 by contrast astronauts on the moon risk exposure to radiation anyone who had been on the moon s surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose 24 some of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere these spiral around field lines bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second in addition positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward giving rise to a ring current this current reduces the magnetic field at the earth s surface 24 particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit x-rays 25 the varying conditions in the magnetosphere known as space weather are largely driven by solar activity if the solar wind is weak the magnetosphere expands while if it is strong it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in periods of particularly intense activity called geomagnetic storms can occur when a coronal mass ejection erupts above the sun and sends a shock wave through the solar system such a wave can take just two days to reach the earth geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption the halloween storm of 2003 damaged more than a third of nasa s satellites the largest documented storm occurred in 1859 it induced currents strong enough to short out telegraph lines and aurorae were reported as far south as hawaii 24 28 time dependence edit short-term variations edit background a set of traces from magnetic observatories showing a magnetic storm in 2000 globe map showing locations of observatories and contour lines giving horizontal magnetic intensity in t the geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere ionospheric dynamo region and magnetosphere and some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the earth s interior particularly the iron-rich core 12 frequently the earth s magnetosphere is hit by solar flares causing geomagnetic storms provoking displays of aurorae the short-term instability of the magnetic field is measured with the k-index 29 data from themis show that the magnetic field which interacts with the solar wind is reduced when the magnetic orientation is aligned between sun and earth opposite to the previous hypothesis during forthcoming solar storms this could result in blackouts and disruptions in artificial satellites 30 secular variation edit estimated declination contours by year 1590 to 1990 click to see variation strength of the axial dipole component of earth s magnetic field from 1600 to 2020 changes in earth s magnetic field on a time scale of a year or more are referred to as secular variation over hundreds of years magnetic declination is observed to vary over tens of degrees 12 a movie on the right shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries 31 the direction and intensity of the dipole change over time over the last two centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about 6.3 per century 12 at this rate of decrease the field would be negligible in about 1600 years 32 however this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years and the current rate of change is not unusual 33 a prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a westward drift at a rate of about 0.2 degrees per year 32 this drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time the globally averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 ad but eastward between about 1000 ad and 1400 ad 34 changes that predate magnetic observatories are recorded in archaeological and geological materials such changes are referred to as paleomagnetic secular variation or paleosecular variation psv the records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic excursions and reversals 35 magnetic field reversals edit geomagnetic polarity during the late cenozoic era dark areas denote periods where the polarity matches today s polarity light areas denote periods where that polarity is reversed although generally earth s field is approximately dipolar with an axis that is nearly aligned with the rotational axis occasionally the north and south geomagnetic poles trade places evidence for these geomagnetic reversals can be found in basalts sediment cores taken from the ocean floors and seafloor magnetic anomalies 36 reversals occur nearly randomly in time with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years the most recent geomagnetic reversal called the brunhes matuyama reversal occurred about 780,000 years ago 23 37 a related phenomenon a geomagnetic excursion amounts to an incomplete reversal with no change in polarity 38 39 the laschamp event is an example of an excursion it having occurred during the last ice age 41,000 years ago the past magnetic field is recorded mostly by strongly magnetic minerals particularly iron oxides such as magnetite that can carry a permanent magnetic moment this remanent magnetization or remanence can be acquired in more than one way in lava flows the direction of the field is frozen in small minerals as they cool giving rise to a thermoremanent magnetization in sediments the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom this is called detrital remanent magnetization 8 thermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around mid-ocean ridges as the seafloor spreads magma wells up from the mantle cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading as it cools it records the direction of the earth s field when the earth s field reverses new basalt records the reversed direction the result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge a ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below this provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past 8 radiometric dating of lava flows has been used to establish a geomagnetic polarity time scale part of which is shown in the image this forms the basis of magnetostratigraphy a geophysical correlation technique that can be used to date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies 8 studies of lava flows on steens mountain oregon indicate that the magnetic field could have shifted at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day at some time in earth s history which significantly challenges the popular understanding of how the earth s magnetic field works 40 this finding was later attributed to unusual rock magnetic properties of the lava flow under study not rapid field change by one of the original authors of the 1995 study 41 temporary dipole tilt variations that take the dipole axis across the equator and then back to the original polarity are known as excursions 39 earliest appearance edit paleomagnetic studies of paleoarchean lava in australia and conglomerate in south africa have concluded that the magnetic field has been present since at least about million years ago 42 43 44 future edit variations in virtual axial dipole moment since the last reversal at present the overall geomagnetic field is becoming weaker the present strong deterioration corresponds to a 10 15 decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated in the past several years geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35 above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago the rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks the nature of earth s magnetic field is one of heteroscedastic fluctuation an instantaneous measurement of it or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength it has gone up and down in the past for unknown reasons also noting the local intensity of the dipole field or its fluctuation is insufficient to characterize earth s magnetic field as a whole as it is not strictly a dipole field the dipole component of earth s field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases the earth s magnetic north pole is drifting from northern canada towards siberia with a presently accelerating rate 10 kilometres 6.2 mi per year at the beginning of the 20th century up to 40 kilometres 25 mi per year in 2003 23 and since then has only accelerated 45 physical origin edit the earth s magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in the conductive material of its core created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core however the process is complex and computer models that reproduce some of its features have only been developed in the last few decades earth s core and the geodynamo edit a schematic illustrating the relationship between motion of conducting fluid organized into rolls by the coriolis force and the magnetic field the motion generates 46 the earth and most of the planets in the solar system as well as the sun and other stars all generate magnetic fields through the motion of electrically conducting fluids 47 the earth s field originates in its core this is a region of iron alloys extending to about 3400 km the radius of the earth is 6370 km it is divided into a solid inner core with a radius of 1220 km and a liquid outer core 48 the motion of the liquid in the outer core is driven by heat flow from the inner core which is about 6,000 k 5,730 c 10,340 f to the core-mantle boundary which is about 3,800 k 3,530 c 6,380 f 49 the pattern of flow is organized by the rotation of the earth and the presence of the solid inner core 50 the mechanism by which the earth generates a magnetic field is known as a dynamo 47 the magnetic field is generated by a feedback loop current loops generate magnetic fields amp re s circuital law a changing magnetic field generates an electric field faraday s law and the electric and magnetic fields exert a force on the charges that are flowing in currents the lorentz force 51 these effects can be combined in a partial differential equation for the magnetic field called the magnetic induction equation b t 2 b u b displaystyle frac partial mathbf b partial t eta nabla 2 mathbf b nabla times mathbf u times mathbf b where u is the velocity of the fluid b is the magnetic b-field and 1 is the magnetic diffusivity which is inversely proportional to the product of the electrical conductivity and the permeability 52 the term b t is the time derivative of the field 2 is the laplace operator and is the curl operator the first term on the right hand side of the induction equation is a diffusion term in a stationary fluid the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out if the earth s dynamo shut off the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years 52 in a perfect conductor displaystyle sigma infty there would be no diffusion by lenz s law any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change as the fluid moved the magnetic field would go with it the theorem describing this effect is called the frozen-in-field theorem even in a fluid with a finite conductivity new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it this process could go on generating new field indefinitely were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength it resists fluid motion 52 the motion of the fluid is sustained by convection motion driven by buoyancy the temperature increases towards the center of the earth and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant this buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation as the core cools some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core in the process lighter elements are left behind in the fluid making it lighter this is called compositional convection a coriolis effect caused by the overall planetary rotation tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis 50 52 a dynamo can amplify a magnetic field but it needs a seed field to get it started 52 for the earth this could have been an external magnetic field early in its history the sun went through a t-tauri phase in which the solar wind would have had a magnetic field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind 53 however much of the field may have been screened out by the earth s mantle an alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity such effects may still provide a small bias that are part of the boundary conditions for the geodynamo 54 the average magnetic field in the earth s outer core was calculated to be 25 gausses 50 times stronger than the field at the surface 55 numerical models edit simulating the geodynamo requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics mhd of the earth s interior simulation of the mhd equations is performed on a 3d grid of points and the fineness of the grid which in part determines the realism of the solutions is limited mainly by computer power for decades theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo 56 the first self-consistent dynamo models ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field were developed by two groups in 1995 one in japan 57 and one in the united states 1 58 the latter received attention because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the earth s field including geomagnetic reversals 56 currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere edit electric currents induced in the ionosphere generate magnetic fields ionospheric dynamo region such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the sun causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields by as much as one degree typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas nt one part in 2000 with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nt one part in 50,000 59 measurement and analysis edit detection edit the earth s magnetic field strength was measured by carl friedrich gauss in 1832 60 and has been repeatedly measured since then showing a relative decay of about 10 over the last 150 years 61 the magsat satellite and later satellites have used 3-axis vector magnetometers to probe the 3-d structure of the earth s magnetic field the later rsted satellite allowed a comparison indicating a dynamic geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an alternate pole under the atlantic ocean west of s africa 62 governments sometimes operate units that specialize in measurement of the earth s magnetic field these are geomagnetic observatories typically part of a national geological survey for example the british geological survey s eskdalemuir observatory such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications electric power and other human activities the international real-time magnetic observatory network with over 100 interlinked geomagnetic observatories around the world has been recording the earths magnetic field since 1991 the military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics in order to detect anomalies in the natural background that might be caused by a significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine typically these magnetic anomaly detectors are flown in aircraft like the uk s nimrod or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships commercially geophysical prospecting companies also use magnetic detectors to identify naturally occurring anomalies from ore bodies such as the kursk magnetic anomaly crustal magnetic anomalies edit a model of short-wavelength features of earth s magnetic field attributed to lithospheric anomalies 63 magnetometers detect minute deviations in the earth s magnetic field caused by iron artifacts kilns some types of stone structures and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during world war ii to detect submarines 64 the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped basalt the iron-rich volcanic rock making up the ocean floor 65 contains a strongly magnetic mineral magnetite and can locally distort compass readings the distortion was recognized by icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century 66 more important because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor when newly formed rock cools such magnetic materials record the earth s magnetic field 66 statistical models edit each measurement of the magnetic field is at a particular place and time if an accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed the measurements must be converted to a model and the model used to make predictions spherical harmonics edit schematic representation of spherical harmonics on a sphere and their nodal lines p m is equal to 0 along m great circles passing through the poles and along -m circles of equal latitude the function changes sign each time it crosses one of these lines example of a quadrupole field this can also be constructed by moving two dipoles together the most common way of analyzing the global variations in the earth s magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of spherical harmonics this was first done by carl friedrich gauss 67 spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere they are the product of two functions one that depends on latitude and one on longitude the function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the north and south poles the number of such nodal lines is the absolute value of the order m the function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles this plus the order is equal to the degree each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the earth a monopole is an isolated magnetic charge which has never been observed a dipole is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a quadrupole to two dipoles brought together a quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right 12 spherical harmonics can represent any scalar field function of position that satisfies certain properties a magnetic field is a vector field but if it is expressed in cartesian components x y z each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the magnetic potential analyses of the earth s magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor a least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the earth s field as the sum of spherical harmonics each multiplied by the best-fitting gauss coefficient gm or hm 12 the lowest-degree gauss coefficient g00 gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge so it is zero the next three coefficients g10 g11 and h11 determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution the best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10 with respect to the rotational axis as described earlier 12 radial dependence edit spherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height for example ground observatories and satellites in that case each term with coefficient gm or hm can be split into two terms one that decreases with radius as 1 r 1 and one that increases with radius as r the increasing terms fit the external sources currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere however averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero 12 the remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source 1 drops off as 1 r2 the magnetic field being a derivative of the potential drops off as 1 r3 quadrupole terms drop off as 1 r4 and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius the radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the earth if the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface the quadrupole part by a factor of 16 and so on thus only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface from a variety of arguments it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree 14 or less have their origin in the core these have wavelengths of about 2,000 kilometres 1,200 mi or less smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies 12 global models edit the international association of geomagnetism and aeronomy maintains a standard global field model called the international geomagnetic reference field it is updated every 5 years the 11th-generation model igrf11 was developed using data from satellites rsted champ and sac-c and a world network of geomagnetic observatories 68 the spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree 10 with 120 coefficients until 2000 subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 195 coefficients 69 another global field model called the world magnetic model is produced jointly by the united states national centers for environmental information formerly the national geophysical data center and the british geological survey this model truncates at degree 12 168 coefficients with an approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers it is the model used by the united states department of defense the ministry of defence united kingdom the united states federal aviation administration faa the north atlantic treaty organization nato and the international hydrographic office as well as in many civilian navigation systems 70 a third model produced by the goddard space flight center nasa and gsfc and the danish space research institute uses a comprehensive modeling approach that attempts to reconcile data with greatly varying temporal and spatial resolution from ground and satellite sources 71 for users with higher accuracy needs the united states national centers for environmental information developed the enhanced magnetic model emm which extends to degree and order 720 and resolves magnetic anomalies down to a wavelength of 56 kilometers it was compiled from satellite marine aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys the latest version emm2015 includes data from the european space agency s swarm satellite mission 72 biomagnetism edit animals including birds and turtles can detect the earth s magnetic field and use the field to navigate during migration 73 some researchers have found that cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines suggesting that magnetism is responsible 74 75 other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different google earth images 76 researchers found out that very weak electromagnetic fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by european robins and other songbirds to navigate using the earth s magnetic field neither power lines nor cellphone signals are to blame for the electromagnetic field effect on the birds according to the new study published in the 8 may 2014 edition of the journal nature instead the culprits consist of frequencies between 2 khz and 5 mhz such as am radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes 77 see also edit book geomagnetism van allen radiation belt thermal history of the earth geomagnetic jerk geomagnetic latitude history of geomagnetism magnetic field of the
