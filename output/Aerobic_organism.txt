https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism aerobic organism from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be identified by growing them in test tubes of thioglycollate broth 1 obligate aerobes need oxygen because they cannot ferment or respire anaerobically they gather at the top of the tube where the oxygen concentration is highest 2 obligate anaerobes are poisoned by oxygen so they gather at the bottom of the tube where the oxygen concentration is lowest 3 facultative anaerobes can grow with or without oxygen because they can metabolise energy aerobically or anaerobically they gather mostly at the top because aerobic respiration generates more atp than either fermentation or anaerobic respiration 4 microaerophiles need oxygen because they cannot ferment or respire anaerobically however they are poisoned by high concentrations of oxygen they gather in the upper part of the test tube but not the very top 5 aerotolerant organisms do not require oxygen as they metabolise energy anaerobically unlike obligate anaerobes however they are not poisoned by oxygen they can be found evenly spread throughout the test tube an aerobic organism or aerobe is an organism that can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment 1 in contrast an anaerobic organism anaerobe is any organism that does not require oxygen for growth some anaerobes react negatively or even die if oxygen is present 2 contents 1 types 2 glucose 3 see also 4 references types edit obligate aerobes need oxygen to grow in a process known as cellular respiration these organisms use oxygen to oxidize substrates for example sugars and fats and generate energy 3 facultative anaerobes use oxygen if it is available but also have anaerobic methods of energy production 2 microaerophiles require oxygen for energy production but are harmed by atmospheric concentrations of oxygen 21 o2 3 aerotolerant anaerobes do not use oxygen but are not harmed by it 3 when an organism is able to survive in both oxygen and anaerobic environments the use of the pasteur effect can distinguish between facultative anaerobes and aerotolerant organisms if the organism is using fermentation in an anaerobic environment the addition of oxygen will cause facultative anaerobes to suspend fermentation and begin using oxygen for respiration aerotolerant organisms must continue fermentation in the presence of oxygen glucose edit a good example is the oxidation of glucose a monosaccharide in aerobic respiration c 6h 12o 6 6 o 2 38 adp 38 phosphate 6 co 2 6 h 2o 38 atp oxygen is used during the oxidation of glucose and water is produced 2 this equation is a summary of what happens in three series of biochemical reactions glycolysis the krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation see also edit aerobic digestion anaerobic digestion fermentation biochemistry aerobic vaginitis oxygenation environmental references edit at dorland s medical dictionary a b c hentges dj 1996 17 anaerobes general characteristics in baron s 4 ed galveston texas university of texas medical branch at galveston retrieved 24 july 2016 a b c kenneth todar nutrition and growth of bacteria p 4 retrieved 24 july 2016 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title aerobic organism oldid 817310295 categories cellular respiration microbiology hidden categories use dmy dates from july 2013 navigation menu search this page was last edited on 27 december 2017 at 15 20 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
