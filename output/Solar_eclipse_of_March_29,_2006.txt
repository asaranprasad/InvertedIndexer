agency the astronomical society of the pacific as well as dozens of tour groups met at the apollo temple and the theater in side turkey the san francisco exploratorium featured a live webcast from the site where thousands of observers were seated in the ancient roman-style theater 1 almost all actively visited areas in the path of totality had perfect weather many observers reported an unusually beautiful eclipse with many or all effects visible and a very nice corona despite the proximity to the solar minimum the partial phase of the eclipse was also visible from the international space station where the astronauts on board took spectacular pictures of the moon s shadow on earth s surface it initially appeared as though an orbit correction set for the middle of march would bring the iss into the path of totality but this correction was postponed gallery edit sahara libya 12 11 local time 10 11 utc valencia spain 12 16 local time 10 16 utc smolyan bulgaria 13 30 local time 10 30

network television a new zealand pay tv company failed the day after this eclipse at around 1900 local time while sky didn t directly attribute the failure to the eclipse they said in a media release that it took longer to resolve the issue because of it but this claim was refuted by astronomers the main reason for the failure was because of an aging and increasingly faulty satellite 2 related
