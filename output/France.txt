culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established which by the 20th century would be the second largest in the world 11 the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between catholics and protestants huguenots france became europe s dominant cultural political and military power under louis xiv 12 in the late 18th century the french revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy established one of modern history s earliest republics and saw the drafting of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen which expresses the nation s ideals to this day in the

tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the french third republic in 1870 france was a major participant in world war i from which it emerged victorious and was one of the allied powers in world war ii but came under occupation by the axis powers in 1940 following liberation in 1944 a fourth republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the

francia or country of the franks 21 modern france is still named today francia in italian and spanish frankreich in german and frankrijk in dutch all of which have the same historical meaning there are various theories as to the origin of the name frank following the precedents of edward gibbon and jacob grimm 22 the name of the franks has been linked with the word frank free in english 23 it has been suggested that the meaning of free was adopted because after the conquest of gaul only franks were free of taxation 24 another theory is that it is derived from the proto-germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the franks was known as a francisca 25 however it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the franks not the other way around 26 history prehistory before the 6th century bc one of the lascaux paintings a horse dordogne approximately 18,000 bc the oldest traces of human life in what is now france date from approximately 1.8 million years ago 27 humans were then confronted by a harsh and variable climate marked by several glacial eras early homonids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life 27 france has a large number of decorated caves from the upper palaeolithic era including one of the most famous and best preserved lascaux 27 approximately 18,000 bc at the end of the last glacial period 10,000 bc the climate became milder 27 from approximately 7,000 bc this part of western europe entered the neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary after strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium initially working gold copper and bronze and later iron 28 france has numerous megalithic sites from the neolithic period including the exceptionally dense carnac stones site approximately 3,300 bc antiquity 6th century bc 5th century ad in 600 bc ionian greeks originating from phocaea founded the colony of massalia present-day marseille on the shores of the mediterranean sea this makes it france s oldest city 29 30 at the same time some gallic celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of france and this occupation spread to the rest of france between the 5th and 3rd century bc 31 the maison carr e was a temple of the gallo-roman city of nemausus present-day n mes and is one of the best-preserved vestiges of the roman empire the concept of gaul emerged at that time it corresponds to the territories of celtic settlement ranging between the rhine the atlantic ocean the pyrenees and the mediterranean the borders of modern france are roughly the same as those of ancient gaul which was inhabited by celtic gauls gaul was then a prosperous country of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to greek and roman cultural and economic influences around 390 bc the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to italy through the alps defeated the romans in the battle of the allia and besieged and ransomed rome the gallic invasion left rome weakened and the gauls continued to harass the region until 345 bc when they entered into a formal peace treaty with rome but the romans and the gauls would remain adversaries for the next several centuries and the gauls would continue to be a threat in italia around 125 bc the south of gaul was conquered by the romans who called this region provincia nostra our province which over time evolved into the name provence in french 32 julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in 52 bc 33 gaul was divided by augustus into roman provinces 34 many cities were founded during the gallo-roman period including lugdunum present-day lyon which is considered the capital of the gauls 34 these cities were built in traditional roman style with a forum a theatre a circus an amphitheatre and thermal baths the gauls mixed with roman settlers and eventually adopted roman culture and roman speech latin from which the french language evolved the roman polytheism merged with the gallic paganism into the same syncretism from the 250s to the 280s ad roman gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians 35 nevertheless the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century which was a period of revival and prosperity for roman gaul 36 in 312 the emperor constantin i converted to christianity subsequently christians who had been persecuted until then increased rapidly across the entire roman empire 37 but from the beginning of the 5th century the barbarian invasions resumed 38 and germanic tribes such as the vandals suebi and alans crossed the rhine and settled in gaul spain and other parts of the collapsing roman empire 39 early middle ages 5th century 10th century frankish expansion from 481 to 843 870 at the end of the antiquity period ancient gaul was divided into several germanic kingdoms and a remaining gallo-roman territory known as the kingdom of syagrius simultaneously celtic britons fleeing the anglo-saxon settlement of britain settled the western part of armorica as a result the armorican peninsula was renamed brittany celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region with clovis s conversion to catholicism in 498 the frankish monarchy elective and secular until then became hereditary and of divine right the pagan franks from whom the ancient name of francie was derived originally settled the north part of gaul but under clovis i conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central gaul in 498 clovis i was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity rather than arianism thus france was given the title eldest daughter of the church french la fille a n e de l glise by the papacy 40 and french kings would be called the most christian kings of france rex christianissimus the franks embraced the christian gallo-roman culture and ancient gaul was eventually renamed francia land of the franks the germanic franks adopted romanic languages except in northern gaul where roman settlements were less dense and where germanic languages emerged clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death the franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs so four kingdoms emerged from clovis s paris orl ans soissons and rheims the last merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace head of household one mayor of the palace charles martel defeated an islamic invasion of gaul at the battle of tours 732 and earned respect and power within the frankish kingdoms his son pepin the short seized the crown of francia from the weakened merovingians and founded the carolingian dynasty pepin s son charlemagne reunited the frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across western and central europe proclaimed holy roman emperor by pope leo iii and thus establishing in earnest the french government s longtime historical association with the catholic church 41 charlemagne tried to revive the western roman empire and its cultural grandeur charlemagne s son louis i emperor 814 840 kept the empire united however this carolingian empire would not survive his death in 843 under the treaty of verdun the empire was divided between louis three sons with east francia going to louis the german middle francia to lothair i and west francia to charles the bald west francia approximated the area occupied by and was the precursor to modern france 42 during the 9th and 10th centuries continually threatened by viking invasions france became a very decentralised state the nobility s titles and lands became hereditary and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen thus was established feudalism in france over time some of the king s vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king for example after the battle of hastings in 1066 william the conqueror added king of england to his titles becoming both the vassal to as duke of normandy and the equal of as king of england the king of france creating recurring tensions late middle ages 10th century 15th century joan of arc led the french army to several important victories during the hundred years war which paved the way for the final victory french territorial evolution from 985 to 1947 the carolingian dynasty ruled france until 987 when hugh capet duke of france and count of paris was crowned king of the franks 43 his descendants the capetians the house of valois and the house of bourbon progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the kingdom of france which was fully declared in 1190 by philip ii augustus the french nobility played a prominent role in most crusades in order to restore christian access to the holy land french knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the crusades in such a fashion that the arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as franj caring little whether they really came from france 44 the french crusaders also imported the french language into the levant making french the base of the lingua franca litt frankish language of the crusader states 44 french knights also made up the majority in both the hospital and the temple orders the latter in particular held numerous properties throughout france and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the french crown until philip iv annihilated the order in 1307 the albigensian crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day france in the end the cathars were exterminated and the autonomous county of toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of france 45 later kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental france including most of the north centre and west of france meanwhile the royal authority became more and more assertive centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility clergy and commoners charles iv the fair died without an heir in 1328 46 under the rules of the salic law the crown of france could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line 46 accordingly the crown passed to philip of valois a cousin of charles rather than through the female line to charles nephew edward who would soon become edward iii of england during the reign of philip of valois the french monarchy reached the height of its medieval power 46 philip s seat on the throne was contested by edward iii of england and in 1337 on the eve of the first wave of the black death 47 england and france went to war in what would become known as the hundred years war 48 the exact boundaries changed greatly with time but french landholdings of the english kings remained extensive for decades with charismatic leaders such as joan of arc and la hire strong french counterattacks won back english continental territories like the rest of europe france was struck by the black death half of the 17 million population of france died 49 50 early modern period 15th century 1789 main articles french renaissance c 1400 c 1650 early modern france 1500 1789 french wars of religion 1562 1598 and ancien r gime c 1400 1792 the st bartholomew s day massacre 1572 was the climax of the french wars of religion which were brought to an end by the edict of nantes 1598 the french renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the french language which would become the official language of france and the language of europe s aristocracy it also saw a long set of wars known as the italian wars between the kingdom of france and the powerful holy roman empire french explorers such as jacques cartier or samuel de champlain claimed lands in the americas for france paving the way for the expansion of the first french colonial empire the rise of protestantism in europe led france to a civil war known as the french wars of religion where in the most notorious incident thousands of huguenots were murdered in the st bartholomew s day massacre of 1572 51 the wars of religion were ended by henry iv s edict of nantes which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots under louis xiii the energetic cardinal richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s he systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence dueling carrying weapons and maintaining private army by the end of 1620s richelieu established the royal monopoly of force as the doctrine 52 during louis xiv s minority and the regency of queen anne and cardinal mazarin a period of trouble known as the fronde occurred in france which was at that time at war with spain this rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in france louis xiv the sun king was the absolute monarch of france and made france the leading european power the monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of louis xiv by turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the palace of versailles louis xiv s personal power became unchallenged remembered for his numerous wars he made france the leading european power france became the most populous country in europe and had tremendous influence over european politics economy and culture french became the most-used language in diplomacy science literature and international affairs and remained so until the 20th century 53 france obtained many overseas possessions in the americas africa and asia louis xiv also revoked the edict of nantes forcing thousands of huguenots into exile under louis xv louis xiv s great-grandson france lost new france and most of its indian possessions after its defeat in the seven years war which ended in 1763 its european territory kept growing however with notable acquisitions such as lorraine 1766 and corsica 1770 an unpopular king louis xv s weak rule his ill-advised financial political and military decisions as well as the debauchery of his court discredited the monarchy which arguably paved the way for the french revolution 15 years after his death 54 55 louis xvi louis xv s grandson actively supported the americans who were seeking their independence from great britain realised in the treaty of paris 1783 the financial crisis that followed france s involvement in the american revolutionary war was one of many contributing factors to the french revolution much of the enlightenment occurred in french intellectual circles and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions such as the discovery of oxygen 1778 and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers 1783 were achieved by french scientists french explorers such as bougainville and lap rouse took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe the enlightenment philosophy in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the french revolution revolutionary france 1789 1799 the storming of the bastille on 14 july 1789 was the most emblematic event of the french revolution facing financial troubles king louis xvi summoned the estates-general gathering the three estates of the realm in may 1789 to propose solutions to his government as it came to an impasse the representatives of the third estate formed into a national assembly signalling the outbreak of the french revolution fearing that the king would suppress the newly created national assembly insurgents stormed the bastille on 14 july 1789 a date which would become france s national day in early august 1789 the national constituent assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights through the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen 27 august 1789 france established fundamental rights for men the declaration affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of man to liberty property security and resistance to oppression freedom of speech and press were declared and arbitrary arrests outlawed it called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth in november 1789 the assembly decided to nationalize and sell all property of the roman catholic church which had been the largest landowner in the country in july 1790 a civil constitution of the clergy reorganised the french catholic church cancelling the authority of the church to levy taxes et cetera this fueled much discontent in parts of france which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later while king louis xvi still enjoyed popularity among the population his disastrous flight to varennes june 1791 seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion his credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility in august 1791 the emperor of austria and the king of prussia in the declaration of pillnitz threatened revolutionary france to intervene by force of arms to restore the french absolute monarchy in september 1791 the national constituent assembly forced king louis xvi to accept the french constitution of 1791 thus turning the french absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy in the newly established legislative assembly october 1791 enmity developed and deepened between a group later called the girondins who favored war with austria and prussia and a group later called montagnards or jacobins who opposed such a war but a majority in the assembly in 1792 saw a war with austria and prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government and thought that france would win a war against those gathered monarchies on 20 april 1792 therefore they declared war on austria xiv on 10 august 1792 an angry crowd threatened the palace of king louis xvi who took refuge in the legislative assembly 56 57 a prussian army invaded france later in august 1792 in early september parisians infuriated by the prussian army capturing verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of france murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners by raiding the parisian prisons the assembly and the paris city council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed 56 58 the national convention chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage 56 on 20 september 1792 succeeded the legislative assembly and on 21 september abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the french first republic ex-king louis xvi was convicted of treason and guillotined in january 1793 france had declared war on england and the dutch republic in november 1792 and did the same on spain in march 1793 in the spring of 1793 austria great britain and the dutch republic invaded france in march france created a sister republic in the republic of mainz also in march 1793 the civil war of the vend e against paris started evoked by both the civil constitution of the clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription early 1793 elsewhere in france rebellion was brewing too a factionalist feud in the national convention smoldering ever since october 1791 came to a climax with the group of the girondins on 2 june 1793 being forced to resign and leave the convention the counter-revolution begun in march 1793 in the vend e by july had spread to brittany normandy bordeaux marseilles toulon lyon paris convention government between october and december 1793 with brutal measures managed to subdue most internal uprisings at the cost of tens of thousands of lives some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives 59 60 france in february 1794 abolished slavery in its american colonies but would reintroduce it later political disagreements and enmity in the national convention between october 1793 and july 1794 reached unprecedented levels leading to dozens of convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined meanwhile france s external wars in 1794 were going prosperous for example in belgium in 1795 the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of catholic religion and fair distribution of food until 1799 politicians apart from inventing a new parliamentary system the directory busied themselves with dissuading the people from catholicism and from royalism napoleon and 19th century 1799 1914 napoleon emperor of the french and his grande arm e built a vast empire across europe his conquests spread the french revolutionary ideals across much of europe such as popular sovereignty legal equality republicanism and administrative reorganization while his legal reforms had a major impact worldwide nationalism especially in germany emerged in reaction against him 61 napoleon bonaparte seized control of the republic in 1799 becoming first consul and later emperor of the french empire 1804 1814 1815 as a continuation of the wars sparked by the european monarchies against the french republic changing sets of european coalitions declared wars on napoleon s empire his armies conquered most of continental europe with swift victories such as the battles of jena-auerstadt or austerlitz members of the bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms 62 these victories led to the worldwide expansion of french revolutionary ideals and reforms such as the metric system the napoleonic code and the declaration of the rights of man after the catastrophic russian campaign and the ensuing uprising of european monarchies against his rule napoleon was defeated and the bourbon monarchy restored about a million frenchmen died during the napoleonic wars 62 after his brief return from exile napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the battle of waterloo the monarchy was re-established 1815 1830 with new constitutional limitations the discredited bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the july revolution of 1830 which established the constitutional july monarchy which lasted until 1848 when the french second republic was proclaimed in the wake of the european revolutions of 1848 the abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage both briefly enacted during the french revolution were re-enacted in 1848 in 1852 the president of the french republic louis-napol on bonaparte napoleon i s nephew was proclaimed emperor of the second empire as napoleon iii he multiplied french interventions abroad especially in crimea in mexico and italy which resulted in the annexation of the duchy of savoy and the county of nice then part of the kingdom of sardinia napoleon iii was unseated following defeat in the franco-prussian war of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the third republic animated map of the growth and decline of the french colonial empire france had colonial possessions in various forms since the beginning of the 17th century but in the 19th and 20th centuries its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the british empire including metropolitan france the total area of land under french sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s 8.6 of the world s land known as the belle poque the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism regional peace economic prosperity and technological scientific and cultural innovations in 1905 state secularism was officially established contemporary period 1914 present french poilus sustained the highest number of casualties among the allies in world war i france was a member of the triple entente when world war i broke out a small part of northern france was occupied but france and its allies emerged victorious against the central powers at a tremendous human and material cost world war i left 1.4 million french soldiers dead 4 of its population 63 between 27 and 30 of soldiers conscripted from 1912 1915 were killed 64 the interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the popular front government annual leave eight-hour workdays women in government etc charles de gaulle took an active part in many major events of the 20th century a hero of world war i leader of the free french during world war ii he then became president where he facilitated decolonisation maintained france as a major power and overcame the revolt of may 1968 in 1940 france was invaded and occupied by nazi germany metropolitan france was divided into a german occupation zone in the north and vichy france a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with germany in the south while free france the government-in-exile led by charles de gaulle was set up in london 65 from 1942 to 1944 about 160,000 french citizens including around 75,000 jews 66 67 68 were deported to death camps and concentration camps in germany and occupied poland 69 on 6 june 1944 the allies invaded normandy and in august they invaded provence over the following year the allies and the french resistance emerged victorious over the axis powers and french sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the provisional government of the french republic gprf this interim government established by de gaulle aimed to continue to wage war against germany and to purge collaborators from office it also made several important reforms suffrage extended to women creation of a social security system the gprf laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the fourth republic which saw spectacular economic growth les trente glorieuses france was one of the founding members of nato 1949 france attempted to regain control of french indochina but was defeated by the viet minh in 1954 at the climactic battle of dien bien phu only months later france faced another anti-colonialist conflict in algeria torture and illegal executions were perpetrated by both sides and the debate over whether or not to keep control of algeria then home to over one million european settlers 70 wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war 71 in 1958 the weak and unstable fourth republic gave way to the fifth republic which included a strengthened presidency 72 in the latter role charles de gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the algerian war the war was concluded with the vian accords in 1962 that led to algerian independence a vestige of the colonial empire are the french overseas departments and territories in the context of the cold war de gaulle pursued a policy of national independence towards the western and eastern blocs to this end he withdrew from nato s military integrated command he launched a nuclear development programme and made france the fourth nuclear power he restored cordial franco-german relations in order to create a european counterweight between the american and soviet spheres of influence however he opposed any development of a supranational europe favouring a europe of sovereign nations in the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968 the revolt of may 1968 had an enormous social impact in france it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal religion patriotism respect for authority shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal secularism individualism sexual revolution although the revolt was a political failure as the gaullist party emerged even stronger than before it announced a split between the french people and de gaulle who resigned shortly after republican march place de la r publique paris in the post-gaullist era france remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt in the late 20th and early 21st centuries france has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational european union notably by signing the maastricht treaty which created the european union in 1992 establishing the eurozone in 1999 and signing the lisbon treaty in 2007 73 france has also gradually but fully reintegrated into nato and has since participated in most nato sponsored wars 74 since the 19th century france has received many immigrants these have been mostly male foreign workers from european catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed 75 during the 1970s france faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants mostly from the maghreb 75 to permanently settle in france with their families and to acquire french citizenship it resulted in hundreds of thousands of muslims especially in the larger cities living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates 76 simultaneously france renounced the assimilation of immigrants where they were expected to adhere to french traditional values and cultural norms they were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate 77 since the 1995 paris m tro and rer bombings france has been sporadically targeted by islamist organisations notably the charlie hebdo attack in january 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in french history gathering 4.4 million people 78 79 the november 2015 paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths the deadliest attack on french soil since world war ii 80 81 and the deadliest in the european union since the madrid train bombings in 2004 82 and the 2016 nice attack which caused 87 deaths during bastille day celebrations geography location and borders a relief map of metropolitan france showing cities with over 100,000 inhabitants the vast majority of france s territory and population is situated in western europe and is called metropolitan france to distinguish it from the country s various overseas polities it is bordered by the north sea in the north the english channel in the northwest the atlantic ocean in the west and the mediterranean sea in the southeast it land borders consist of belgium and luxembourg in the northeast germany and switzerland in the east italy and monaco in the southeast and andorra and spain in the south and southwest with the exception of the northeast most of france s land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features to the south and southeast the pyrenees and the alps and the jura respectively and to the east the rhine river due to its shape france is often referred to as l hexagone the hexagon metropolitan france includes various coastal islands of which the largest is corsica metropolitan france is situated mostly between latitudes 41 and 51 n and longitudes 6 w and 10 e on the western edge of europe and thus lies within the northern temperate zone its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west france has several overseas regions across the world which are organised along different in south america french guiana in the atlantic ocean saint pierre and miquelon and in the antilles guadeloupe martinique saint martin and saint

of the netherlands through the french portion of saint martin metropolitan france covers 551,500 square kilometres 212,935 sq mi 83 the largest among european union members 20 france s total land area with its overseas departments and territories excluding ad lie land is 643,801 km2 248,573 sq mi 0.45 of the total land area on earth france possesses a wide variety of landscapes from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the alps in the southeast the massif central in the south central and pyrenees in the southwest due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet france possesses the second-largest exclusive economic zone eez in the world covering 11,035,000 km2 4,260,000 mi2 just behind the eez of the united states 11,351,000 km2 4,383,000 mi2 but ahead of the eez of australia 8,148,250 km2 4,111,312 mi2 its eez covers approximately 8 of the total surface of all the eezs of the world geology topography and hydrography mont blanc is the highest summit in western europe the topography provides a major source of water and hydropower thanks to the numerous dams throughout the mountain ranges mont-cenis lake metropolitan france has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes large parts of the current territory of france were raised during several tectonic episodes like the hercynian uplift in the paleozoic era during which the armorican massif the massif central the morvan massif the vosges and ardennes ranges and the island of corsica were formed these massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the aquitaine basin in the southwest and the paris basin in the north the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of beauce and brie various routes of natural passage such as the rh ne valley allow easy communications the alpine pyrenean and jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms at 4,810.45 metres 15,782 ft 84 above sea level mont blanc located in the alps on the french and italian border is the highest point in western europe although 60 of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks these risks remain moderate the coastlines offer contrasting landscapes mountain ranges along the french riviera coastal cliffs such as the c te d alb tre and wide sandy plains in the languedoc corsica lies off the mediterranean coast france has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers seine the loire the garonne the rh ne and their tributaries whose combined catchment includes over 62 of the metropolitan territory the rh ne divides the massif central from the alps and flows into the mediterranean sea at the camargue other water courses drain towards the meuse and rhine along the north-eastern borders france has 11 million square kilometres 4.2 10 6 sq mi of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction of which 97 are overseas climate most of the low-lying areas of metropolitan france are located in the oceanic climate zone cfb and cfc in the k ppen classification corsica and a small part of the territory bordering the mediterranean basin lies in the csa and csb zones as the french metropolitan territory is relatively large the climate is not uniform giving rise to the following climate nuances the west of france has strictly oceanic climate cfb it extends from flanders to the basque country in a coastal strip several tens of kilometres wide narrower to the north and south but wider in brittany which is almost entirely in this climate zone the climate of the southwest is also oceanic but warmer the climate of the northwest is oceanic but cooler and windier away from the coast the climate is oceanic throughout but its characteristics change somewhat the paris sedimentary basin and more so the basins protected by mountain chains show a stronger seasonal temperature variability and less rainfall during autumn and winter therefore most of the territory has a semi-oceanic climate and forms a transition zone between strictly oceanic climate near the coasts and other climate zones the semi-continental climate cfc of the north and centre-east alsace plains of the sa ne the middle part of the rh ne dauphin auvergne and savoy the mediterranean and the lower rh ne valley experience a mediterranean climate csa and csb due to the effect of mountain chains isolating them from the rest of the country and the resulting mistral and tramontane winds the mountain or alpine climates dfc and et are confined to the alps the pyrenees and the summits of the massif central the jura and the vosges in the overseas regions there are three broad types of climate a tropical climate am in most overseas regions including eastern french guiana high constant temperature throughout the year with a dry and a wet season an equatorial climate af in western french guiana high constant temperature with even precipitation throughout the year a subpolar climate et in saint pierre and miquelon and in most of the french southern and antarctic lands short mild summers and long very cold winters environment marine blue regional green and national red natural parks in france france was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry in 1971 85 although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world france is ranked only 17th by carbon dioxide emissions behind less populous nations such as canada or australia this is because france decided to invest in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis 86 which now accounts for 75 of its electricity production 87 and results in less pollution 88 89 like all european union members france agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20 of 1990 levels by the year 2020 90 compared to the u s plan to reduce emissions by 4 of 1990 levels 91 as of 2009 french carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of china s 92 the country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted 93 which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually 94 however the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening french businesses 95 forests account for 28 of france s land area 96 97 and are some of the most diverse in europe comprising more than 140 species of trees 98 there are nine national parks 99 and 46 natural parks in france 100

establishment in france between local authorities and the french national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty in order to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area 103 a pnr sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park s unique landscape and heritage the parks foster ecological research programmes and public education in the natural sciences 104 as of 2014 there are 49 pnrs in france 105 according

codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates among the 101 departments of france five french guiana guadeloupe martinique mayotte and r union are in overseas regions roms that are also simultaneously overseas departments doms enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the european union the 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements which are in turn subdivided into 2,054 cantons 109 these cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes which are municipalities with an elected municipal council 109 three communes paris lyon and marseille are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements the regions departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions however this was not always the case until 1940 the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly but these were suspended by the vichy regime and definitely abolished by the fourth republic in 1946 overseas territories and collectivities in addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments

republic is a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic with strong democratic traditions 112 the constitution of the fifth republic was approved by referendum on 28 september 1958 113 it greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to parliament the executive branch itself has two leaders the president of the republic currently emmanuel macron who is head of state and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term formerly 7 years 114 and the government led by the president-appointed prime minister the french parliament is a bicameral legislature comprising a national assembly assembl e nationale and a senate 115 the national assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms 116 the assembly has the power to dismiss the government and thus the majority in the assembly determines the choice of government senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms originally 9-year terms and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in september 2008 117 the senate s legislative powers are limited in the event of disagreement between the two chambers the national assembly has the final say 118 the government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of parliament until world war ii radicals were a strong political force in france embodied by the republican radical and radical-socialist party which was the most important party of the third republic since world war ii they were marginalized while french politics became characterised by two politically opposed groupings one left-wing centred on the french section of the workers international and its successor the socialist party since 1969 and the other right-wing centred on the gaullist party whose name changed over time the rally of the french people 1947 the union of democrats for the republic 1958 the rally for the republic 1976 the union for a popular movement 2007 and the republicans since 2015 in the 2017 presidential and legislative elections radical centrist party en marche became the dominant force overtaking both socialists and republicans law france uses a civil legal system 83 that is law arises primarily from written statutes judges are not to make law but merely to interpret it though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the napoleonic code which was in turn largely based on the royal law codified under louis xiv in agreement with the principles of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society as guy canivet first president of the court of cassation wrote about the management of prisons freedom is the rule and its restriction is the exception any restriction of freedom must be provided for by law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality that is law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy the basic principles that the french republic must respect are found in the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen french law is divided into two principal areas private law and public law private law includes in particular civil law and criminal law public law includes in particular administrative law and constitutional law however in practical terms french law comprises three principal areas of law civil law criminal law and administrative law criminal laws can only address the future and not the past criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited 119 while administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries it is completely separated in france and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court ordinary courts which handle criminal and civil litigation are headed by the court of cassation and administrative courts are headed by the council of state to be applicable every law must be officially published in the journal officiel de la r publique fran aise france does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions france has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws the latter being abolished in 1791 however offences against public decency contraires aux bonnes m urs or disturbing public order trouble l ordre public have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution since 1999 civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted and since may 2013 same-sex marriage and lgbt adoption are legal in france 120 laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881 some consider however that hate speech laws in france are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech 121 france has laws against racism and antisemitism 122 since 1990 the gayssot act prohibits holocaust denial freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen the 1905 french law on the separation of the churches and the state is the basis for la cit state secularism the state does not formally recognize any religion except in alsace-moselle nonetheless it does recognize religious associations the parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004 in 2010 it banned the wearing of face-covering islamic veils in public human rights groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch described the law as discriminatory towards muslims 123 124 however it is supported by most of the population 125 foreign relations french president fran ois mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl in 1987 france is a founding member of the united nations and serves as one of the

founding member since the 1960s france has developed close ties with reunified germany to become the most influential driving force of the eu 134 in the 1960s france sought to exclude the british from the european unification process 135 seeking to build its own standing in continental europe however since 1904 france has maintained an entente cordiale with the united kingdom and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries especially militarily the european parliament in strasbourg near the border with germany france is a founding member of all eu institutions france is a member of the north atlantic treaty organisation nato but under president de gaulle it excluded itself from the joint military command to protest the special relationship between the united states and britain and to preserve the independence of french foreign and security policies however as a result of nicolas sarkozy s pro-american politics much criticised in france by the leftists and by a part of the right france rejoined the nato joint military command on 4 april 2009 136 137 138 in the early 1990s the country drew considerable criticism from other nations for its underground nuclear tests

separation of the churches and the state 257 since 1905 the french government has followed the principle of la cit in which it is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in alsace-moselle it recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine conversely religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policy-making 258 certain groups such as scientology children of god the unification church or the

romanticism with th odore g ricault and eug ne delacroix and realism with camille corot gustave courbet and jean-fran ois millet a style that eventually evolved into naturalism in the second part of
