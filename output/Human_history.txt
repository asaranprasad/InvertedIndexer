history of humanity or human history as determined from archaeology anthropology genetics linguistics and other disciplines and for periods since the invention of writing from recorded history and from secondary sources and studies humanity s written history was preceded by its prehistory beginning with the palaeolithic era early stone age followed by the neolithic era new stone age the neolithic saw the agricultural revolution begin between 8000 and 5000 bce in the near east s fertile crescent the agricultural revolution marked a fundamental change in history with humans beginning the systematic husbandry of plants and animals 2 as agriculture advanced most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements the relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units fostered by advances in transportation whether in prehistoric or historic times people always had to be near reliable sources of potable water cities developed on river banks as early as 3000 bce when some of the first well-developed settlements arose in mesopotamia 3 on the banks of egypt s nile river 4 5 in the indus river valley 6 and along china s rivers 7 8 as farming developed grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities which provided the foundation for civilization the growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing with civilizations flourishing ancient history antiquity including the classical age 9 up to about 500 ce 10 saw the rise and fall of empires post-classical history the middle ages c 500 1500 ce 11 witnessed the rise of christianity the islamic golden age c 750 ce c 1258 ce and the early italian renaissance from around 1300 ce the early modern period sometimes referred to as the european age 12 from about 1500 to 1800 13 included the age of enlightenment and the age of discovery the mid-15th-century invention of modern printing employing movable type 14 revolutionized communication and facilitated ever wider dissemination of information helping end the middle ages and ushering in the scientific revolution 15 by the 18th century the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the industrial revolution 16 and began the late modern period which starts around 1800 and includes the current day 17 this scheme of historical periodization dividing history into antiquity post-classical early modern and late modern periods was developed for and applies best to the history of the old world particularly europe and the mediterranean outside this region including ancient china and ancient india historical timelines unfolded differently however by the 18th century due to extensive world trade and colonization the histories of most civilizations had become substantially intertwined in the last quarter-millennium the rates of growth of population knowledge technology communications commerce

the bonobo the closest living relative of modern humans around 4.6 to 6.2 million years ago 19 anatomically modern humans arose in africa about 200,000 years ago 20 and reached behavioural modernity about 50,000 years ago 21 cave painting lascaux france c 15,000 bce venus of willensdorf austria c 26,500 bce modern humans spread rapidly from africa into the frost-free zones of europe and asia around 60,000 years ago 22 the rapid expansion of humankind to north america and oceania took place at the climax of the most recent ice age when temperate regions of today were extremely inhospitable yet humans had colonized nearly all the ice-free parts of the globe by the end of the ice age some 12,000 years ago 23 other hominids such as homo erectus had been using simple wood and stone tools for millennia but as time progressed tools became far more refined and complex perhaps as early as 1.8 million years ago but certainly by 500,000 years ago humans began using fire for heat and cooking 24 they also developed language in the paleolithic period 25 and a conceptual repertoire that included systematic burial of the dead and adornment of the living early artistic expression can be found in the form of cave paintings and sculptures made from ivory stone and bone showing a spirituality generally interpreted as animism or even shamanism 26 during this period all humans lived as hunter-gatherers and were generally nomadic 27 archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of paleolithic hunter-gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover 28 rise of civilization the neolithic revolution beginning around 10,000 bce saw the development of agriculture which fundamentally changed the human lifestyle farming developed around 10,000 bce in the middle east around 7000 bce in what is now china about 6000 bce in the indus valley and europe and about 4000 bce in the americas 29 cultivation of cereal crops and the domestication of animals occurred around 8500 bce in the middle east where wheat and barley were the first crops and sheep and goats were domesticated 30 in the indus valley crops were cultivated by 6000 bce along with domesticated cattle the yellow river valley in china cultivated millet and other cereal crops by about 7000 bce but the yangtze river valley domesticated rice earlier by at least 8000 bce in the americas sunflowers were cultivated by about 4000 bce and corn and beans were domesticated in central america by 3500 bce potatoes were first cultivated in the andes mountains of south america where the llama was also domesticated 29 metal-working starting with copper around 6000 bce was first used for tools and ornaments gold soon followed with its main use being for ornaments the need for metal ores stimulated trade as many of the areas of early human settlement were lacking in ores bronze an alloy of copper and tin is first known from about 2500 bce but did not become widely used until much later 31 cuneiform writing mesopotamia though early cities appeared at jericho and catal huyuk around 6000 bce 32 the first civilizations did not emerge until around 3000 bce in egypt 33 and mesopotamia 34 these cultures gave birth to the invention of the wheel 35 mathematics 36 bronze-working sailing boats the pottery wheel woven cloth construction of monumental buildings 37 and writing 38 writing developed independently and at different times in five areas of the world 39 egypt c 3200 bce 39 india c 3200 bce 40 mesopotamia c 3000 bce 41 china c 1600 bce 42 and mesoamerica c 600 bce 39 farming permitted far denser populations which in time organized into states agriculture also created food surpluses that could support people not directly engaged in food production 43 the development of agriculture permitted the creation of the first cities these were centres of trade manufacturing and political power 44 cities established a symbiosis with their surrounding countrysides absorbing agricultural products and providing in return manufactured goods and varying degrees of military control and protection the development of cities was synonymous with the rise of civilization a early civilizations arose first in lower mesopotamia 3000 bce 46 47 followed by egyptian civilization along the nile river 3000 bce 5 the harappan civilization in the indus river valley in present-day india and pakistan 2500 bce 48 49 and chinese civilization along the yellow and yangtze rivers 2200 bce 7 8 these societies developed a number of unifying characteristics including a central government a complex economy and social structure sophisticated language and writing systems and distinct cultures and religions writing facilitated the administration of cities the expression of ideas and the preservation of information 50 entities such as the sun moon earth sky and sea were often deified citation needed shrines developed which evolved into temple establishments complete with a complex hierarchy of priests and priestesses and other functionaries typical of the neolithic was a

the tigris and euphrates in mesopotamia the nile in egypt citation needed the indus in the indian subcontinent 48 and the yangtze and yellow rivers in china sumer located in mesopotamia is the first known complex civilization developing the first city-states in the 4th millennium bce 47 it was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing cuneiform script appeared around 3000 bce 39 51 cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs these pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract 51 cuneiform texts were written on clay tablets on which symbols were drawn with a blunt reed used as a stylus 39 writing made the administration of a large state far easier transport was facilitated by waterways by rivers and seas the mediterranean sea at the juncture of three continents fostered the projection of military power and the exchange of goods ideas and inventions this era also saw new land technologies such as horse-based cavalry and chariots that allowed armies to move faster fresco knossos minoan crete these developments led to the rise of territorial states and empires in mesopotamia there prevailed a pattern of independent warring city-states and of a loose hegemony shifting from one city to another citation needed in egypt by contrast first there was a dual division into upper and lower egypt which was shortly followed by unification of all the valley around 3100 bce followed by permanent pacification 52 in crete the minoan civilization had entered the bronze age by 2700 bce and is regarded as the first civilization in

society and ended in the 6th century bce 56 from around 550 bce many independent kingdoms and republics known as the mahajanapadas were established across the subcontinent 57 as complex civilizations arose in the eastern hemisphere the indigenous societies in the americas remained relatively simple and fragmented into diverse regional cultures during the formative stage in mesoamerica about 1500 bce to 500 ce more complex and centralized civilizations began to develop mostly in what is now mexico central america and peru they included civilizations such as the olmec maya zapotec moche and nazca they developed agriculture growing maize chili peppers cocoa tomatoes and potatoes crops unique to the americas and creating distinct cultures and religions these ancient indigenous societies would be greatly affected for good and ill by european contact during the early modern period axial age buddha socrates beginning in the 8th century bce the axial age saw the development of a set of

some scholars to have developed in the 6th century bce karl jaspers axial-age theory also includes persian zoroastrianism but other scholars dispute his timeline for zoroastrianism in the 5th century bce socrates and plato made substantial advances in the development of ancient greek philosophy in the east three schools of thought would dominate chinese thinking until the modern day these were taoism legalism and confucianism the confucian tradition which would become particularly dominant looked for political morality not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition confucianism would later spread to the korean peninsula and toward japan in the west the greek philosophical tradition represented by socrates plato aristotle and other philosophers 58 along with accumulated science technology and culture diffused throughout europe egypt the middle east and northwest india starting in the 4th century bce after the conquests of alexander iii of macedon alexander the great 59 regional empires the millennium from 500 bce to 500 ce saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop well-trained professional armies unifying ideologies and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects the great empires depended on military annexation of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres the relative peace that the empires brought encouraged international trade most notably the massive trade routes in the mediterranean the maritime trade web in the indian ocean and the silk road in southern europe the greeks and later the romans in an era known as classical antiquity established

many others 69 maya observatory chichen itza mexico in africa the kingdom of aksum centred in present-day ethiopia established itself by the 1st century ce as a major trading empire dominating its neighbours in south arabia and kush and controlling the red sea trade it minted its own currency and carved enormous monolithic steles such as the obelisk of axum to mark their emperors graves successful regional empires were also established in the americas arising from cultures established as early as 2500 bce 70 in mesoamerica vast pre-columbian societies were built the most notable being the zapotec empire 700 bce 1521 ce 71 and the maya civilization which reached its highest state of development during the mesoamerican classic period c 250 900 ce 72 but continued throughout the post-classic period until the arrival of the spanish in the 16th century ce maya civilization arose as the olmec mother culture gradually declined the great mayan city-states slowly rose in number and prominence and maya culture spread throughout the yucat n and surrounding areas the later empire of the aztecs was built on neighbouring cultures and was influenced by conquered peoples such as the toltecs some areas experienced slow but steady technological advances with important developments such as the stirrup and moldboard plough arriving every few centuries there were however in some regions periods of rapid technological progress most important perhaps was the mediterranean area during the hellenistic period when hundreds of technologies were invented 73 such periods were followed by periods of technological decay as during the roman empire s decline and fall and the ensuing early medieval period declines falls and resurgence the empires faced common problems associated with maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy these costs fell most heavily on the peasantry while land-owning magnates increasingly evaded centralized control and its costs barbarian pressure on the frontiers hastened internal dissolution china s han dynasty fell into civil war in 220 ce beginning the three kingdoms period while its roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the crisis of the third century the great empires of eurasia were all located on temperate and subtropical coastal plains from the central asian steppes horse-based nomads mainly mongols and turks dominated a large part of the continent the development of the stirrup and the breeding of horses strong enough to carry a fully armed archer made the nomads a constant threat to the more settled civilizations pantheon rome now a catholic church the gradual break-up of the roman empire spanning several centuries after the 2nd century ce coincided with the spread of christianity outward from the middle east 74 the western roman empire fell under the domination of germanic tribes in the 5th century 75 and these polities gradually developed into a number of warring states all associated in one way or another with the catholic church 76 the remaining part of the roman empire in the eastern mediterranean continued as what came to be called the byzantine empire 77 centuries later a limited unity would be restored to western europe through the establishment in 962 of a revived roman empire 78 later called the holy roman empire 79 comprising a number of states in what is now germany austria switzerland czech republic belgium italy and parts of france 80 81 in china dynasties would rise and fall but by sharp contrast to the mediterranean-european world dynastic unity would be restored after the fall of the eastern han dynasty 82 and the demise of the three kingdoms nomadic tribes from the north began to invade in the 4th century eventually conquering areas of northern china and setting up many small kingdoms citation needed the sui dynasty successfully reunified the whole of china 83 in 581 84 and laid the foundations for a chinese golden age under the tang dynasty 618 907 post-classical history university of timbuktu mali the post-classical era though deriving its name from the eurocentric era of classical antiquity refers to a broader geographic sweep the era is commonly dated from the 5th-century fall of the western roman empire which fragmented into many separate kingdoms some of which would later be confederated under the holy roman empire the eastern roman or byzantine empire survived until late in the post-classical or medieval period the post-classical period also encompasses the early muslim conquests the subsequent islamic golden age and the commencement and expansion of the arab slave trade followed by the mongol invasions in the middle east and central asia citation needed and the founding around 1280 of the ottoman empire 85 south asia saw a series of middle kingdoms of india followed by the establishment of islamic empires in india in western africa the mali empire and the songhai empire developed on the southeast coast of africa arabic ports were established where gold spices and other commodities were traded this allowed africa to join the southeast asia trading system bringing it contact with asia this along with muslim culture resulted in the swahili culture the chinese empire experienced the successive sui tang song yuan early ming dynasties middle eastern trade routes along the indian ocean and the silk road through the gobi desert provided limited economic and cultural contact between asian and european civilizations during the same period civilizations in the americas such as the inca maya and aztec reached their height all would be seriously compromised by contact with european colonists at the beginning of the modern period middle east central asia and north africa prior to the advent of islam in the 7th century the middle east was dominated by the byzantine empire and the persian sasanian empire which constantly fought each other for control of several disputed regions this was also a cultural battle with the byzantine hellenistic and christian culture competing against the persian iranian traditions and zoroastrian religion the formation of the islamic religion created a new contender that quickly surpassed both of these empires islam greatly affected the political economic and military history of the old world especially the middle east great mosque of kairouan tunisia founded 670 ce from their centre on the arabian peninsula muslims began their expansion during the early postclassical era by 750 ce they came to conquer most of the near east north africa and parts of europe ushering in an era of learning science and invention known as the islamic golden age the knowledge and skills of the ancient near east greece and persia were preserved in the postclassical era by muslims who also added new and important innovations from outside such as the manufacture of paper from china and decimal positional numbering from india much of this learning and development can be linked to geography even prior to islam s presence the city of mecca had served as a centre of trade in arabia and the islamic prophet muhammad himself was a merchant with the new islamic tradition of the hajj the pilgrimage to mecca the city became even more a centre for exchanging goods and ideas the influence held by muslim merchants over african-arabian and arabian-asian trade routes was tremendous as a result islamic civilization grew and expanded on the basis of its merchant economy in contrast to the europeans indians and chinese who based their societies on an agricultural landholding nobility merchants brought goods and their islamic faith to china india southeast asia and the kingdoms of western africa and returned with new discoveries and inventions crusader krak des chevaliers syria motivated by religion and dreams of conquest european kings launched a number of crusades to try to roll back muslim power and retake the holy land the crusades were ultimately unsuccessful and served more to weaken the byzantine empire especially with the 1204 sack of constantinople which began to lose increasing amounts of territory to the ottoman turks arab domination of the region ended in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the seljuq turks migrating south from the turkic homelands in central asia in

the tang empire competed with the tibetan empire for control of areas in inner and central asia 89 in the 8th century islam began to penetrate the region and soon became the sole faith of most of the population though buddhism remained strong in the east citation needed the desert nomads of arabia could militarily match the nomads of the steppe and the early arab empire gained control over parts of central asia the hephthalites were the most powerful of the nomad groups in the 6th and 7th centuries and controlled much of the region in the 9th through 13th centuries the region was divided among several powerful states including the samanid dynasty citation needed the seljuq dynasty 90 and the khwarezmid empire the most spectacular power to rise out of central asia developed when genghis khan united the tribes of mongolia the mongol empire spread to comprise all of central asia and china as well as large parts of russia and the middle east citation needed after genghis khan died in 1227 91 most of central asia continued to be dominated by the successor chagatai khanate in 1369 timur a turkic leader in the mongol military tradition conquered most of the region and founded the timurid empire timur s large empire collapsed soon after his death however the region then became divided into a series of smaller khanates that were created by the uzbeks these included the khanate of khiva the khanate of bukhara and the khanate of kokand all of whose capitals are located in present-day uzbekistan north africa saw the rise of polities formed by the berbers such as the marinid dynasty in morocco the zayyanid dynasty in algeria and the hafsid dynasty in tunisia the region will later be called the barbary coast and will host pirates and privateers who will use several north african ports for their raids against the coastal towns of several european countries in search of slaves to be sold in north african markets as part of the barbary slave trade europe europe during the early middle ages was characterized by depopulation deurbanization and barbarian invasion all of which had begun in late antiquity the barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the western roman empire in the 7th century north africa and the middle east once part of the eastern roman empire became part of the caliphate after conquest by muhammad s successors although there were substantial changes in society and political structures the break was not as extreme as once put forth by historians with most of the new kingdoms incorporating as many of the existing roman institutions as they could christianity expanded in western europe and monasteries were founded in the 7th and 8th centuries the franks under the carolingian dynasty established an empire covering much of western europe citation needed it lasted until the 9th century when it succumbed to pressure from new invaders the vikings 92 magyars and saracens notre dame cathedral paris france during the high middle ages which began after 1000 the population of europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase manorialism the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labour service to nobles and feudalism a political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rents from lands and manors were two of the ways of organizing medieval society that developed during the high middle ages kingdoms became more centralized after the decentralizing effects of the breakup of the carolingian empire the crusades first preached in 1095 were an attempt by western christians from countries such as the kingdom of england the kingdom of france and the holy roman empire to regain control of the holy land from the muslims and succeeded long enough to establish some christian states in the near east also merchants imported thousands of armenians circassians georgians greeks and slavs into italy to work as household slaves and in processing sugar intellectual life was marked by scholasticism and the founding of universities while the building of gothic cathedrals was one of the outstanding artistic achievements of the age the late middle ages were marked by difficulties and calamities famine plague and war devastated the population of western europe citation needed the black death alone killed approximately 75 to 200 million people between 1347 and 1350 93 94 it was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history starting in asia the disease reached mediterranean and western europe during the late 1340s 95 and killed tens of millions of europeans in six years between a third and a half of the population perished the middle ages witnessed the first sustained urbanization of northern and western europe many modern european states owe their origins to events unfolding in the middle ages present european political boundaries are in many regards the result of military and dynastic events during this tumultuous period citation needed the middle ages lasted until the beginning of the early modern period in the 16th century 13 marked by the rise of nation states 96 the division of western christianity in the reformation 97 the rise of humanism in the italian renaissance 98 and the beginnings of european overseas expansion which allowed for the columbian exchange sub-saharan africa brass benin bronze nigeria medieval sub-saharan africa was home to many different civilizations the kingdom of aksum declined in the 7th century as islam cut it off from its christian allies and its people moved further into the ethiopian highlands for protection they eventually gave way to the zagwe dynasty who are famed for their rock cut architecture at lalibela the zagwe would then fall to the solomonic dynasty who claimed descent from the aksumite emperors citation needed and would rule the country well into the 20th century in the west african sahel region many islamic empires rose such as the ghana empire the mali empire the songhai empire and the kanem empire they controlled the

without mortar such as great zimbabwe capital of the kingdom of zimbabwe khami capital of kingdom of butua and danangombe dhlo-dhlo capital of the rozwi empire the swahili people themselves were the inhabitants of the east african coast from kenya to mozambique who traded extensively with asians and arabs who introduced them to islam they built many port cities such as mombasa zanzibar and kilwa

military advance was largely halted at that point but islam still spread in india largely due to the influence of arab merchants along the western coast the tripartite struggle for control of northern india took place in the ninth century the struggle was between the pratihara empire the pala empire and the rashtrakuta empire some of the important states that emerged in india at this time included the bahmani sultanate and the vijayanagara empire post-classical dynasties in south india included those of the chalukyas the rashtrakutas the hoysalas the cholas the islamic mughals the marathas and

needed during this period the imperial government undertook great public works including government offices temples roads and irrigation systems citation needed the heian period 794 to 1185 saw the peak of imperial power followed by the rise of militarized clans and the beginning of japanese feudalism the feudal period of japanese history dominated by powerful regional lords daimy s and the military rule of warlords sh guns such as the ashikaga shogunate and tokugawa shogunate stretched from 1185 to 1868 the emperor remained but mostly as a figurehead and the power of merchants was weak postclassical korea saw the end of the three kingdoms era the three kingdoms being goguryeo baekje and silla silla conquered baekje in 660 and goguryeo in 668 105 marking the beginning of the north south states period with unified silla in the south and balhae a successor state to goguryeo in the north 106 in 892 ce this arrangement reverted to the later three kingdoms with goguryeo then called

eastern polynesian colonists from places as far away as hawai i new zealand aotearoa and the tuamotu islands for political spiritual and economic reasons until the unexplained collapse of regular long-distance voyaging in the eastern pacific a few centuries before europeans began exploring the area indigenous written records from this period are virtually non-existent as it seems that all pacific islanders with the possible exception of the enigmatic rapa nui and their currently undecipherable rongorongo script had no writing systems of any kind until after their introduction by european colonists however some indigenous prehistories can be estimated and academically reconstructed through careful judicious analysis of native oral traditions colonial ethnography archaeology

history the modern period the modern era modern times is history of the period following the middle ages contemporary history is history that only covers events from around 1945 to the present day early modern period early modern period b is a term used by historians to refer to the period between the middle ages post-classical history and the industrial revolution roughly 1500 to 1800 13 the early modern period is characterized by the rise of science and by increasingly rapid technological progress secularized civic politics and the nation state capitalist economies began their rise initially in northern italian republics such as genoa the early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the mercantilist economic theory as such the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance in much of the european sphere of feudalism serfdom and the power of the catholic church the period includes the protestant reformation the disastrous thirty years war the age of discovery european colonial expansion the peak of european witch-hunting the scientific revolution and the age of enlightenment c renaissance da vinci s vitruvian man renaissance italy europe s renaissance beginning in the 14th century and extending into the 16th consisted of the rediscovery of the classical world s scientific contributions and of the economic and social rise of europe the renaissance also engendered a culture of inquisitiveness which ultimately led to humanism 111 and the scientific revolution 112 although it saw social and political upheaval and revolutions in many intellectual pursuits the renaissance is perhaps known best for its artistic developments citation needed and the contributions of such polymaths as leonardo da vinci and michelangelo who inspired the term renaissance man european expansion 1570 world map with europeans discoveries during this period european powers came to dominate most of the world although the most developed regions of european classical civilization were more urbanized than any other region of the world european civilization had undergone a lengthy period of gradual decline and collapse during the early modern period europe was able to regain its dominance historians still debate the causes europe s success in this period stands in contrast to other regions for example one of the most advanced civilizations of the middle ages was china it had developed an advanced monetary economy by 1,000 ce china had a free peasantry who were no longer subsistence farmers and could sell their produce and actively participate in the market according to adam smith writing in the 18th century china had long been one of the richest most fertile best cultivated most industrious most urbanized and most prosperous countries in the world it enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in cast iron production piston bellows suspension bridge construction printing and the compass however it seemed to have long since stopped progressing marco polo who visited china in the 13th century describes its cultivation industry and populousness almost in the same terms as travelers would in the 18th century gutenberg bible produced using movable type c 1450 one theory of europe s rise holds that europe s geography played an important role in its success the middle east india and china are all ringed by mountains and oceans but once past these outer barriers are nearly flat by contrast the pyrenees alps apennines carpathians and other mountain ranges run through europe and the continent is also divided by several seas this gave europe some degree of protection from the peril of central asian invaders before the era of firearms these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the eurasian continent and as they broke out into the plains of northern india or the valleys of china were all but unstoppable these invasions were often devastating the golden age of islam was ended by the mongol sack of baghdad in 1258 india and china were subject to periodic invasions and russia spent a couple of centuries under the mongol-tatar yoke central and western europe logistically more distant from the central asian heartland proved less vulnerable to these threats geography contributed to important geopolitical differences for most of their histories china india and the middle east were each unified under a single dominant power that expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts citation needed in 1600 the ottoman empire controlled almost all the middle east 113 the ming dynasty ruled china 114 115 and the mughal empire held sway over india by contrast europe was almost always divided into a number of warring states pan-european empires with the notable exception of the roman empire tended to collapse soon after they arose another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of europe was the mediterranean sea which for millennia had functioned as a maritime superhighway fostering the exchange of goods people ideas and inventions nearly all the agricultural civilizations have been heavily constrained by their environments productivity remained low and climatic changes easily instigated boom-and-bust cycles that brought about civilizations rise and fall by about 1500 however there was a qualitative change in world history technological advance and the wealth generated by trade gradually brought about a widening of possibilities 116 many have also argued that europe s institutions allowed it to expand that property rights and free-market economics were stronger than elsewhere due to an ideal of freedom peculiar to europe in recent years however scholars such as kenneth pomeranz have challenged this view europe s maritime expansion unsurprisingly given the continent s geography was largely the work of its atlantic states portugal spain england france and the netherlands initially the portuguese and spanish empires were the predominant conquerors and sources of influence and their union resulted in the iberian union the first global empire on which the sun never set soon the more northern english french and dutch began to dominate the atlantic in a series of wars fought in the 17th and 18th centuries culminating with the napoleonic wars britain emerged as the new world power regional developments hagia sophia istanbul formerly constantinople turkey persia came under the rule of the safavid empire in 1501 succeeded by the afsharid empire in 1736 and the qajar empire in 1796 areas to the north and east were held by uzbeks and pashtuns the ottoman empire after taking constantinople in 1453 quickly gained control of the middle east the balkans and most of north africa in africa this period saw a decline in many civilizations and an advancement in others the swahili coast declined after coming under portuguese and later omani control in west africa the songhai empire fell to the moroccans in 1591 when they invaded with guns the south african kingdom of zimbabwe gave way to smaller kingdoms such as mutapa butua and rozwi ethiopia suffered from the 1531 invasion from neighbouring muslim adal sultanate and in 1769 entered the zemene mesafint age of princes during which the emperor became a figurehead and the country was ruled by warlords though the royal line later would recover under emperor tewodros ii the ajuran empire in the horn of africa began to decline in the 17th century succeeded by the geledi sultanate other civilizations in africa advanced during this period the oyo empire experienced its golden age as did the benin empire the ashanti empire rose to power in what is modern day ghana in 1670 the kingdom of kongo also thrived during this period european exploration of africa reached its zenith at this time ming dynasty section great wall of china in the far east the chinese ming dynasty gave way 1644 to the qing the last chinese imperial dynasty which would rule until 1912 japan experienced its azuchi momoyama period 1568 1603 followed by the edo period 1603 1868 the korean joseon dynasty 1392 1910 ruled throughout this period successfully repelling 16th- and 17th-century invasions from japan and china japan and china were significantly affected during this period by expanded maritime trade with europe particularly the portuguese in japan during the edo period japan would pursue isolationist policies to eliminate foreign influences taj mahal mughal empire india on the indian subcontinent the delhi sultanate and the deccan sultanates would give way beginning in the 16th century to the mughal empire citation needed starting in the northwest the mughal empire would by the late 17th century come to rule the entire subcontinent 117 except for the southernmost indian provinces which would remain independent against the muslim mughal empire the hindu maratha empire was founded on the west coast in 1674 gradually gaining territory a majority of present-day india from the mughals over several decades particularly in the mughal maratha wars 1681 1701 the maratha empire would in 1818 fall under the control of the british east india company with all former maratha and mughal authority devolving in 1858 to the british raj in 1511 the portuguese overthrew the malacca sultanate in present-day malaysia and indonesian sumatra the portuguese held this important trading territory and the valuable associated navigational strait until overthrown by the dutch in 1641 the johor sultanate centred on the southern tip of the malay peninsula became the dominant trading power in the region european colonization expanded with the dutch in the netherlands east indies and the spanish in the philippines into the 19th century european expansion would affect the whole of southeast asia with the british in myanmar and malaysia and the establishment of french indochina only thailand would successfully resist colonization the pacific islands of oceania would also be affected by european contact starting with the circumnavigational voyage of ferdinand magellan who landed on the marianas and other islands in 1521 also notable were the voyages 1642 44 of abel tasman to present-day australia new zealand and nearby islands and the voyages 1768 1779 of captain james cook who made the first recorded european contact with hawaii britain would found its first colony on australia in 1788 russian chapel fort ross california us in the americas the western european powers vigorously colonized the newly discovered continents largely displacing the indigenous populations and destroying the advanced civilizations of the aztecs and the inca spain portugal britain and france all made extensive territorial claims and undertook large-scale settlement including the importation of large numbers of african slaves portugal claimed brazil spain claimed the rest of south america mesoamerica and southern north america britain colonized the east coast of north america and france colonized the central region of north america russia made incursions onto the northwest coast of north america with a first colony in present-day alaska in 1784 and the outpost of fort ross in present-day california in 1812 118 in 1762 in the midst of the seven years war france secretly ceded most of its north american claims to spain in the treaty of fontainebleau thirteen of the british colonies declared independence as the united states of america in 1776 ratified by the treaty of paris in 1783 ending the american revolutionary war napoleon bonaparte won france s claims back from spain in the napoleonic wars in 1800 but sold them to the united states in 1803 as the louisiana purchase in russia ivan the terrible was crowned 1547 the first tsar of russia and by annexing the turkic khanates in the east transformed russia into a regional power the countries of western europe while expanding prodigiously through technological advancement and colonial conquest competed with each other economically and militarily in a state of almost constant war often the wars had a religious dimension either catholic versus protestant or primarily in eastern europe christian versus muslim wars of particular note include the thirty years war the war of the spanish succession the seven years war and the french revolutionary wars napoleon came to power in france in 1799 an event foreshadowing the napoleonic wars of the early 19th century late modern period 1750 1914 watt s steam engine powered the industrial revolution the scientific revolution changed humanity s understanding of the world and led to the industrial revolution a major transformation of the world s economies the scientific revolution in the 17th century had had little immediate effect on industrial technology only in the second half of the 18th century did scientific advances begin to be applied substantially to practical invention the industrial revolution began in great britain and used new modes of production the factory mass production and mechanization to manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less labour than previously required the age of enlightenment also led to the beginnings of modern democracy in the late-18th century american and french revolutions democracy and republicanism would grow to have a profound effect on world events and on quality of life empires 1898 after europeans had achieved influence and control over the americas imperial activities turned to the lands of asia and oceania in the 19th century the european states had social and technological advantage over eastern lands citation needed britain gained control of the indian subcontinent egypt and the malay peninsula the french took indochina while the dutch cemented their control over the dutch east indies the british also colonized australia new zealand and south africa with large numbers of british colonists emigrating to these colonies russia colonized large pre-agricultural areas of siberia in the late 19th century the european powers divided the remaining areas of africa within europe economic and military challenges created a system of nation states and ethno-linguistic groupings began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for cultural and political autonomy this nationalism would become important to peoples across the world in the 20th century during the second industrial revolution the world economy became reliant on coal as a fuel as new methods of transport such as railways and steamships effectively shrank the world meanwhile industrial pollution and environmental damage present since the discovery of fire and the beginning of civilization accelerated drastically the advantages that europe had developed by the mid-18th century were two an entrepreneurial culture 119 and the wealth generated by the atlantic trade including the african slave trade by the late 16th century silver from the americas accounted for the spanish empire s wealth citation needed the profits of the slave trade and of west indian plantations amounted to 5 of the british economy at the time of the industrial revolution 120 while some historians conclude that in 1750 labour productivity in the most developed regions of china was still on a par with that of europe s atlantic economy 121 other historians like angus maddison hold that the per-capita productivity of western europe had by the late middle ages surpassed that of all other regions 122 1914 1945 world war i trench warfare atomic bombings hiroshima nagasaki 1945 the 20th century opened with europe at an apex of wealth and power and with much of the world under its direct colonial control or its indirect domination much of the rest of the world was influenced by heavily europeanized nations the united states and japan as the century unfolded however the global system dominated by rival powers was subjected to severe strains and ultimately seemed to yield to a more fluid structure of independent nations organized on western models this transformation was catalysed by wars of unparalleled scope and devastation world war i destroyed many of europe s empires and monarchies and weakened britain and france in its aftermath powerful ideologies arose the russian revolution of 1917 created the first communist state while the 1920s and 1930s saw militaristic fascist dictatorships gain control in italy germany spain and elsewhere ongoing national rivalries exacerbated by the economic turmoil of the great depression helped precipitate world war ii the militaristic dictatorships of europe and japan pursued an ultimately doomed course of imperialist expansionism their defeat opened the way for the advance of communism into central europe yugoslavia bulgaria romania albania china north vietnam and north korea contemporary history 1945 2000

nations had been formed following world war i 124 the war had left two countries the united states and the soviet union with principal power to influence international affairs 125 each was suspicious of the other and feared a global spread of the other s respectively capitalist and communist political-economic model this led to the cold war a forty-five-year stand-off and arms race between the united states and its allies on one hand and the soviet union and its allies on the other with the development of nuclear weapons during world war ii and with their subsequent proliferation all of humanity were put at risk of nuclear war between the two superpowers as demonstrated by many incidents most prominently the october 1962 cuban missile crisis such war being viewed as impractical proxy wars were instead waged at the expense of non-nuclear-armed third world countries the cold war ended in 1991 when the soviet union disintegrated in part due to inability to compete economically with the united states and western europe however the united states likewise began to show signs of slippage in her geopolitical influence 126 even as her private sector now less inhibited by the claims of the public sector increasingly sought private advantage to the prejudice of the public weal citation needed in the early postwar decades the african and asian colonies of the belgian british dutch french and other west european empires won their formal independence 127 but the newly independent countries faced challenges in the form of neocolonialism sociopolitical disarray poverty illiteracy and endemic tropical diseases 128 most western european and central european countries gradually formed a political and economic community the european union which expanded eastward to include former soviet-satellite countries 129 130 131 the european union s effectiveness was handicapped by the immaturity of its common economic and political institutions somewhat comparable to the inadequacy of united states institutions under the articles of confederation prior to the adoption of the u s constitution that came into force in 1789 asian and african countries followed suit and began taking tentative steps toward forming their own respective continental associations last moon landing apollo 17 1972 cold war preparations to deter or to fight a third world war accelerated advances in technologies that though conceptualized before world war ii had been implemented for that war s exigencies such as jet aircraft rocketry and electronic computers in the decades after world war ii these advances led to jet travel artificial satellites with innumerable applications including global positioning systems gps and the internet inventions that have revolutionized the movement of people ideas and information however not all scientific and technological advances in the second half of the 20th century required an initial military impetus that period also saw ground-breaking developments such as the discovery of the structure of dna 132 the consequent sequencing of the human genome the worldwide eradication of smallpox the discovery of plate tectonics manned and unmanned exploration of space and of previously inaccessible parts of mankind s home planet and foundational discoveries in physics phenomena ranging from the smallest entities particle physics to the greatest entity physical cosmology the century saw several global threats emerge or become more serious or more widely recognized including nuclear proliferation global climate change 133 134 135 deforestation ocean acidification overpopulation deadly epidemics of microbial diseases near-earth asteroids and comets 136 supervolcano eruptions lethal gamma-ray bursts geomagnetic storms destroying all electronic equipment and the dwindling of global natural resources particularly fossil fuels 137 21st century ballistic missile a man-made hazard to world survival that dominated concerns in the second half of the 20th century continues into the 21st countries ambitious to develop and deploy nuclear weapons are discouraged from doing so by countries that already possess them at the same time nuclear-armed countries have shown little urgency about honoring their 20th-century pledge to eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons such weapons continue to be equally hazardous to their owners as to their potential targets 138 139 partial map of internet 2005 the 21st century has been marked by growing economic globalization and integration with consequent increased risk to interlinked economies and by the expansion of communications with mobile phones and the internet which have caused fundamental societal changes in business politics and individuals personal lives the early 21st century saw escalating intra- and international strife in the near east and afghanistan stimulated by vast economic disparities by dissatisfaction with governments dominated by western interests by inter-ethnic and inter-sectarian feuds and by the longest war in the history of the united states the proximate cause for which was osama bin laden s provocative 2001 destruction of new york city s world trade center us military involvements in the near east and afghanistan drained us economic resources at a time when the us and other western countries were experiencing mounting socioeconomic dislocations aggravated by the robotization of work and the exportation of industries to cheaper-workforce countries 140 andasol solar power station in spain exploits energy constantly sent to earth

demand and competition for resources has risen due to growing populations and industrialization especially in india china and brazil see list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita this increased demand is causing increased levels of environmental degradation and a fast-growing threat of disastrous global warming that and a need for reliable energy supplies independent of politically volatile regions has spurred the development of alternative renewable sources of energy notably solar energy and wind energy proposals for cleaner fossil-fuel technologies 142 and for expanded use of nuclear energy somewhat dampened by nuclear-plant accidents 143 144 and conversely calls to eschew the indiscriminate large-scale employment of the fissile-fossil complex of fissile- nuclear and

earth d in december 2015 195 countries signed the paris climate agreement scheduled to go into effect in 2020 thus with the exception of two non-signatory countries and in june 2017 after the fact with the exception of the united states government all the world s countries explicitly recognized that this common existential threat required a common cooperative response the transition to

in many cases of periodization differs as well within a discipline such as art philosophy or history the age of enlightenment has also been referred to as the age of reason historians also include the late 17th century which is typically known as the age of reason or age of rationalism as part of the enlightenment however contemporary historians have considered the age of reason distinct to the ideas developed in the enlightenment the use of the term here includes both ages under a single all-inclusive time-frame the greenhouse effect substantially responsible for earth s global warming was first described in 1824 by the french mathematician joseph fourier the greenhouse effect is a natural mechanism that becomes dangerous if the atmosphere s greenhouse-gas concentrations exceed environmentally safe levels as they have gradually been doing since the start of the industrial revolution as predicted this is already increasing the frequency and severity of floods and droughts due to accelerated melting of icecaps glaciers and snowpacks flooding of low-lying coasts storms agricultural disruption and famines ecological displacements ocean acidification with havoc to marine life release from thawing arctic permafrost of methane a greenhouse gas more powerful than carbon dioxide and intra- and intersocietal conflicts with increased crime and warfare the multifarious irreversible damage from global warming will accelerate as environmental tipping points are reached physicist cosmologist stephen hawking on 2 july 2017 belatedly celebrating his 75th birthday warned that planet earth is rapidly approaching an irreversible tipping point that will leave the planet with an uninhabitable environment like that of venus with a temperature of 250 degrees and
