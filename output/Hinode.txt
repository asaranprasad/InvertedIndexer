telescope sot x-ray telescope xrt extreme-ultraviolet imaging spectrometer eis hinode hi no de japanese ipa inode sunrise formerly solar-b is a japan aerospace exploration agency solar mission with united states and united kingdom collaboration it is the follow-up to the yohkoh solar-a mission and it was launched on the final flight of the m-v-7 rocket from uchinoura space center japan on 22 september 2006 at 21 36 utc 23 september 06 36 jst initial orbit was perigee height 280 km apogee height 686 km inclination 98.3 degrees then the satellite maneuvered to the quasi-circular sun-synchronous orbit over the day night terminator which allows near-continuous observation of the sun on 28 october 2006 the probe s instruments captured their first images the data from hinode are being downloaded to the norwegian terrestrial svalsat station operated by kongsberg a few kilometres west of longyearbyen svalbard from there data was transmitted by telenor through a fibre-optic network to mainland norway at harstad and on to data users in north america europe and japan contents 1 mission 2 instruments 3 see also 4 references 5 external links mission edit hinode was planned as a three-year mission to explore the magnetic fields of the sun it consists of a coordinated set of optical extreme ultraviolet euv and x-ray instruments to investigate the interaction between the sun s magnetic field and its corona the result will be an improved understanding of the mechanisms that power the solar atmosphere and drive solar eruptions the euv imaging spectrometer eis was built by a consortium led by the mullard space science laboratory mssl in the uk 2 nasa the space agency of the united states was involved with three science instrument components the focal plane package fpp the x-ray telescope xrt and the extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer eis and shares operations support for science planning and instrument command generation 3 instruments edit hinode view of the 2012 venus transit hinode carries three main instruments to study the sun sot solar optical telescope a 0.5 meter gregorian optical telescope with an angular resolution of about 0.2 arcsecond over the field of view of about 400 x 400 arcsec at the sot focal plane the focal plane package fpp built by the lockheed martin solar and astrophysics laboratory in palo alto california consists of three optical instruments the broadband filter imager bfi which produces images of the solar photosphere and chromosphere in six wide-band interference filters the narrowband filter imager nfi which is a tunable lyot-type birefringent filter capable of producing magnetogram and dopplergram images of the solar surface and the spectropolarimeter sp which produces the most sensitive vector magnetograph maps of the photosphere to date the fpp also includes a correlation tracker ct which locks onto solar granulation to stabilize the sot images to a fraction of an arcsecond the spatial resolution of the sot is a factor of 5 improvement over previous space-based solar telescopes e g the mdi instrument on the soho xrt x-ray telescope a modified wolter i telescope design that uses grazing incidence optics to image the solar corona s hottest components 0.5 to 10 million k with an angular resolution consistent with 1 arcsec pixels at the ccd the telescope has an imaging field of view of 34 arcminutes it is capable of capturing an image of the full sun when pointed at the center of the solar disk the telescope was designed and built by smithsonian astrophysical observatory sao which with the harvard college observatory hco form the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics cfa the camera was developed by naoj and jaxa eis extreme-ultraviolet imaging spectrometer a normal incidence extreme ultraviolet euv spectrometer that obtains spatially resolved spectra in two wavelength bands 17.0-21.2 and 24.6-29.2 nm 4 spatial resolution is around 2 arcsec and the field of view is up to 560 x 512 arcsec 2 the emission lines in the eis wavelength bands are emitted at temperatures ranging from 50,000 k to 20 million k eis is used to identify the physical processes involved in heating
