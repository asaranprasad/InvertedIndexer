several suggested origins for the name one dates to the sumerian city of uruk biblical hebrew erech and is thus ultimately of sumerian origin as uruk was the akkadian name for the sumerian city of urug containing the sumerian word for city ur 9 10 an arabic folk etymology for the name is deeply rooted well-watered fertile 11 during the medieval period there was a region called ir q arab arabian iraq for lower mesopotamia and ir q ajam foreign iraq 12 for the region now situated in central and western iran 13 the term historically included the plain south of the hamrin mountains and did not include the northernmost and westernmost parts of the modern territory of iraq 14 prior to the middle of the 19th century the term eyraca arabic was commonly used to describe iraq 15 the term sawad was also used in early islamic times for the region of the alluvial plain of the tigris and euphrates rivers contrasting it with the arid arabian desert as an arabic word means hem shore bank or edge so that the name by folk etymology came to be interpreted as the escarpment viz at the south and east of the jazira plateau which forms the northern and western edge of the al-iraq arabi area 16 the

begins during the uruk period 4000 bc to 3100 bc with the founding of a number of sumerian cities and the use of pictographs cylinder seals and mass-produced goods 21 the cradle of civilization is thus a common term for the area comprising modern iraq as it was home to the earliest known civilisation the sumerian civilisation which arose in the fertile tigris-euphrates river valley of southern iraq in the chalcolithic ubaid period it was here in the late 4th millennium bc that the world s first writing system and recorded history itself were born the sumerians were also the first to harness the wheel and create city states and whose writings record the first evidence of mathematics astronomy astrology written law medicine and organised religion the language of the sumerians is a language

the north like ashur arbela modern irbil and arrapkha modern kirkuk were also extant in what was to be called assyria from the 25th century bc however at this early stage they were sumerian ruled administrative centres victory stele of naram-sin of akkad bronze age in the 26th century bc eannatum of lagash created what was perhaps the first empire in history though this was short-lived later lugal-zage-si the priest-king of umma overthrew the primacy of the lagash dynasty in the area then conquered uruk making it his capital and claimed an empire extending from the persian gulf to the mediterranean 22 it was during this period that the epic of gilgamesh originates which includes the tale of the great flood from the 29th century bc akkadian semitic names began to appear on king lists and administrative documents of various city states it remains unknown as to the origin of akkad where it was precisely situated and how it rose to prominence its people spoke akkadian an east semitic language 23 during the 3rd millennium bc a cultural symbiosis developed between the sumerians and the akkadians which included widespread bilingualism the influences between sumerian and akkadian are evident in all areas including lexical borrowing on a massive scale and syntactic morphological and phonological convergence this mutual influence has prompted scholars to refer to sumerian and akkadian of the 3rd millennium bc as a sprachbund 24 from this period the civilisation in iraq came to be known as sumero-akkadian bill of sale of a male slave and a building in shuruppak sumerian tablet circa 2600 bc between the 29th and 24th centuries bc a number of kingdoms and city states within iraq began to have akkadian speaking dynasties including assyria ekallatum isin and larsa however the sumerians remained generally dominant until the rise of the akkadian empire 2335 2124 bc based in the city of akkad in central iraq sargon of akkad originally a rabshakeh to a sumerian king founded the empire he conquered all of the city states of southern and central iraq and subjugated the kings of assyria thus uniting the sumerians and akkadians in one state he then set about expanding his empire conquering gutium elam and had victories that did not result into a full conquest against the amorites and eblaites of ancient syria after the collapse of the akkadian empire in the late 22nd century bc the gutians occupied the south for a few decades while assyria reasserted its independence in the north this was followed by a sumerian renaissance in the form of the neo-sumerian empire the sumerians under king shulgi conquered almost all of iraq except the northern reaches of assyria and asserted themselves over the gutians elamites and amorites destroying the first and holding off the others an elamite invasion in 2004 bc brought the sumerian revival to an end by the mid 21st century bc the akkadian speaking kingdom of assyria had risen to dominance in northern iraq assyria expanded territorially into the north eastern levant central iraq and eastern anatolia forming the old assyrian empire circa 2035 1750 bc under kings such as puzur-ashur i sargon i ilushuma and erishum i the latter of whom produced the most detailed set of law yet written citation needed the south broke up into a number of akkadian speaking states isin larsa and eshnunna being the major ones during the 20th century bc the canaanite speaking amorites began to migrate into southern mesopotamia eventually they began to set up small petty kingdoms in the south as well as usurping the thrones of extant city states such as isin larsa and eshnunna hammurabi depicted as receiving his royal insignia from shamash relief on the upper part of the stele of hammurabi s code of laws one of these small amorite kingdoms founded in 1894 bc contained the then small administrative town of babylon within its borders it remained insignificant for over a century overshadowed by older and more powerful states such as assyria elam isin ehnunna and larsa in 1792 bc an amorite ruler named hammurabi came to power in this state and immediately set about building babylon from a minor town into a major city declaring himself its king hammurabi conquered the whole of southern and central iraq as well as elam to the east and mari to the west then engaged in a protracted war with the assyrian king ishme-dagan for domination of the region creating the short-lived babylonian empire he eventually prevailed over the successor of ishme-dagan and subjected assyria and its anatolian colonies by the middle of the eighteenth century bc the sumerians had lost their cultural identity and ceased to exist as a distinct people 25 26 genetic and cultural analysis indicates that the marsh arabs of southern iraq are probably their most direct modern descendants 27 28 29 it is from the period of hammurabi that southern iraq came to be known as babylonia while the north had already coalesced into assyria hundreds of years before however his empire was short-lived and rapidly collapsed after his death with both assyria and southern iraq in the form of the sealand dynasty falling back into native akkadian hands the foreign amorites clung on to power in a once more weak and small babylonia until it was sacked by the indo-european speaking hittite empire based in anatolia in 1595 bc after this another foreign people the language isolate speaking kassites originating in the zagros mountains of ancient iran seized control of babylonia where they were to rule for almost 600 years by far the longest dynasty ever to rule in babylon iraq was from this point divided into three polities assyria in the north kassite babylonia in the south central region and the sealand dynasty in the far south the sealand dynasty was finally conquered by kassite babylonia circa 1380 bc the middle assyrian empire 1365 1020 bc saw assyria rise to be the most powerful nation in the known world beginning with the campaigns of ashur-uballit i assyria destroyed the rival hurrian-mitanni empire annexed huge swathes of the hittite empire for itself annexed northern babylonia from the kassites forced the egyptian empire from the region and defeated the elamites phrygians canaanites phoenicians cilicians gutians dilmunites and arameans at its height the middle assyrian empire stretched from the caucasus to dilmun modern bahrain and from the mediterranean coasts of phoenicia to the zagros mountains of iran in 1235 bc tukulti-ninurta i of assyria took the throne of babylon thus becoming the very first native mesopotamian to rule the state jehu king of israel bows before shalmaneser iii of assyria 825 bc during the bronze age collapse 1200 900 bc babylonia was in a state of chaos dominated for long periods by assyria and elam the kassites were driven from power by assyria and elam allowing native south mesopotamian kings to rule babylonia for the first time although often subject to assyrian or elamite rulers however these east semitic akkadian kings were unable to prevent new waves of west semitic migrants entering southern iraq and during the 11th century bc arameans and suteans entered babylonia from the levant and these were followed in the late 10th to early 9th century bc by the migrant chaldeans who were closely related to the earlier arameans iron age after a period of comparative decline in assyria it once more began to expand with the neo assyrian empire 935 605 bc this was to be the largest empire the region had yet seen and under rulers such as adad-nirari ii ashurnasirpal shalmaneser iii semiramis tiglath-pileser iii sargon ii sennacherib esarhaddon and ashurbanipal iraq became the centre of an empire stretching from persia parthia and elam in the east to cyprus and antioch in the west and from the caucasus in the north to egypt nubia and arabia in the south the arabs and the chaldeans are first mentioned in written history circa 850 bc in the annals of shalmaneser iii it was during this period that an akkadian influenced form of eastern aramaic was adopted by the assyrians as the lingua franca of their vast empire and mesopotamian aramaic began to supplant akkadian as the spoken language of the general populace of both assyria and babylonia the descendant dialects of this tongue survive amongst the mandaeans of southern iraq and assyrians of northern iraq to this day relief showing a lion hunt from the north palace of nineveh 645 635 bc in the late 7th century bc the assyrian empire tore itself apart with a series of brutal civil wars weakening itself to such a degree that a coalition of its former subjects the babylonians chaldeans medes persians parthians scythians and cimmerians were able to attack assyria finally bringing its empire down by 605 bc 30 babylonian and persian periods the short-lived neo-babylonian empire 620 539 bc succeeded that of assyria it failed to attain the size power or longevity of its predecessor however it came to dominate the levant canaan arabia israel and judah and to defeat egypt initially babylon was ruled by yet another foreign dynasty that of the chaldeans who had migrated to the region in the late 10th or early 9th century bc its greatest king nebuchadnezzar ii rivalled another non native ruler the ethnically unrelated amorite king hammurabi as the greatest king of babylon however by 556 bc the chaldeans had been deposed from power by the assyrian born nabonidus and his son and regent belshazzar in the 6th century bc cyrus the great of neighbouring persia defeated the neo-babylonian empire at the battle of opis and iraq was subsumed into the achaemenid empire for nearly two centuries the achaemenids made babylon their main capital the chaldeans and chaldea disappeared at around this time though both assyria and babylonia endured and thrived under achaemenid rule see achaemenid assyria little changed under the persians having spent three centuries under assyrian rule their kings saw themselves as successors to ashurbanipal and they retained assyrian imperial aramaic as the language of empire together with the assyrian imperial infrastructure and an assyrian style of art and architecture citation needed the greek-ruled seleucid empire in yellow with capital in seleucia on the tigris north of babylon in the late 4th century bc alexander the great conquered the region putting it under hellenistic seleucid rule for over two centuries 31 the seleucids introduced the indo-anatolian and greek term syria to the region this name had for many centuries been the indo-european word for assyria and specifically and only meant assyria however the seleucids also applied it to the levant aramea causing both the assyria and

metropolis of the arab and muslim world for five centuries baghdad was the largest multicultural city of the middle ages peaking at a population of more than a million 35 and was the centre of learning during the islamic golden age the mongols destroyed the city and burned its library during the siege of baghdad in the 13th century 36 in 1257 hulagu khan amassed an unusually large army a significant portion of the mongol empire s forces for the purpose of conquering baghdad when they arrived at the islamic capital hulagu khan demanded its surrender but the last abbasid caliph al-musta
