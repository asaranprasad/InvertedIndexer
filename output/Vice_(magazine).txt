global head of content content edit scope edit vice magazine includes the work of journalists columnists fiction writers graphic artists and cartoonists and photographers both vice s online and magazine content has shifted from dealing mostly with independent arts and pop cultural matters to covering more serious news topics due to the large array of contributors and the fact that often writers will only submit a small number of articles with the publication vice s content varies dramatically and its political and cultural stance is often unclear or contradictory articles on the site feature a range of subjects often things not covered as by mainstream media the magazine s editors have championed the immersionist school of journalism which has been passed to other properties of vice media such as the documentary television show balls deep on the viceland channel this style of journalism is regarded as something of a diy antithesis to the methods practiced by mainstream news

asked about the magazine s political allegiances and he stated we re not trying to say anything politically in a paradigmatic left right way we don t do that because we don t believe in either side are my politics democrat or republican i think both are horrific and it doesn t matter anyway money runs america money runs everywhere 4 he has also stated i grew up being a socialist and i have problems with it because i grew up in canada and i ve spent a lot of time in scandinavia where i believe countries legislate out creativity they cut off the tall trees everyone s a c-minus i came to
