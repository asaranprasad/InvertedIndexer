https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet extreme ultraviolet from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search extreme ultraviolet radiation euv or xuv or high-energy ultraviolet radiation is electromagnetic radiation in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum spanning wavelengths from 124 nm down to 10 nm and therefore by the planck einstein equation having photons with energies from 10 ev up to 124 ev corresponding to 124 nm to 10 nm respectively euv is naturally generated by the solar corona and artificially by plasma and synchrotron light sources its main uses are photoelectron spectroscopy solar imaging and lithography in air euv is the most highly absorbed component of the electromagnetic spectrum requiring high vacuum for transmission contents 1 euv generation 2 euv absorption in matter 3 euv damage 4 see also 5 references 6 external links euv generation edit neutral atoms or condensed matter cannot emit euv radiation ionization must take place first euv light can only be emitted by electrons which are bound to multicharged positive ions for example to remove an electron from a 3 charged carbon ion three electrons already removed requires about 65 ev 1 such electrons are more tightly bound than typical valence electrons the existence of multicharged positive ions is only possible in a hot dense plasma alternatively the free electrons and ions may be generated temporarily and instantaneously by the intense electric field of a very-high-harmonic laser beam the electrons accelerate as they return to the parent ion releasing higher energy photons at diminished intensities which may be in the euv range if the released photons constitute ionizing radiation they will also ionize the atoms of the harmonic-generating medium depleting the sources of higher-harmonic generation the freed electrons escape since the electric field of the euv light is not intense enough to drive the electrons to higher harmonics while the parent ions are no longer as easily ionized as the originally neutral atoms hence the processes of euv generation and absorption ionization strongly compete against each other euv light can also be emitted by free electrons orbiting a synchrotron euv absorption in matter edit when an euv photon is absorbed photoelectrons and secondary electrons are generated by ionization much like what happens when x-rays or electron beams are absorbed by matter 2 the response of matter to euv radiation can be captured in the following equations point of absorption euv photon energy 92 ev electron binding energy photoelectron initial kinetic energy within 3 mean free paths of photoelectron 1-2 nm reduction of photoelectron kinetic energy ionization potential secondary electron kinetic energy within 3 mean free paths of secondary electron 30 nm reduction of secondary electron kinetic energy ionization potential tertiary electron kinetic energy nth generation electron slows down aside from ionization by heating phonon generation final generation electron kinetic energy 0 ev dissociative electron attachment heat where the ionization potential is typically 7-9 ev for organic materials and 4-5 ev for metals the photoelectron subsequently causes the emission of secondary electrons through the process of impact ionization sometimes an auger transition is also possible resulting in the emission of two electrons with the absorption of a single photon strictly speaking photoelectrons auger electrons and secondary electrons are all accompanied by positively charged holes ions which can be neutralized by pulling electrons from nearby molecules in order to preserve charge neutrality an electron-hole pair is often referred to as an exciton for highly energetic electrons the electron-hole separation can be quite large and the binding energy is correspondingly low but at lower energy the electron and hole can be closer to each other the exciton itself diffuses quite a large distance 10 nm 3 as the name implies an exciton is an excited state only when it disappears as the electron and hole recombine can stable chemical reaction products form since the photon absorption depth exceeds the electron escape depth as the released electrons eventually slow down they dissipate their energy ultimately as heat euv wavelengths are absorbed much more strongly than longer wavelengths since their corresponding photon energies exceed the bandgaps of all materials consequently their heating efficiency is significantly higher and has been marked by lower thermal ablation thresholds in dielectric materials 4 euv damage edit like other forms of ionizing radiation euv and electrons released directly or indirectly by the euv radiation are a likely source of device damage damage may result from oxide desorption 5 or trapped charge following ionization 6 damage may also occur through indefinite positive charging by the malter effect if free electrons cannot return to neutralize the net positive charge positive ion desorption 7 is the only way to restore neutrality however desorption essentially means the surface is degraded during exposure and furthermore the desorbed atoms contaminate any exposed optics euv damage has already been in the ccd radiation aging of the extreme uv imaging telescope eit 8 radiation damage is a well-known issue that has been studied in the process of plasma processing damage a recent study at the university of wisconsin synchrotron indicated that wavelengths below 200 nm are capable of measurable surface charging 9 euv radiation showed positive charging centimeters beyond the borders of exposure while vuv vacuum ultraviolet radiation showed positive charging within the borders of exposure studies using euv femtosecond pulses at the free electron laser in hamburg flash indicated thermal melting-induced damage thresholds below 100 mj cm2 10 an earlier study 11 showed that electrons produced by the soft ionizing radiation could still penetrate 100 nm below the surface resulting in heating see also edit extreme ultraviolet explorer extreme ultraviolet variability experiment extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope chipsat
