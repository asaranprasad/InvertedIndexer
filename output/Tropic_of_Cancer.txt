zaragoza-victoria km 27 800 of all crossings of the tropic of cancer with mexican federal highways this is the only place where the latitude is marked with precision and where the annual drift between the years 2005 and 2010 can be appreciated the tropic of cancer also referred to as the northern tropic is currently 23 26 12.9 or 23.43693 north of the equator it is the most northerly circle of latitude on earth at which the sun can be directly overhead this occurs on the june solstice when the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun to its maximum extent 1 its southern hemisphere counterpart marking the most southerly position at which the sun can be directly overhead is the tropic of capricorn these tropics are two of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of earth which also includes the arctic and antarctic circles and the equator the positions of these two circles of latitude relative to the equator are dictated by the tilt of earth s rotation around a fixed axis axis of rotation contents 1 name 2 geography 3 climate 4 circumnavigation 5 gallery 6 see also 7 references 8 external links name edit when this line of latitude was named some 2,000 years ago the sun was in the constellation cancer latin for crab at the june solstice the time each year that the sun reaches its zenith at this latitude due to the precession of the equinoxes this is no longer the case today the sun is in taurus at the june solstice the word tropic itself comes from the greek trope meaning turn change of direction or circumstances inclination referring to the fact that the sun appears to turn back at the solstices geography edit map all coordinates using download coordinates as the tropic of cancer s position is not fixed but varies in a complicated manner over time currently it gradually drifts south almost half an arcsecond 0.468 of latitude or 15 metres per year it was at exactly 23 27 in 1917 and will be at 23 26 in 2045 2 see axial tilt and circles of latitude for further information north of the tropic are the subtropics and the north temperate zone the equivalent line of latitude south of the equator is called the tropic of capricorn and the region between the two centered on the equator is the tropics starting at the prime meridian and heading eastward the tropic of cancer passes through 16 countries co-ordinates country territory or sea

of cancer is generally hot and dry except for easterly coastal areas where orographic rainfall can be very heavy in some places reaching 4 metres 160 in most regions on the tropic of cancer experience two distinct seasons an extremely hot summer with temperatures often reaching 45 c 113 f and a warm winter with maxima around 22 c 72 f much land on or near the tropic of cancer is part of the sahara desert whilst to the east the climate is torrid monsoonal with a short wet season from june to september and very little rainfall for the rest of the year the highest mountain on or adjacent to the tropic of cancer is yushan in taiwan though it had glaciers descending as low as 2,800 metres 9,190 ft during the last glacial maximum none survive and at present no glaciers exist within 470 kilometres 290 mi of the tropic of cancer the nearest currently surviving are the minyong and baishui in the himalayas to the north and on iztacc huatl to the south circumnavigation edit according to the rules of the f d ration a ronautique internationale for a flight to compete for a round-the-world speed record it must cover a distance no less than the length of the tropic of cancer cross all meridians and end on the same airfield where it started length of the tropic on 11 december 2015 at 23 26 14 n is 36,788 kilometres 22,859 mi 3 for an ordinary circumnavigation the rules are somewhat relaxed and the distance is set to a rounded value of at least 36,770 kilometres 22,850 mi gallery edit road sign south of dakhla western sahara marking the tropic of cancer the sign was placed by
