https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect greenhouse effect from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a representation of the exchanges of energy between the source the sun earth s surface the earth s atmosphere and the ultimate sink outer space the ability of the atmosphere to capture and recycle energy emitted by earth s surface is the defining characteristic of the greenhouse effect energy flow between the sun the atmosphere and earth s surface earth s energy budget the greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from a planet s atmosphere warms the planet s surface to a temperature above what it would be without its atmosphere 1 2 if a planet s atmosphere contains radiatively active gases i e greenhouse gases they will radiate energy in all directions part of this radiation is directed towards the surface warming it 3 the intensity of the downward radiation that is the strength of the greenhouse effect will depend on the atmosphere s temperature and on the amount of greenhouse gases that the atmosphere contains earth s natural greenhouse effect is critical to supporting life human activities mainly the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests have strengthened the greenhouse effect and caused global warming 4 the term greenhouse effect arose from a faulty analogy with the effect of sunlight passing through glass and warming a greenhouse the way a greenhouse retains heat is fundamentally different as a greenhouse works mostly by reducing airflow so that warm air is kept inside 2 5 6 contents 1 history 2 mechanism

reading 11 external links history the existence of the greenhouse effect was argued for by joseph fourier in 1824 the argument and the evidence were further strengthened by claude pouillet in 1827 and 1838 and reasoned from experimental observations by john tyndall in 1859 who measured the radiative properties of specific greenhouse gases 7 the effect was more fully quantified by svante arrhenius in 1896 who made the first quantitative prediction of global warming due to a hypothetical doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide 8 however the term greenhouse was not used to refer to this effect by any of these scientists the term was first used in this way by nils gustaf ekholm in 1901 9 10 mechanism earth receives energy from the sun in the form of ultraviolet visible and near-infrared radiation about 26 of the incoming solar energy is reflected to space by the atmosphere and clouds and 19 is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds most of the remaining energy is absorbed at the surface of earth because the earth s surface is colder than the sun it radiates at wavelengths that are much longer than the wavelengths that were absorbed most of this thermal radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and warms it the atmosphere also gains heat by sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface the atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards the part radiated downwards is absorbed by the surface of earth this leads to a higher equilibrium temperature than if the atmosphere were absent the solar radiation spectrum for direct light at both the top of earth s atmosphere and at sea level an ideal thermally conductive blackbody at the same distance from the sun as earth would have a temperature of about 5.3 c however because earth reflects about 30 11 12 of the incoming sunlight this idealized planet s effective temperature the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same amount of radiation would be about 18 c 13 14 the surface temperature of this hypothetical planet is 33 c below earth s actual surface temperature of approximately 14 c 15 the basic mechanism can be qualified in a number of ways none of which affect the fundamental process the atmosphere near the surface is largely opaque to thermal radiation with important exceptions for window bands and most heat loss from the surface is by sensible heat and latent heat transport radiative energy losses become increasingly important higher in the atmosphere largely because of the decreasing concentration of water vapor an important greenhouse gas it is more realistic to think of the greenhouse effect as applying to a surface in the mid-troposphere which is effectively coupled to the surface by a lapse rate the simple picture also assumes a steady state but in the real world there are variations due to the diurnal cycle as well as the seasonal cycle and weather disturbances solar heating only applies during daytime during the night the atmosphere cools somewhat but not greatly because its emissivity is low diurnal temperature changes decrease with height in the atmosphere within the region where radiative effects are important the description given by the idealized greenhouse model becomes realistic earth s surface warmed to a temperature around 255 k radiates long-wavelength infrared heat in the range of 4 100 m 16 at these wavelengths greenhouse gases that were largely transparent to incoming solar radiation are more absorbent 16 each layer of atmosphere with greenhouses gases absorbs some of the heat being radiated upwards from lower layers it reradiates in all directions both upwards and downwards in equilibrium by definition the same amount as it has absorbed this results in more warmth below increasing the concentration of the gases increases the amount of absorption and reradiation and thereby further warms the layers and ultimately the surface below 14 greenhouse gases including most diatomic gases with two different atoms such as carbon monoxide co and all gases with three or more atoms are able to absorb and emit infrared radiation though more than 99 of the dry atmosphere is ir transparent because the main constituents n2 o2 and ar are not able to directly absorb or emit infrared radiation intermolecular collisions cause the energy absorbed and emitted by the greenhouse gases to be shared with the other non-ir-active gases greenhouse gases by their percentage contribution to the greenhouse effect on earth the four major gases are 17 18 atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others the absorption patterns of water vapor blue peaks and carbon dioxide pink peaks overlap in some wavelengths carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor but it absorbs energy in longer wavelengths 12 15 micrometers that water vapor does not partially closing the window through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space illustration nasa robert rohde 19 water vapor 36 70 carbon dioxide 9 26 methane 4 9 ozone 3 7 it is not possible to assign a specific percentage to each gas because the absorption and emission bands of the gases overlap hence the ranges given above clouds also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus affect the radiative properties of the atmosphere 18 role in climate change the keeling curve of atmospheric co 2 concentrations measured at mauna loa observatory strengthening of the greenhouse effect through human activities is known as the enhanced or anthropogenic greenhouse effect 20 this increase in radiative forcing from human activity is attributable mainly to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels 21 according to the latest assessment report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years their effects together with those of other anthropogenic drivers have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century 22 co2 is produced by fossil fuel burning and other activities such as cement production and tropical deforestation 23 measurements of co2 from the mauna loa observatory show that concentrations have increased from about 313 parts per million ppm 24 in 1960 to about 389 ppm in 2010 it reached the 400 ppm milestone on may 9 2013 25 the current observed amount of co2 exceeds the geological record maxima 300 ppm from ice core data 26 the effect of combustion-produced carbon dioxide on the global climate a special case of the greenhouse effect first described in 1896 by svante arrhenius has also been called the callendar effect over the past 800,000 years 27 ice core data shows that carbon dioxide has varied from values as low as 180 ppm to the pre-industrial level of 270 ppm 28 paleoclimatologists consider variations in carbon dioxide concentration to be a fundamental factor influencing climate variations over this time scale 29 30 real greenhouses a modern greenhouse in rhs wisley the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere is named by analogy to greenhouses which become warmer in sunlight however a greenhouse is not primarily warmed by the greenhouse effect 31 greenhouse effect is actually a misnomer since heating in the usual greenhouse is due to the reduction of convection 32 while the greenhouse effect works by preventing absorbed heat from leaving the structure through radiative transfer a greenhouse is built of any material that passes sunlight usually glass or plastic the sun warms the ground and contents inside just like the outside which then warms the air outside the warm air near the surface rises and mixes with cooler air aloft keeping the temperature lower than inside where the air continues to heat up because it is confined within the greenhouse this can be demonstrated by opening a small window near the roof of a greenhouse the temperature will drop considerably it was demonstrated experimentally r w wood 1909 that a not heated greenhouse with a cover of rock salt which is transparent to infrared heats up an enclosure similarly to one with a glass cover 6 thus greenhouses work primarily by preventing convective cooling 5 heated greenhouses are yet another matter having an internal source of heating they leak heat out which must be prevented so it again makes sense to try to prevent radiative cooling through the use of adequate glazing 33 related effects anti-greenhouse effect the anti-greenhouse effect is a mechanism similar and symmetrical to the greenhouse effect greenhouse effect is about atmosphere letting radiation in while not letting thermal radiation out which warms the body surface anti-greenhouse effect is about atmosphere not letting radiation in while letting thermal radiation out which lowers the equilibrium surface temperature such an effect has been cited about titan 34 runaway greenhouse effect a runaway greenhouse effect occurs if positive feedbacks lead to the evaporation of all greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 35 a runaway greenhouse effect involving carbon dioxide and water vapor has long ago been hypothesized to have occurred on venus 36 this idea is still largely accepted citation needed bodies other than earth the greenhouse effect on venus is particularly large because its dense atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide 37 venus experienced a runaway greenhouse in the past and we expect that earth will in about 2 billion years as solar luminosity increases 38 titan has an anti-greenhouse effect in that its atmosphere absorbs solar radiation but is relatively transparent to outgoing infrared radiation pluto is also colder than would be expected because evaporation of nitrogen cools it 39 see also earth s energy budget references intergovernmental panel on climate change retrieved 15 october 2010 a b a concise description of the greenhouse effect is given in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fourth assessment report what is the greenhouse effect iipcc fourth assessment report chapter 1 page 115 to balance the absorbed incoming solar energy the earth must on average radiate the same amount of energy back to space because the earth is much colder than the sun it radiates at much longer wavelengths primarily in the infrared part of the spectrum see figure 1 much of this thermal radiation emitted by the land and ocean is absorbed by the atmosphere including clouds and reradiated back

enclosure covered with the salt plate keeping a little ahead of the other because it transmitted the longer waves from the sun which were stopped by the glass in order to eliminate this action the sunlight was first passed through a glass plate it is clear that the rock-salt plate is capable of transmitting practically all of it while the glass plate stops it entirely this shows us that the loss of temperature of the ground by radiation is very small in comparison to the loss by convection in other words that we gain very little from the circumstance that the radiation is trapped john
