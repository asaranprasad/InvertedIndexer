image of planet earth made on december 7 1972 by the crew of the apollo 17 spacecraft at a distance of about 29,000 kilometers 18,000 miles from the surface 1 2 3 it is one of the most reproduced images in human history 4 5 the image with the official nasa designation as17-148-22727 6 reproduces the view of the earth as seen by the apollo crew traveling toward the moon the translunar coast photograph extends from the mediterranean sea to antarctica this was the first time the apollo trajectory made it possible to photograph the south polar ice cap despite the southern hemisphere being heavily covered in clouds in addition to the arabian peninsula and madagascar almost the entire coastline of africa is clearly visible the asian mainland is on the horizon the name has also been applied by nasa to a 2012 series of image data sets covering the entire globe at relatively high resolution created by carefully sifting through satellite-captured sequences taken over time to eliminate as much cloud cover as possible from the collated set of images contents 1 the photograph 1.1 history 2 subsequent blue marble images 2.1 imaging series 2001 2004 2.2 blue marble 2012 2.3

1972 at 05 39 a m est 10 39 utc is one of the most widely distributed photographic images in existence 5 the image is one of the few to show an almost fully illuminated earth disk as the astronauts had the sun behind them when they took the image to the astronauts the slightly gibbous earth had the appearance and size of a glass marble hence the name history edit the photograph was originally taken upside down to what was widely distributed the image was flipped to fit expectations of north-up orientation the photograph was taken about 5 hours and 6 minutes after launch of the apollo 17 mission 7 and about 1 hour 54 minutes after the spacecraft left its parking orbit around earth to begin its trajectory to the moon the time of apollo 17 s launch 12 33 a m est meant that africa was in daylight during the early hours of the spacecraft s flight with the december solstice approaching antarctica was also illuminated the 1972 tamil nadu cyclone can be seen in the top right of the image this storm had brought flooding and high winds to the indian state of tamil nadu on december 5 two days before the photograph was taken 8 the photograph s official nasa designation is as17-148-22727 nasa photograph as17-148-22726 taken just before and nearly identical to 22727 is also used as a full-earth image 9 the photographer used a 70-millimeter hasselblad camera with an 80-millimeter zeiss lens 10 11 nasa credits the image to the entire apollo 17 crew eugene cernan ronald evans and jack schmitt all of whom took photographs during the mission with the on-board hasselblad although evidence examined after the mission suggests that jack schmitt was the photographer 5 apollo 17 was the last manned lunar mission no human since has been far enough from earth to photograph a whole-earth image such as the blue marble but whole-earth images have been taken by many unmanned spacecraft missions 12 the blue marble was not the first clear image taken of an illuminated face of earth since similar shots from the ats-3 satellite had already been made as early as 1967 13 the apollo 17 image however released during a surge in environmental activism during the 1970s became a symbol of the environmental movement as a depiction of earth s frailty vulnerability and isolation amid the vast expanse of space 4 nasa archivist mike gentry has speculated that the blue marble is among the most widely distributed images in human history 5 subsequent blue marble images edit subsequent similar images of earth including composites at much higher resolution have also been termed blue marble images and the phrase blue marble as well as the picture itself is frequently used as in the earth flag by environmental activist organizations or companies attempting to promote an environmentally conscious image there has also been a children s television program called big blue marble poet-diplomat abhay k has penned an earth anthem inspired by the blue marble which contains all the peoples and the nations of the world one for all all for one united we unfurl the blue marble flag 14 better source needed imaging series 2001 2004 edit blue marble composite images generated by nasa in 2001 and 2002 nasa earth observatory animation of blue marble next generation 2004 15 in 2002 nasa released an extensive set of satellite-captured imagery including prepared images suitable for direct human viewing as well as complete sets suitable for use in preparing further works 16 at the time 1 km pixel was the most detailed imagery available for free and permitted for reuse 17 without a need for extensive preparatory work to eliminate cloud cover and conceal missing data or to parse specialized data formats the data also included a similarly manually assembled cloud-cover and night-lights image sets at lower resolutions a subsequent release was made in 2005 named blue marble next generation 18 this series of photo mosaics was produced with the aid of automated image-sifting upon images from nasa s earth observatory which enabled the inclusion of a complete cloud-free globe for each month from january to december 2004 at even higher resolution 500 m pixel 19 the original release of a single-image set covering the entire globe could not reflect the extent of seasonal snow-and-vegetative cover across both hemispheres but this newer release closely modeled the changes of the seasons a number of interactive viewers for these data have also been released among them a music visualization for the ps3 that is based on the texture data 20 21 blue marble 2012 edit blue marble 2012 a composite satellite image on january 25 2012 nasa released a composite image of the western hemisphere of earth entitled blue marble 2012 the picture logged over 3.1 million views on the flickr image hosting website within the first week of release 22 on february 2 2012 nasa released a companion to this new blue marble showing a composite image of the eastern hemisphere from data obtained on january 23 2012 23 the picture is composed of data obtained by the visible infrared imager radiometer suite viirs instrument on board the suomi npp satellite on january 4 2012 23 24 the data was obtained from six orbits of the earth by the suomi npp over an eight-hour period 23 the image was created using a with the viewing point placed 2100 km above 20 north by 100 west this projection results in a very wide-angle presentation such as one might get with a fish-eye lens and it does not include the whole hemisphere black marble 2012 edit black marble north and south america at night 25 on december 5 2012 nasa released a nighttime view of earth called black marble 25 during an annual meeting of earth scientists held by the american geophysical union in san francisco 26 the images display all the human and natural matter that glows and can be detected from space 27 the data was acquired by the suomi npp satellite in april and october 2012 and then mapped over existing blue marble imagery of earth to provide a realistic view of the planet 28 the suomi npp satellite completed 312 orbits and gathered 2.5 terabytes of data to get a clear shot of every parcel of the earth s land surface named for satellite meteorology pioneer verner suomi the satellite flies over any given point on earth s surface twice each day and flies 512 miles 824 km above the surface in a polar orbit 29 the nighttime views were obtained with the new satellite s day-night band of the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as city lights gas flares auroras wildfires and reflected moonlight auroras fires and other stray light have been removed in the case of the black marble images to emphasize the city lights 28 the images have been used to study the spatial distribution of economic activity to select sites for astronomical observatories and to monitor human activities around protected areas 28 dscovr edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help by adding citations to reliable sources
