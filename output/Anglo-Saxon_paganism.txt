sei r v lva related topics heathenry v t developing from the earlier iron age religion of continental northern europe it was introduced to britain following the anglo-saxon migration in the mid 5th century and remained the dominant belief system in england until the christianisation of its kingdoms between the 7th and 8th centuries with some aspects gradually blending into folklore the pejorative terms paganism and heathenism were first applied to this religion by christian anglo-saxons and it does not appear that these pagans had a name for their religion themselves there has therefore been debate among contemporary scholars as to the appropriateness of continuing to describe these belief systems using this christian terminology contemporary knowledge of anglo-saxon paganism derives largely from three sources textual evidence produced by christian anglo-saxons like bede and aldhelm place-name evidence and archaeological evidence of cultic practices further suggestions regarding the nature of anglo-saxon paganism have been developed through comparisons with the better-attested pre-christian belief systems of neighbouring peoples such as the norse anglo-saxon paganism was a polytheistic belief system focused around a belief in deities known as the se singular s the most prominent of these deities was probably woden other prominent gods included thunor and tiw there was also a belief in a variety of other supernatural entities which inhabited the landscape including elves nicor and dragons cultic practice largely revolved around demonstrations of devotion including sacrifice of inanimate objects and animals to these deities particularly at certain religious festivals during the year there is some evidence for the existence of timber temples although other cultic spaces might have been open-air and would have included cultic trees and megaliths little is known about pagan conceptions of an afterlife although such beliefs likely influenced funerary practices in which the dead were either inhumed or cremated typically with a selection of grave goods the belief system also likely included ideas about magic and witchcraft and elements that could be classified as a form of shamanism the deities of this religion provided the basis for the names of the days of the week in the english language what is known about the

in modern english the word pagan is a latin term that was used by christians in anglo-saxon england to designate non-christians 1 in old english the vernacular language of anglo-saxon england the equivalent term was h en heathen a word that was cognate to the old norse hei inn both of which may derive from a gothic word hai no 2 both pagan and heathen were terms that carried pejorative overtones 3 with h en also being used in late anglo-saxon texts to refer to criminals and others deemed to have not behaved according to christian teachings 4 the term paganism was one used by christians as a form of othering 5 and as the archaeologist neil price put it in the anglo-saxon context paganism is largely an empty concept defined by what it is not christianity 6 there is no evidence that anyone living in anglo-saxon england ever described themselves as a pagan or understood there to be a singular religion paganism that stood as a monolithic alternative to christianity 5 these pagan belief systems would have been inseparable from other aspects of daily life 7 according to the archaeologists martin carver alex sanmark and sarah semple anglo-saxon paganism was not a religion with supraregional rules and institutions but a loose term for a variety of local intellectual world views 8 carver stressed that in anglo-saxon england neither paganism nor christianity represented homogenous intellectual positions or canons and practice instead there was considerable interdigitation between the two 9 as a phenomenon this belief system lacked any apparent rules or consistency and exhibited both regional and chronological variation 6 the archaeologist aleks pluskowski suggested that it is possible to talk of multiple anglo-saxon paganisms 7 adopting the terminology of the sociologist of religion max weber the historian marilyn dunn described anglo-saxon paganism as a world accepting religion one which was concerned with the here and now and in particular with issues surrounding the safety of the family prosperity and the avoidance of drought or famine 10 also adopting the categories of gustav mensching she described anglo-saxon paganism as a folk religion in that its adherents concentrated on survival and prosperity in this world 10 using the expressions paganism or heathenism when discussing pre-christian belief systems in anglo-saxon england is problematic 5 historically many early scholars of the anglo-saxon period used these terms to describe the religious beliefs in england before its conversion to christianity in the 7th century 5 several later scholars criticised this approach 5 as the historian ian s wood stated using the term pagan when discussing the anglo-saxons forces the scholar to adopt the cultural constructs and value judgements of the early medieval christian missionaries and thus obscures scholarly understandings of the so-called pagans own perspectives 11 at present while some anglo-saxonists have ceased using the terms paganism or pagan when discussing the early anglo-saxon period others have continued to do so viewing these terms as a useful means of designating something that is not christian yet which is still identifiably religious 5 the historian john hines proposed traditional religion as a better alternative 5 although carver cautioned against this noting that britain in the 5th to the 8th century was replete with new ideas and thus belief systems of that period were not particularly traditional 12 the term pre-christian religion has also been used this avoids the judgemental connotations of paganism and heathenism but is not always chronologically accurate 13 evidence edit an early 20th century depiction of bede who provides much of the textual information on anglo-saxon paganism the pre-christian society of anglo-saxon england was illiterate 14 thus there is no contemporary written evidence produced by anglo-saxon pagans themselves 15 instead our primary textual source material derives from later authors such as bede and the anonymous author of the life of st wilfrid who wrote in latin rather than in old english 16 these writers were not interested in providing a full portrait of the anglo-saxons pre-christian belief systems and thus our textual portrayal of these religious beliefs is fragmentary and incidental 17 also perhaps useful are the writings of those christian anglo-saxon missionaries who were active in converting the pagan societies of continental europe namely willibrord and boniface 18 as well as the writings of the 1st century ad roman writer tacitus who commented upon the pagan religions of the anglo-saxons ancestors in continental europe 19 the historian frank stenton commented that the available texts only provide us with a dim impression of pagan religion in anglo-saxon england 20 while similarly the archaeologist david wilson commented that written sources should be treated with caution and viewed as suggestive rather than in any way definitive 21 far fewer textual records discuss anglo-saxon paganism than the pre-christian belief systems found in nearby ireland francia or scandinavia 22 there is no neat formalised account of anglo-saxon pagan beliefs as there is for instance for classical mythology and norse mythology 23 although many scholars have used norse mythology as a guide to understanding the beliefs of pre-christian anglo-saxon england caution has been expressed as to the utility of this approach 24 as stenton noted the connection between anglo-saxon and scandinavian paganism occurred in a past which was already remote at the time of the anglo-saxon migration to britain 25 moreover there was clear diversity among the pre-christian belief systems of scandinavia itself further complicating the use of scandinavian material to understand that of england 26 conversely the historian brian branston argued for the use of old norse sources to better understand anglo-saxon pagan beliefs recognising what he perceived as mythological commonalities between the two rooted in their common ancestry 27 old english place-names also provide some insight into the pre-christian beliefs and practices of anglo-saxon england 28 some of these place-names reference the names of particular deities while others use terms that refer to cultic practices that took place there 29 in england these two categories remain separate unlike in scandinavia where certain place-names exhibit both features 30 those place-names which carry possible pagan associations are centred primarily in the centre and south-east of england 31 while no obvious examples are known from northumbria or east anglia 32 it is not clear why such names are rarer or non-existent in certain parts of the country it may be due to changes in nomenclature brought about by scandinavian settlement in the late anglo-saxon period or because of evangelising efforts by later christian authorities 33 in 1941 stenton suggested that between fifty and sixty sites of heathen worship could by identified through the place-name evidence 34 although in 1961 the place-name scholar margaret gelling cautioned that only forty-five of these appeared reliable 35 the literature specialist philip a shaw has however warned that many of these sites might not have been named by pagans but by later christian anglo-saxons reflecting spaces that were perceived to be heathen from a christian perspective 36 although our understanding of anglo-saxon pre-christian religion from written sources and from place names is partial and far from complete archaeology is beginning to reveal more archaeologist martin welch 2011 37 according to wilson the archaeological evidence is prolific and hence is potentially the most useful in the study of paganism in anglo-saxon england 38 archaeologically the realms of religion ritual and magic can only be identified if they affected material culture 39 as such scholarly understandings of pre-christian religion in anglo-saxon england are reliant largely on rich burials and monumental buildings which exert as much of a political purpose as a religious one 39 metalwork items discovered by metal detectorists have also contributed to the interpretation of anglo-saxon paganism 40 the world-views of the pre-christian anglo-saxons would have impinged on all aspects of everyday life making it particularly difficult for modern scholars to separate anglo-saxon ritual activities as something distinct from other areas of daily life 41 much of this archaeological material comes from the period in which pagan beliefs were being supplanted by christianity and thus an understanding of anglo-saxon paganism must be seen in tandem with the archaeology of the conversion 42 based on the evidence available the historian john blair stated that the pre-christian religion of anglo-saxon england largely resembled that of the pagan britons under roman rule at least in its outward forms 43 however the archaeologist audrey meaney concluded that there exists very little undoubted evidence for anglo-saxon paganism and we remain ignorant of many of its essential features of organisation and philosophy 44 similarly the old english specialist roy page expressed the view that the surviving evidence was too sparse and too scattered to permit a good understanding of anglo-saxon paganism 45 historical development edit arrival and establishment edit during most of the fourth century the majority of britain had been part of the roman empire which had christianity as its official religion 46 however in britain christianity was probably still a minority religion restricted largely to the urban centres and their hinterlands 46 while it did have some impact in the countryside here it appears that indigenous late iron age polytheistic belief systems continued to be widely practised 46 some areas such as the welsh marches the majority of wales excepting gwent lancashire and the south-western peninsula are totally lacking evidence for christianity in this period 46 britons who found themselves in the areas now dominated by anglo-saxon elites possibly embraced the anglo-saxons pagan religion in order to aid their own self-advancement just as they adopted other trappings of anglo-saxon culture 47 this would have been easier for those britons who rather than being christian continued to practise indigenous polytheistic belief systems 47 and in areas this late iron age polytheism could have syncretically mixed with the incoming anglo-saxon religion 48 conversely there is weak possible evidence for limited survival of roman christianity into the anglo-saxon period such as the place-name eccl s meaning church at two locations in norfolk and eccles in kent 47 however blair suggested that roman christianity would not have experienced more than a ghost-life in anglo-saxon areas 47 those britons who continued to practise christianity were probably perceived as second-class citizens and were unlikely to have had much of an impact on the pagan kings and aristocracy which was then emphasising anglo-saxon culture and defining itself against british culture 49 if the british christians were able to convert any of the anglo-saxon elite conquerors it was likely only on a small community scale with british christianity having little impact on the later establishment of anglo-saxon christianity in the seventh century 50 prior scholarship tended to view anglo-saxon paganism as a development from an older germanic paganism the scholar michael bintley cautioned against this approach noting that this germanic paganism had never had a single ur-form from which later variants developed 51 the conversion to christianity edit anglo-saxon paganism only existed for a relatively short time-span from the fifth to the eighth centuries 42 our knowledge of the christianisation process derives from christian textual sources as the pagans were illiterate 52 in 596 pope gregory i ordered a gregorian mission to be launched in order to convert the anglo-saxons to the roman catholic denomination of christianity 53 the leader of this mission augustine probably landed in thanet then part of the kingdom of kent in the summer of 597 53 while christianity was initially restricted to kent it saw major and sustained expansion in the period from c 625 to 642 when the kentish king eadbald sponsored a mission to the northumbrians led by paulinus the northumbrian king oswald invited a christian mission from irish monks to establish themselves and the courts of the east anglians and the gewisse were converted by continental missionaries felix the burgundian and birinus the italian 54 the next phase of the conversion took place between c.653 and 664 and entailed the northumbrian sponsored conversion of the rulers of the east saxons middle anglians and mercians 54 in the final phase of the conversion which took place during the 670s and 680s the final two anglo-saxon kingdoms to be led by pagan rulers in sussex and the isle of wight saw their leaders baptised 54 as with other areas of europe the conversion to christianity was facilitated by the aristocracy 55 these rulers may have felt themselves to be members of a pagan backwater in contrast to the christian kingdoms in continental europe 56 the pace of christian conversion varied across anglo-saxon england 42 with it taking almost 90 years for the official conversion to succeed 57 most of the anglo-saxon kingdoms returned to paganism for a time after the death of their first converted king 42 however by the end of the 680s all of the anglo-saxon peoples were at least nominally christian 54 blair noted that for most anglo-saxons the moral and practical imperatives of following one s lord by converting to christianity were a powerful stimulus 58 it remains difficult to determine the extent to which pre-christian beliefs retained their popularity among the anglo-saxon populace from the seventh century onward 59 theodore s penitential and the laws of wihtred of kent issued in 695 imposed penalties on those who provided offerings to demons 22 however by two or three decades later bede could write as if paganism had died out in anglo-saxon england 60 condemnations of pagan cult also do not appear in other canons from this later period again suggesting that ecclesiastical figures no longer considered persisting paganism to be a problem 60 scandinavian incursions edit in the latter decades of the ninth century during the late anglo-saxon period scandinavian settlers arrived in britain bringing with them their own pre-christian beliefs 61 no cultic sites used by scandinavian pagans have been archaeologically identified although place names suggest some possible examples 62 for instance roseberry topping in north yorkshire was known as othensberg in the twelfth century a name which derived from the old norse insberg or hill of in 63 a number of place-names also contain old norse references to mythological entities such as alfr skratii and troll 64 a number of pendants representing mjolnir the hammer of the god thor have also been found in england reflecting the probability that he was worshipped among the anglo-scandinavian population 65 jesch argued that given that there was only evidence for the worship of odin and thor in anglo-scandinavian england these might have been the only deities to have been actively venerated by the scandinavian settlers even if they were aware of the mythological stories surrounding other norse gods and goddesses 66 north however argued that one passage in the old english rune poem written in the eighth or ninth century may reflect knowledge of the scandinavian god t r 67 roseberry topping in yorkshire once known as the hill of in archaeologically the introduction of norse paganism to britain in this period is mostly visited in the mortuary evidence 68 a number of scandinavian furnished burial styles were also introduced that differed from the christian churchyard burials then dominant in late anglo-saxon england whether these represent clear pagan identity or not is however debated among archaeologists 69 norse mythological scenes have also been identified on a number of stone carvings from the period such as the gosforth cross which included images of ragnarok 70 the english church found itself in need of conducting a new conversion process to christianise this incoming population 71 it is not well understood how the christian institutions converted these scandinavian settlers in part due to a lack of textual descriptions of this conversion process equivalent to bede s description of the earlier anglo-saxon conversion 72 however it appears that the scandinavian migrants had converted to christianity within the first few decades of their arrival 68 the historian judith jesch suggested that these beliefs survived throughout late anglo-saxon england not in the form of an active non-christian religion but as cultural paganism the acceptance of references to pre-christian myths in particular cultural contexts within an officially christian society 73 such cultural paganism could represent a reference to the cultural heritage of the scandinavian population rather than their religious heritage 74 for instance many norse mythological themes and motifs are present in the poetry composed for the court of cnut the great an eleventh-century anglo-scandinavian king who had been baptised into christianity and who otherwise emphasised his identity as a christian monarch 75 folkloric influence edit the pagan hierarchical structure disintegrated rapidly in the seventh century in the face of christianity s systematic organization but folk practices were all-pervasive in everyday life the animistic character of germanic belief prior to christianization with its emphasis on nature holistic cures and worship at wells trees and stones meant that it was hard to counteract on an institutional level of organized religion the synthesis of christian and germanic ideas gradually transformed these practices undoubtedly at the local level in this way christianity ultimately penetrated the homes and daily lives of the various germanic peoples in the centuries after the arrival of the first missionaries historian karen louise jolly 1996 76 although christianity had been adopted across anglo-saxon england by the late seventh century many pre-christian customs continued to be practiced 77 bintley argued that aspects of anglo-saxon paganism served as the foundations for parts of anglo-saxon christianity 78 pre-christian beliefs affected the folklore of the anglo-saxon period and through this continued to exert an influence on popular religion within the late anglo-saxon period 79 the conversion did not result in the obliteration of pre-christian traditions but resulted in various ways created a synthesis of traditions as exhibited for instance by the franks casket an artwork depicting both the pre-christian myth of weland the smith and the christian myth of the adoration of the magi 80 blair noted that even in the late eleventh century important aspects of lay christianity were still influenced by traditional indigenous practices 81 both secular and church authorities issued condemnations of alleged non-christian pagan practices such as the veneration of wells trees and stones right through to the eleventh century and into the high middle ages 77 however most of the penitentials condemning such practices notably that attributed to ecgbert of york were largely produced around the year 1000 which may suggest that their prohibitions against non-christian cultic behaviour may be a response to norse pagan beliefs brought in by scandinavian settlers rather than a reference to older anglo-saxon practices 77 various scholars among them historical geographer della hooke and price have contrastingly believed that these reflected the continuing practice of veneration at wells and trees at a popular level long after the official christianisation of anglo-saxon society 82 various elements of english folklore from the mediaeval period onwards have been interpreted as being survivals from anglo-saxon paganism for instance writing in the 1720s henry bourne stated his belief that the winter custom of the yule log was a leftover from anglo-saxon paganism however this is an idea that has been disputed by some subsequent research by the likes of historian ronald hutton who believe that it was only introduced into england in the seventeenth century by immigrants arriving from flanders 83 the abbots bromley horn dance which is performed annually in the village of abbots bromley in staffordshire has also been claimed by some to be a remnant of anglo-saxon paganism the antlers used in the dance belonged to reindeer and have been carbon dated to the eleventh century and it is therefore believed that they originated in norway and were brought to england some time in the late mediaeval period as by that time reindeer were extinct in britain 84 mythology edit cosmology edit little is known about the cosmological beliefs of anglo-saxon paganism 85 carver sanmark and semple suggested that every community within anglo-saxon england likely had its own take on cosmology although suggested that there might have been an underlying system that was widely shared 8 the later anglo-saxon nine herbs charm mentions seven worlds which may be a reference to an earlier pagan cosmological belief 85 similarly bede claimed that the christian king oswald of northumbria defeated a pagan rival at a sacred plain or meadow called heavenfield hefenfelth which may be a reference to a pagan belief in a heavenly plain 85 the anglo-saxon concept corresponding to fate was wyrd 86 although the pagan nature of this conception is subject to some debate dorothy whitelock suggested that it was a belief held only after christianisation 87 while branston maintained that wyrd had been an important concept for the pagan anglo-saxons 88 he suggested that it was cognate to the icelandic term urdr and thus was connected to the concept of three sisters the nornir who oversee fate in recorded norse mythology 89 it is possible that the pre-christian anglo-saxons held a belief in an apocalypse that bore similarities with the later norse myth of ragnarok 90 although we have no evidence directly testifying to the existence of such a belief the possibility that the pre-christian anglo-saxons believed in a cosmological world tree has also been considered 91 it has been suggested that the idea of a world tree can be discerned through certain references in the dream of the rood poem 92 this idea may be bolstered if it is the case as some scholars have argued that the concept of a world tree derived from a prehistoric indo-european society and thus can be found throughout those societies who descended from the indo-europeans 93 the historian clive tolley has cautioned that any anglo-saxon world tree would likely not be directly comparable to that referenced in norse textual sources 93 deities edit the world of the anglo-saxon gods will forever remain a mystery to us existing just beyond the reach of written history this pagan world sits in an enigmatic realm that is in many respects prehistoric an alien headspace far removed from our own intellectual universe situated within a polytheistic cosmos clouded from us by centuries of christian theology and enlightenment rationalism we can discern the existence of a handful of potential deities who though long deceased have perhaps left their mark in place-names royal genealogies and the accounts of proselytizing monks such sources have led scholars to put together a pantheon for early medieval england populated by such murky figures as woden unor tiw and frig historian ethan doyle white 2014 94 anglo-saxon paganism was a polytheistic belief system with its practitioners believing in many deities 95 however most christian anglo-saxon writers had little or no interest in the pagan gods and thus did not discuss them in their texts 96 the old english words for a god were s and s and they may be reflected in such place-names as easole god s ridge in kent and eisey god s island in wiltshire 97 the deity for which we have most evidence is woden as traces of his cult are scattered more widely over the rolling english countryside than those of any other heathen deity 98 place names containing wodnes- or wednes- as their first element have been interpreted as references to woden 99 and as a result his name is often seen as the basis for such place names as woodnesborough woden s barrow in kent wansdyke woden s dyke in wiltshire and wensley woden s woodland clearing or woden s wood in derbyshire 100 the name woden also appears as an ancestor of the royal genealogies of kent wessex east anglia and mercia resulting in suggestions that after losing his status as a god during the christianisation process he was euhemerised as a royal ancestor 101 102 woden also appears as the leader of the wild hunt 103 and he is referred to as a magical healer in the nine herbs charm directly paralleling the role of his continental german counterpart wodan in the merseburg incantations 104 102 he is also often interpreted as being cognate with the norse god inn and the old high german uuodan 105 it has been suggested that woden was also known as grim a name which appears in such english place-names as grimspound in dartmoor and grimes graves in norfolk because in recorded norse mythology the god inn is also known as gr mnir 106 highlighting that there are around twice as many grim place-names in england as woden place-names the place-name scholar margaret gelling cautioned against the view that grim was always associated with woden in anglo-saxon england 107 the second most widespread deity from anglo-saxon england appears to be the god thunor it has been suggested that the hammer and the swastika were the god s symbols representing thunderbolts and both of these symbols have been found in anglo-saxon graves the latter being common on cremation urns 108 a large number of thunor place-names feature the old english word l ah wood or clearing in a wood among them thunderley and thundersley in essex 109 the deity s name also appears in other compounds too as with thunderfield thor s open land in surrey and thunores hlaew thor s mound in kent 110 a third anglo-saxon god that is attested is tiw who in the anglo-saxon rune poem tir is identified with the star polaris rather than with a deity although it has been suggested that tiw was probably a war deity 111 dunn has suggested that tiw might have been a supreme creator deity who was nevertheless deemed distant 112 the name tiw has been identified in such place-names as tuesley tiw s wood or clearing in surrey tysoe tiw s hill-spur in warwickshire and tyesmere tiw s pool in worcestershire 113 it has been suggested that the t -rune which appears on some weapons and crematory urns from the anglo-saxon period may be references to tiw 114 a worm came creeping he tore a man in two then woden took nine glory-twigs then struck the adder that it flew apart into nine bits woden established the nine herbs and sent them into the seven worlds for the poor and the rich a remedy for all it stands against pain it fights against poison it avails against three and against thirty against foe s hand and against noble scheming against enchantment of vile creatures the nine herbs charm 115 perhaps the most prominent female deity in anglo-saxon paganism was frig however there is still very little evidence for her worship although it has been speculated that she was a goddess of love or festivity 111 her name has been suggested as a component of the place-names frethern in gloucestershire and freefolk frobury and froyle in hampshire 116 another anglo-saxon divinity was frey who is mentioned in both the dream of the rood and a poem by the monk c dmon in both of which he is compared to the later christian figure jesus christ indicating that frey was perhaps a sacrificial deity 111 the east saxon royalty claimed lineage from an entity known as seaxn at who might have been a god in part because an old saxon baptismal vow calls on the christian to renounce thunaer woden and saxnot 117 118 a runic poem mentions a god known as ingui and the writer asser mentioned a god known as g at 118 the christian monk known as the venerable bede also mentioned two further goddesses in his written works eostre who was celebrated at a spring festival and hretha whose name meant glory 119 118 references to idols can be found in anglo-saxon texts 120 no wooden carvings of anthropomorphic figures have been found in the area that once encompassed anglo-saxon england that are comparable to those found in scandinavia or continental europe 121 it may be that such sculptures were typically made out of wood which has not survived in the archaeological record 122 several anthropomorphic images have been found mostly in kent and dated to the first half of the seventh century however identifying these with any particular deity has not proven possible 122 a seated male figure appears on a cremation urn s lid discovered at spong hill in norfolk which was interpreted as a possible depiction of woden on a throne 123 also found on many crematory urns are a variety of symbols of these the swastikas have sometimes been interpreted as symbols associated with thunor 124 wights edit many anglo-saxonists have also assumed that anglo-saxon paganism was animistic in basis believing in a landscape populated by different spirits and other non-human entities such as elfs dwarfs and dragons 44 the english literature scholar richard north for instance described it as a natural religion based on animism 125 dunn suggested that for anglo-saxon pagans most everyday interactions would not have been with major deities but with such lesser supernatural beings 126 she also suggested that these entities might have exhibited similarities with later english beliefs in fairies 127 later anglo-saxon texts refer to beliefs in lfe elfs who are depicted as male but who exhibit gender-transgressing and effeminate traits these lfe may also have been a part of older pagan beliefs 126 various old english place names reference thrys giants and draca dragons 128 however such names did not necessarily emerge during the pagan period of early anglo-saxon england but could have developed at a later date 129 legend and poetry edit a 1908 depiction of beowulf fighting the dragon by j r skelton in pre-christian anglo-saxon england legends and other stories were transmitted orally instead of being written down it is for this reason that very few survive today 130 in both beowulf and deor s lament there are references to the mythological smith weyland and this figure also makes an appearance on the franks casket 131 there are moreover two place-names recorded in tenth century charters that include weyland s name 132 this entity s mythological stories are better fleshed out in norse stories 133 the only surviving anglo-saxon epic poem is the story of beowulf known only from a surviving manuscript that was written down by the christian monk sepa sometime between the eighth and eleventh centuries ad the story it tells is set not in england but in scandinavia and revolves around a geatish warrior named beowulf who travels to denmark to defeat a monster known as grendel who is terrorising the kingdom of hrothgar and later grendel s mother as well following this he later becomes the king of geatland before finally dying in battle with a dragon in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries it was commonly believed that beowulf was not an anglo-saxon pagan tale but a scandinavian christian one it was not until the influential critical essay beowulf the monsters and the critics by j r r tolkien delivered in 1936 that beowulf was established as a quintessentially english poem that while christian looked back on a living memory of paganism citation needed the poem refers to pagan practices such as cremation burials but also contains repeated mentions of the christian god and references to tales from biblical mythology such as that of cain and abel 134 given the restricted nature of literacy in anglo-saxon england it is likely that the author of the poem was a cleric or an associate of the clergy 135 nonetheless some academics still hold reservations about accepting it as containing information pertaining to anglo-saxon paganism with patrick wormald noting that vast reserves of intellectual energy have been devoted to threshing this poem for grains of authentic pagan belief but it must be admitted that the harvest has been meagre the poet may have known that his heroes were pagans but he did not know much about paganism 136 similarly christine fell declared that when it came to paganism the poet who authored beowulf had little more than a vague awareness of what was done in those days 137 conversely north argued that the poet knew more about paganism that he revealed in the poem suggesting that this could be seen in some of the language and references 138 cultic practice edit as archaeologist sarah semple noted the rituals of the early anglo-saxons involved the full pre-christian repertoire votive deposits furnished burial monumental mounds sacred natural phenomenon and eventually constructed pillars shrines and temples thereby having many commonalities with other pre-christian religions in europe 139 places of worship edit place-name evidence edit the neolithic long barrow of wayland s smithy may have had cultic symbolism for the pre-christian anglo-saxons place-name evidence may indicate some locations which were used as places of worship by the pre-christian anglo-saxons 140 however no unambiguous archaeological evidence currently supports the interpretation of these sites as places of cultic practice 140 two words that appear repeatedly in old english place names hearg and w oh have been interpreted as being references to cult spaces however it is likely that the two terms had distinctive meanings 141 these hearg locations were all found on high ground with wilson suggesting that these represented a communal place of worship for a specific group such as the tribe at a specific time of year 142 the archaeologist sarah semple also examined a number of such sites noting that while they all reflected activity throughout later prehistory and the romano-british period they had little evidence from the sixth and seventh centuries ce 143 she suggested that rather than referring to specifically anglo-saxon cultic sites hearg was instead used in reference to something british in tradition and usage 144 highlighting that while w oh sites vary in their location some being on high ground and others on low ground wilson noted that the majority were very close to ancient routeways 142 accordingly he suggested that the term w oh denoted a small wayside shrine accessible to the traveller 145 given that some w oh-sites were connected to the name of an individual wilson suggested that such individuals may have been the owner or guardian of the shrine 145 a number of place-names including reference to pre-christian deities compound these names with the old english word l ah wood or clearing in a wood and this may have attested to a sacred grove at which cultic practice took place 146 a number of other place-names associate the deity s name with a high point in the landscape such as d n or h h which might represent that such spots were considered particularly appropriate for cultic practice 147 in six examples the deity s name is associated with feld open land in which case these might have been sanctuaries located to specifically benefit the agricultural actions of the community 148 some old english place names make reference to an animal s head among them gateshead goat s head in tyne and wear and worms heath snake s head in surrey it is possible that some of these names had pagan religious origins perhaps referring to a sacrificed animal s head that was erected on a pole or a carved representation of one equally some or all of these place-names may have been descriptive metaphors for local landscape features 149 built structures edit the idol temples of that race the english should by no means be destroyed but only the idols in them take holy water and sprinkle it in these shrines build altars and place relics in them for if the shrines are well built it is essential that they should be changed from the worship of devils to the service of the true god when the people see that their shrines are not destroyed they will be able to banish error from their hearts and be more ready to come to the places they are familiar with but now recognizing and worshipping the true god pope gregory s letter to mellitus 150 no cultic building has survived from the early anglo-saxon period and nor do we have a contemporary illustration or even a clear description of such a structure 151 however there are four references to pre-christian cultic structures that appear in anglo-saxon literary sources 152 three of these can be found in bede s ecclesiastical history 152 one is a quotation from a letter written in 601 by pope gregory the great to the abbott mellitus in which he stated that christian missionaries need not destroy the temples of the idols but that they should be sprinkled with holy water and converted into churches 153 a second reference to cultic spaces found in bede appears in his discussion of coifi an influential english pagan priest for king edwin of northumbria who after converting to christianity cast a spear into the temple at goodmanham and then burned it to the ground 154 the third account was a reference to a temple in which king r dwald of east anglia kept an altar to both the christian god and another to demons 155 bede referred to these spaces using the latin term fanum he did not mention whether they were roofed or not although he chose to use fanum over the latin term templum which would more clearly describe a roofed temple building 2 however bede probably never saw a pagan cultic space first hand and was thus relying on literary sources for his understanding of what they looked like 152 summarising the archaeological evidence c j arnold concluded that the existence and nature of possible shrines remain intangible at present 156 the best known archaeological candidate for a building used in pre-christian cultic practice is building d2 at the yeavering complex in northumberland 157 inside the east door of the building was a pit filled with ox skulls which have been interpreted as sacrificial deposits 158 while two post-holes inside the building have been interpreted as evidence for holding statues of the deities and the building also showed no evidence of domestic usage suggesting some special function 159 blair suggested that the development of temple buildings in the late sixth and seventh centuries reflects the assimilation of christian ideas 160 bede s evidence and archaeology show that sanctuaries associated with royal estates at the end of the pagan period are likely to have been enclosures containing buildings of organic materials with images of the gods inside earlier in the countryside the sanctuaries were probably open air sites on hills or in forest groves with some kind of central feature ceremonies which took place at these sites included at least one annually probably around november which involved a large sacrifice of cattle audrey meaney 1995 161 other possible temples or shrine buildings have been identified by archaeological investigation as existing within such anglo-saxon cemeteries as lyminge in kent and bishopstone in sussex 162 although pope gregory referred to the conversion of pagan cult spaces into churches no archaeological investigation has yet found any firm evidence of churches being built on top of earlier pagan temples in england 163 it may be that gregory s advice was never taken by the anglo-saxon christians 159 although it is possible that the construction of crypts and the rebuilding of churches have destroyed earlier pagan foundations 164 blair highlighted evidence for the existence of square enclosures dating from the early anglo-saxon period which often included standing posts and which were often superimposed on earlier prehistoric monuments most notably bronze age barrows 165 he argued that these were cultic spaces and that rather than being based on a tradition from continental europe they were based on a tradition of square enclosure building that dated back to the pre-roman iron age in britain thus reflecting the adoption of indigenous british ideas into early anglo-saxon cult 166 building on blair s argument the archaeologist sarah semple suggested that in early anglo-saxon england such barrows might have been understood as the home of spirits ancestors or gods and accordingly used as cultic places 167 according to semple ancient remains in the landscape held a significant place in the anglo-saxon mind as part of a wider numinous spiritual and resonant landscape 168 blair suggested that the scant archaeological evidence for built cultic structures may be because many cultic spaces in early anglo-saxon england did not involve buildings 169 supporting this he highlighted ethnographically recorded examples from elsewhere in northern europe such as among the mansi in which shrines are located away from the main area of settlement and are demarcated by logs ropes fabrics and images none of which would leave an archaeological trace 170 arnold suggested that it may be mistaken to assume that the pre-christian anglo-saxons carried out ritual activity at specific sites instead suggesting that such practices occurred within the domestic area 171 as evidence he pointed to certain deposits that have been excavated in anglo-saxon settlements such as the deposition of an adult cow above a pit of clay and cobbles which had been placed at cowdery s down 171 the deposition of human and animal bone in settlement sites has parallels both with continental practices and with iron age and romano-british practices in britain 172 cultic trees and megaliths edit let us raise a hymn especially because he who thrust into tartarus of terrible torture the ghastly three-tongued serpent who vomits torrents of rank and virulent poisons through the ages deigned in like measure to send to earth the offspring begotten of holy parturition and because where once the crude pillars of the same foul snake and the stag were worshipped with coarse stupidity in profane shrines in their place dwelling for students not to mention holy houses of prayer are constructed skilfully by the talents of the architect aldhelm s letter to heahfrith 680s 173 although there are virtually no references to pre-christian sacred trees in old english literature 150 there are condemnations of tree veneration as well as the veneration of stones and wells in several later anglo-saxon penitentials 174 in the 680s the christian writer aldhelm referred to the pagan use of pillars associated with the foul snake and stag praising the fact that many had been converted into sites for christian worship 175 aldhelm had used the latin terms ermula cruda crude pillars although it was unclear what exactly he was referring to possibly examples include something akin to a wooden totem pole or a re-used neolithic menhir 173 meaney suggested that aldhelm s reference to the snake and stag might be describing a representation of an animal s head atop a pole in which case it would be related to the animal-head place-names 176 north also believed that this snake and stag were animals with pagan religious associations 177 it remains difficult to determine the location of any pre-christian holy trees 178 however there are cases where sacred trees and groves may be referenced in place-names 179 blair suggested that the use of the old english word b am tree in anglo-saxon place-names may be a reference to a special tree 180 he also suggested that the place-names containing stapol post or pillar might have represented trees that had been venerated when alive and which were transformed into carved pillars after their death 181 for instance both thurstable hundred in essex and thurstaple in kent appear to have derived from the old english unres-stapol meaning pillar of unor 182 archaeologically a large post was discovered at yeavering which has been interpreted as having a religious function 183 the purpose of such poles remains debatable however some might have represented grave markers others might have signalised group or kin identities or marked territory assembly places or sacred spaces 184 such wooden pillars would have been easy to convert into large crucifixes following the conversion to christianity and thus a number of these sacred sites may have survived as cultic spaces within a christian context 185 it has also been suggested that the vinescroll patterns that decorated a number of late anglo-saxon stone crosses such as the ruthwell cross may have been a form of inculturation harking back to pre-christian tree veneration 186 as bintley commented the impact of pre-christian beliefs about sacred trees on anglo-saxon christian beliefs should be interpreted not as pagan survivals but as a fully integrated aspect of early english christianity 187 sacrifice edit christian sources regularly complained that the pagans of anglo-saxon england practiced animal sacrifice 188 in the seventh century the first laws against pagan sacrifices appeared while in the paenitentiale theodori one to ten years penance was allotted for making sacrifices or for eating sacrificed meat 176 archaeological evidence reveals that meat was often used as a funerary offering and in many cases whole animal carcasses were placed in burials 188 commenting on this archaeological evidence pluskowski expressed the view that this reflected a regular and well-established practice in early anglo-saxon society 188 it appears that they emphasised the killing of oxen over other species as suggested by both written and archaeological evidence 189 the old english martyrology records that november old english bl tm na the month of sacrifice was particularly associated with sacrificial practices the original old english se m na is nemned novembris on l den and on re ge e de bl tm na for on re yldran h h ene w ron on am m n e h ble ton t is t h bet hton and ben mdon hyra de folgyldum a ne t a e h woldon syllan modern english translation the month is called novembris in latin and in our language bloodmonth because our elders when they had been heathens always in this month sacrificed that is that they took and devoted to their idols the cattle which they wished to offer 190 there are several cases where animal remains were buried in what appears to be ritualistic conditions for instance at frilford berkshire a pig or boar s head was buried with six flat stones and two roman-era tiles then placed on top while at an anglo-saxon cemetery in soham cambridgeshire an ox s head was buried with the muzzle facing down archaeologist david wilson stated that these may be evidence of sacrifices to a pagan god 191 the folklorist jacqueline simpson has suggested that some english folk customs recorded in the late medieval and early modern periods involving the display of a decapitated animal s head on a pole may derive their origins from pre-christian sacrificial practices 192 unlike some other areas of germanic europe there is no written evidence for human sacrifice being practiced in anglo-saxon england 193 dunn suggested that had christian writers believed that such practices were being carried out then they would have strongly condemned them 194 nevertheless the historian hilda ellis davidson expressed the view that undoubtedly human sacrifice must have been known to the anglo-saxons even if it played no great part in their lives 195 she suggested that those who were used as victims included slaves criminals or prisoners of war and that such sacrifices were only resorted to in times of crisis such as plagues famine or attack 195 there has however been speculation that 23 of the corpses at the sutton hoo burial site were sacrificial victims clustered around a sacred tree from which they had been hanged 196 alongside this some have suggested that the corpse of an anglo-saxon woman found at sewerby on the yorkshire wolds suggested that she had been buried alive alongside a nobleman possibly as a sacrifice or to accompany him to the afterlife 197 weapons among them spears swords seaxes and shield fittings have been found from english rivers such as the river thames although no large-scale weapon deposits have been discovered that are akin to those found elsewhere in europe 198 priests and kings edit wilson stated that virtually nothing was known of the pre-christian priesthood in anglo-saxon england 199 although there are two references to anglo-saxon pagan priests in the surviving textual sources 200 one is that provided by bede which refers to coifi of northumbria 200 north has backed chaney s view that kings mediated between the gods and the people on the basis of a lack of any obvious priesthood 201 one of the inhumation burials excavated at yeavering classified as grave ax has been interpreted as being that of a pre-christian priest although the body was not able to be sexed or aged by osteoarchaeologists it was found with a goat s skull buried by its feet and a long wooden staff with metal fittings beside it 202 there have also been suggestions that individuals who were biologically male but who were buried in female costume may have represented a form of magico-religious specialists in anglo-saxon england 203 it has been suggested that these individuals were analogous to the sei menn recorded in old norse sources 204 this possibility is linked to an account provided by tacitus in his germania in which he refers to a male pagan priest who wore female clothing 205 campbell suggested that it might have been priestly authorities who organised the imposition of physical penalties in early anglo-saxon england with secular authorities only taking on this role during the conversion to christianity 206 the concept of sacral kingship no longer has much credibility within scholarship 207 germanic pagan society was structured hierarchically under a tribal chieftain or cyning king who at the same time acted as military leader high judge and high priest the tribe was bound together by a code of customary proper behaviour or sidu regulating the contracts and conflicts between the individual families or sibbs within the tribe the aristocratic society arrayed below the king included the ranks of ealdorman thegn heah-gerefa and gerefa 208 offices at the court included that of the thyle and the scop the title of hlaford lord denoted the head of any household in origin and expressed the relation to allegiance between a follower and his leader early anglo-saxon warfare had many aspects of endemic warfare typical of tribal warrior societies it was based on retainers bound by oath to fight for their lords who in turn were obliged to show generosity to their followers 209 the pagan anglo-saxons inherited the common germanic institution of sacral kingship a king cyning was elected from among eligible members of a royal family or cynn by the witena gem t an assembly of an elite that replaced the earlier folkmoot which was the equivalent of the germanic thing the assembly of all free men the person elected was usually the son of the last king tribal kingship came to an end in the 9th century with the hegemony of wessex culminating in a unified kingdom of england by the 10th century the cult of kingship was central to pagan anglo-saxon society the king was equivalent to the position of high priest by his divine descent he represented or indeed was the luck of the people 210 the central importance of the institution of kingship is illustrated by the twenty-six synonyms for king employed by the beowulf poet 211 the title of bretwalda appears to have conveyed the status of some sort of formal or ceremonial overlordship over britain but it is uncertain whether it predates the 9th century and if it does what if any prerogatives it carried patrick wormald interprets it as less an objectively realised office than a subjectively perceived status and emphasises the partiality of its usage in favour of southumbrian kings 212 funerary rites edit funerary urn from the snape anglo-saxon cemetery cemeteries are the most widely excavated aspect of anglo-saxon archaeology and thus much information about the funerary aspects of anglo-saxon pagan religion has been obtained 38 one of the aspects of anglo-saxon paganism that we know most about is their burial customs which we have discovered from archaeological excavations at various sites including sutton hoo spong hill prittlewell snape and walkington wold and we today know of the existence of around 1200 anglo-saxon pagan cemeteries there was no set form of burial among the pagan anglo-saxons with cremation being preferred among the angles in the north and burial among the saxons in the south although both forms were found throughout england sometimes in the same cemeteries when cremation did take place the ashes were usually placed within an urn and then buried sometimes along with grave goods 197 according to archaeologist dave wilson the usual orientation for an inhumation in a pagan anglo-saxon cemetery was west-east with the head to the west although there were often deviations from this 213 indicating a possible religious belief grave goods were common among inhumation burials as well as cremations free anglo-saxon men were buried with at least one weapon in the pagan tradition often a seax but sometimes also with a spear sword or shield or a combination of these 197 there are also a number of recorded cases of parts of non-human animals being buried within such graves most common among these was body parts belonging to either goats or sheep although parts of oxen were also relatively common and there are also isolated cases of goose crab apples duck eggs and hazelnuts being buried in graves it is widely thought therefore that such items constituted a food source for the deceased 214 in some cases animal skulls particularly oxen but also pig were buried in human graves a practice that was also found in earlier roman britain 197 certain anglo-saxon burials appeared to have ritualistic elements to them implying that a religious rite was performed over them during the funeral while there are many multiple burials where more than one corpse was found in a single grave that date from the anglo-saxon period there is a small group of such burials where an interpretation involving ritual practices may be possible for instance at welbeck hill in lincolnshire the corpse of a decapitated woman was placed in reverse on top of the body of an old man while in a number of other similar examples female bodies were again placed above those of men this has led some archaeologists to suspect a form of suttee where the female was the spouse of the male and was killed to accompany him upon death other theories hold that the females were slaves who were viewed as the property of the men and who were again killed to accompany their master 215 similarly four anglo-saxon burials have been excavated where it appears that the individual was buried while still alive which could imply that this was a part of either a religious rite or as a form of punishment 216 there are also many cases where corpses have been found decapitated for instance at a mass grave in thetford norfolk fifty beheaded individuals were discovered their heads possibly having been taken as trophies of war in other cases of decapitation it seems possible that it was evidence of religious ritual presumably human sacrifice or execution 217 218 one of the burial mounds at sutton hoo archaeological investigation has displayed that structures or buildings were built inside a number of pagan cemeteries and as david wilson noted the evidence then from cemetery excavations is suggestive of small structures and features some of which may perhaps be interpreted as shrines or sacred areas 219 in some cases there is evidence of far smaller structures being built around or alongside individual graves implying possible small shrines to the dead individual or individuals buried there 220 eventually in the sixth and seventh centuries the idea of burial mounds began to appear in anglo-saxon england and in certain cases earlier burial mounds from the neolithic bronze age iron age and romano-british periods were simply reused by the anglo-saxons it is not known why they adopted this practice but it may be from the practices of the native britons 221 burial mounds remained objects of veneration in early anglo-saxon christianity and numerous churches were built next to tumuli another form of burial was that of ship burials which were practiced by many of the germanic peoples across northern europe in many cases it seems that the corpse was placed in a ship that was either sent out to sea or left on land but in both cases burned in suffolk however ships were not burned but buried as is the case at sutton hoo which it is believed was the resting place of the king of the east angles raedwald 221 both ship and tumulus burials were described in the beowulf poem through the funerals of scyld scefing and beowulf respectively it has been considered largely impossible to distinguish a pagan grave from a christian one in the anglo-saxon context after the latter had spread throughout england 222 festivals edit these few remarks by bede show us a people who of necessity fitted closely into the pattern of the changing year who were of the earth and what grows in it who breathed the farmy exhalations of cattle and sheep who marked the passage of time according to the life-cycle of their stock and the growth of their plants or by the appropriate period for offerings to the gods historian brian branston 1957 223 everything that we know about the religious festivals of the pagan anglo-saxons comes from a book written by bede titled de temporum ratione the reckoning of time in which he described the calendar of the year 224 225 however its purpose was not to describe the pagan sacred year 226 and little information within it can be corroborated from other sources 227 bede provided explanations for the names of the various pre-christian festivals that he described however these etymologies are questionable it is unknown if these etymologies were based on his pre-existing knowledge or whether they represented his own theories 228 casting further doubt over some of his festival etymologies is the fact that some of the place-name etymologies that bede provides in his writings are demonstrably wrong 228 the pagan anglo-saxons followed a calendar with twelve lunar months with the occasional year having thirteen months so that the lunar and solar alignment could be corrected bede claimed that the greatest pagan festival was modraniht meaning mothers night which was situated at the winter solstice which marked the start of the anglo-saxon year 229 86 following this festival in the month of solmona february bede claims that the pagans offered cakes to their deities 230 231 then in eostur-monath aprilis april a spring festival was celebrated dedicated to the goddess eostre 232 86 and the later christian festival of easter took its name from this month and its goddess the month of september was known as halegmonath meaning holy month which may indicate that it had special religious significance 233 86 the month of november was known as blod-monath meaning blood month and was commemorated with animal sacrifice both in offering to the gods and probably also to gather a source of food to be stored over the winter 86 234 remarking on bede s account of the anglo-saxon year the historian brian branston noted that they show us a people who of necessity fitted closely into the pattern of the changing year who were of the earth and what grows in it and that they were in fact a people who were in a symbiotic relationship with mother earth and father sky 223 stenton thought that bede s account reveals that there was a strong element of heathen festivity at the heart of the early anglo-saxon calendar 235 the historian james campbell described this as a complicated calendar and expressed the view that it would have required an organised and recognised priesthood to plan the observation of it 200 symbolism edit various recurring symbols appear on certain pagan anglo-saxon artefacts in particular on grave goods most notable among these was the swastika which was widely inscribed on crematory urns and also on various brooches and other forms of jewellery as well as on certain pieces of ceremonial weaponry the archaeologist david wilson remarked that this undoubtedly had special importance for the anglo-saxons either magical or religious or both it seems very likely that it was the symbol of the thunder god thunor and when found on weapons or military gear its purpose would be to provide protection and success in battle he also noted however that its widespread usage might have led to it becoming a purely decorative device with no real symbolic importance 236 another symbol that has appeared on several pagan artefacts from this period including a number of swords was the rune which represented the letter t and may be associated with the god tiw 237 in the later sixth and seventh centuries a trend emerged in anglo-saxon england entailing the symbolism of a horn-helmeted man 238 the archaeologist tim pestell stated that these represented one of the clearest examples of objects with primarily cultic or religious connotations 238 this iconography is not unique to england and can be found in scandinavia and continental germanic europe too 239 the inclusion of this image on helmets and pendants suggests that it may have had apotropaic or amuletic associations 240 this figure has often been interpreted as a depiction of woden although there is no firm evidence to support this conclusion 241 shamanism magic and witchcraft edit in 2011 pluskowski noted that the term shamanism was increasingly being used by scholars of anglo-saxon paganism 242 glosecki argued that evidence for shamanic beliefs were visible in later anglo-saxon literature 243 williams also argued that paganism had had a shamanic component through his analysis of early funerary rites 55 summarising this evidence blair noted that it was hard to doubt that something like shamanism lies ultimately in the background of early anglo-saxon religion 244 he nevertheless highlighted problems with the use of shamanism in this context noting that any such anglo-saxon practices would have been different from the shamanism of siberia 244 conversely no l adams expressed the view that at present there is no clear evidence of shamanistic beliefs in anglo-saxon england 245 anglo-saxon pagans believed in magic and witchcraft there are various old english terms for witch including h gtesse witch fury whence modern english hag wicca gealdricge scinl ce and hellr ne the belief in witchcraft was suppressed in the 9th to 10th century as is evident e g from the laws of lfred ca 890 citation needed it is possible that the anglo-saxons drew no distinction between magic and ritual in the same manner as modern western society does 37 the christian authorities attempted to stamp out a belief and practice in witchcraft with the paenitentiale theodori attributed to theodore of tarsus condemning those that consult divinations and use them in the pagan manner or that permit people of that kind into their houses to seek some knowledge 246 similarly the u version of the paenitentiale theodori condemns those who observe auguries omens or dreams or any other prophecies after the manner of the pagans 246 the word wiccan witches is associated with animistic healing rites in the paenitentiale halitgari where it is stated that some men are so blind that they bring their offering to earth-fast stone and also to trees and to wellsprings as the witches teach and are unwilling to understand how stupidly they do or how that dead stone or that dumb tree might help them or give forth health when they themselves are never able to stir from their place the phrase swa wiccan t ca as the witches teach seems to be an addition to halitgar s original added by an eleventh-century old english translator 247 the pagan anglo-saxons also appeared to wear amulets and there are many cases where corpses were buried with them as david wilson noted to the early anglo- saxons they were part and parcel of the supernatural that made up their world of belief although occupying the shadowy dividing area between superstition and religion if indeed such a division actually existed 248 one of the most notable amulets found in anglo-saxon graves is the cowrie shell which has been often interpreted by modern academics as having been a fertility symbol due to its physical resemblance to the vagina and the fact that it was most commonly found in female graves not being native to british seas the cowrie shells had to have been brought to england by traders who had come all the way from the red sea in the middle east 249 animal teeth were also used as amulets by the pagan anglo-saxons and many examples have been found that had formerly belonged to boar beaver and in some cases even humans 250 other amulets included items such as amethyst and amber beads pieces of quartz or iron pyrite worked and unworked flint pre-anglo-saxon coinage and fossils and from their distribution in graves it has been stated that in anglo-saxon pagan society amulets were very much more the preserve of women than men 251 reception and legacy edit days of the week edit four of the modern english days of the week derive their names from these anglo-saxon deities 252 these names have their origins in the latin system of week-day names which had been translated into old english 253 the anglo-saxons like other germanic peoples adapted the week-day names introduced by their interaction with the roman empire but glossed their indigenous gods over the roman deities with the exception of saturday in a process known as interpretatio germanica modern english day name old english day name english day name meaning glossed from latin day name latin day name meaning monday m nand g moon s day personified in

of its time regarded the english as adherents of two consecutive religions paganism governed the settlers of the 4th-6th century but was superseded in the 7th-10th century by christianity of the two christianity a religion of the book documented itself thoroughly while in failing to do so paganism laid itself open to centuries of abuse conjecture or mindless admiration archaeologists martin carver alex sanmark and sarah semple 2010 8 while historical investigation into germanic paganism and its mythology began in the seventeenth century with peder resen s edda islandorum 1665 this largely focused only upon norse mythology much of which was preserved in old icelandic sources in the eighteenth century english romanticism developed a strong enthusiasm for iceland and nordic culture expressed in original english poems extolling viking virtues such as thomas warton s runic odes of 1748 in the nineteenth century this developed into two movements within the british educated elite one of which was composed of scandophiles and the other of germanophiles who associated the english with either the scandinavians or the germans respectively 254 with nascent nationalism in early nineteenth-century europe by the 1830s both nordic and german philology had produced national mythologies in n f s grundtvig s nordens mytologi and jacob grimm s deutsche mythologie respectively british romanticism at the same time had at its disposal both a celtic and a viking revival but nothing focusing on the anglo-saxons because there was very little evidence of their pagan mythology still surviving indeed so scant was evidence of paganism in anglo-saxon england that some scholars came to assume that the anglo-saxons had been christianised essentially from the moment of their arrival in britain 255 the study of anglo-saxon paganism began only in the mid nineteenth century when john kemble published the saxons in england volume i 1849 in which he discussed the usefulness of examining place-names to find out about the religion 256 this was followed by the publication of john yonge akerman s remains of pagan saxondom 1855 akerman defended his chosen subject in the introduction by pointing out the archaeological evidence of a pagan saxon mode of sepulture on english soil lasting from the middle of the fifth to the middle or perhaps the end of the seventh century 257 from this point onward more academic research into the anglo-saxons pagan religion appeared this led to further books on the subject such as those primarily about the anglo-saxon gods such as brian branston s the lost gods of england 1957 and kathy herbert s looking for the lost gods of england 1994 others emphasised archaeological evidence such as david wilson s anglo-saxon paganism 1992 and the edited anthology signals of belief in early england anglo-saxon paganism revisited 2010 modern paganism edit the deities of pre-christian anglo-saxon religion have been adopted by practitioners of various forms of modern paganism specifically those belonging to the new religious movement of heathenry 258 the anglo-saxon gods have also been adopted in forms of the modern pagan religion of wicca particularly the denomination of seax-wicca founded by raymond buckland in the 1970s which combined anglo-saxon deity names with the wiccan theological structure 258 such belief
