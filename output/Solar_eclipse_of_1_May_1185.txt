prophet jeremiah on wednesday during the evening service there was a sign in the sun it became very dark even the stars could be seen it seemed to men as if everything were green and the sun became like a crescent of the moon from the horns of which a glow similar to that of red-hot charcoals was emanating it was terrible to see this sign of the lord 22 23 the melrose chronicle claims that stars
