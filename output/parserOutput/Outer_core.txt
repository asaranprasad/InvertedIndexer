outer core - wikipedia outer core from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the internal structure of earth the outer core of the earth is a fluid layer about 2,400 km 1,500 mi 1 thick and composed of mostly iron and nickel that lies above earth s solid inner core and below its mantle its outer boundary lies 2,890 km 1,800 mi beneath earth s surface the transition between the inner core and outer core is located approximately 5,150 km 3,200 mi beneath the earth s surface unlike the inner core the outer core is liquid the inner core is also referred to as the solid core 2 contents 1 properties 2 see also 3 references 4 external links properties edit seismic inversions of body waves and normal modes constrain the radius of the outer core to be 3483 km with an uncertainty of 5 km while that of the inner core is 1220 10 km 3 94 estimates for the temperature of the outer core are about 3,000 4,500 k 2,730 4,230 c 4,940 7,640 f in its outer regions and 4,000 8,000 k 3,730 7,730 c 6,740 13,940 f near the inner core 4 evidence for a fluid outer core includes from seismology which shows that seismic shear-waves are not transmitted through the outer core 5 because of its high temperature modeling work has shown that the outer core is a low viscosity fluid that convects turbulently 4 eddy currents in the nickel iron fluid of the outer core are believed to influence the earth s magnetic field the average magnetic field strength in the earth s outer core was measured to be 2.5 millitesla 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface 6 7 the outer core is not under enough pressure to be solid so it is liquid even though it has a composition similar to the inner core sulfur and oxygen could be present in the outer core 8 as heat is transferred outward toward the mantle the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid region to freeze causing the solid inner core to grow this growth rate is estimated to be 1 mm per year 9 see also edit structure of the earth references edit https www nationalgeographic com science earth surface-of-the-earth earths-interior beno gutenberg 4 june 2016 physics of the earth s interior elsevier pp 115 isbn 978-1-4832-8212-1 ahrens thomas j ed 1995 global earth physics a handbook of physical constants 3rd ed washington dc american geophysical union isbn 9780875908519 a b de wijs gilles a kresse georg vo adlo lidunka dobson david alf dario gillan michael j price geoffrey d 1998 pdf nature 392 6678 805 bibcode doi jeffreys harold 1926-06-01 monthly notices of the royal astronomical society 1 371 383 bibcode doi issn science20 com retrieved on 2012-01-27 buffett bruce a 2010 tidal dissipation and the strength of the earth s internal magnetic field nature 468 7326 952 4 bibcode doi pmid gubbins david sreenivasan binod mound jon rost sebastian may 19 2011 melting of the earth s inner core nature 473 7347 361 363 bibcode doi pmid waszek lauren irving jessica deuss arwen 2011 reconciling the hemispherical structure of earth s inner core with its super-rotation nature geoscience 4 264 267 bibcode doi external links edit the wikibook historical geology has a page on the topic of structure of the earth retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title outer core oldid 828915490 categories structure of the earth geomagnetism navigation menu search this page was last edited on 5 march 2018 at 15 01 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
