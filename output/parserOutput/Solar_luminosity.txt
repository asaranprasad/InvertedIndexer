solar luminosity - wikipedia solar luminosity from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search evolution of the solar luminosity radius and effective temperature compared to the present-day sun after ribas 2010 1 the solar luminosity l is a unit of radiant flux power emitted in the form of photons conventionally used by astronomers to measure the luminosity of stars it is defined in terms of the sun s output one solar luminosity is 7026382800000000000 3.828 1026 w 2 this does not include the solar neutrino luminosity which would add 0.023 l 3 the sun is a weakly variable star and its luminosity therefore fluctuates 4 the major fluctuation is the eleven-year solar cycle sunspot cycle that causes a periodic variation of about 0.1 other variations over the last 200 300 years are thought to be much smaller than this 5 contents 1 determination 2 see also 3 references 4 further reading 5 external links determination edit solar luminosity is related to solar irradiance the solar constant solar irradiance is responsible for the orbital forcing that causes the milankovitch cycles which determine earthly glacial cycles the mean irradiance at the top of the earth s atmosphere is sometimes known as the solar constant i irradiance is defined as power per unit area so the solar luminosity total power emitted by the sun is the irradiance received at the earth solar constant multiplied by the area of the sphere whose radius is the mean distance between the earth and the sun l 4 k i a 2 displaystyle l odot 4 pi ki odot a 2 where a is the unit distance the value of the astronomical unit in metres and k is a constant whose value is very close to one that reflects the fact that the mean distance from the earth to the sun is not exactly one astronomical unit see also edit sun solar mass solar radius nuclear fusion triple-alpha process references edit ribas ignasi february 2010 the sun and stars as the primary energy input in planetary atmospheres solar and stellar variability impact on earth and planets proceedings of the international astronomical union iau symposium 264 pp 3 18 arxiv bibcode doi williams david r 1 july 2013 national aeronautics and space administration retrieved 13 april 2014 bahcall john n 1989 neutrino astrophysics cambridge university press p 79 isbn 978-0-521-37975-5 vieira l e a norton a dudok de wit t kretzschmar m schmidt g a cheung m c m 2012 how the inclination of earth s orbit affects incoming solar irradiance geophysical research letters 39 16 n a bibcode doi noerdlinger peter d 2008 solar mass loss the astronomical unit and the scale of the solar system celestial mechanics and dynamical astronomy 801 3807 arxiv bibcode further reading edit sackmann i -j boothroyd a i 2003 our sun v a bright young sun consistent with helioseismology and warm temperatures on ancient earth and mars astrophys j 583 2 1024 39 arxiv bibcode doi foukal p fr hlich c spruit h wigley t m l 2006 nature 443 7108 161 66 bibcode doi pmid pelletier jon d 1996 astrophys j 463 1 l41 l45 arxiv bibcode doi stoykova d a shopov y y ford d georgiev l n et al 1999 powerful millennial-scale solar luminosity cycles and their influence over past climates and geomagnetic field external links edit retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title solar luminosity oldid 821651020 categories sun stellar astronomy units of power units of measurement in astronomy navigation menu search this page was last edited on 21 january 2018 at 20 15 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
