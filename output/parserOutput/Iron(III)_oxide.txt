ii oxide iron ii iii oxide except where otherwise noted data are given for materials in their standard state at 25 c 77 f 100 kpa n what is yn infobox references iron iii oxide or ferric oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula fe2o3 it is one of the three main oxides of iron the other two being iron ii oxide feo which is rare and iron ii iii oxide fe3o4 which also occurs naturally as the mineral magnetite as the mineral known as hematite fe2o3 is the main source of iron for the steel industry fe2o3 is ferromagnetic citation needed dark red and readily attacked by acids iron iii oxide is often called rust and is acidic in nature and to some extent this label is useful because rust shares several properties and has a similar composition to a chemist rust is considered an ill-defined material described as hydrated ferric oxide citation needed contents 1 structure 1.1 alpha phase 1.2 gamma phase 1.3 other phases 2 hydrated iron iii oxides 3 reactions 4 preparation 5 uses 5.1 iron industry 5.2 polishing 5.3 pigment 5.4 magnetic recording 5.5 photocatalysis 5.6 medicine 6 see also 7 references 8 external links structure edit fe2o3 can be obtained in various polymorphs in the main ones and iron adopts octahedral coordination geometry that is each fe center is bound to six oxygen ligands alpha phase edit -fe2o3 has the rhombohedral corundum -al2o3 structure and is the most common form it occurs naturally as the mineral hematite which is mined as the main ore of iron it is antiferromagnetic below 260 k morin transition temperature and exhibits weak ferromagnetism between 260 k and the n el temperature 950 k 8 it is easy to prepare using both thermal decomposition and precipitation in the liquid phase its magnetic properties are dependent on many factors e g pressure particle size and magnetic field intensity gamma phase edit -fe2o3 has a cubic structure it is metastable and converted from the alpha phase at high temperatures it occurs naturally as the mineral maghemite it is ferromagnetic and finds application in recording tapes 9 although ultrafine particles smaller than 10 nanometers are superparamagnetic it can be prepared by thermal dehydratation of gamma iron iii oxide-hydroxide another method involves the careful oxidation of iron ii iii oxide fe3o4 9 the ultrafine particles can be prepared by thermal decomposition of iron iii oxalate other phases edit several other phases have been identified or claimed the -phase is cubic body-centered space group ia3 metastable and at temperatures above 500 c 930 f converts to alpha phase it can be prepared by reduction of hematite by carbon pyrolysis of iron iii chloride solution or thermal decomposition of iron iii sulfate the epsilon phase is rhombic and shows properties intermediate between alpha and gamma and may have useful magnetic properties preparation of the pure epsilon phase has proven very challenging due to contamination with alpha and gamma phases material with a high proportion of epsilon phase can be prepared by thermal transformation of the gamma phase this phase is also metastable transforming to the alpha phase at between 500 and 750 c 930 and 1,380 f can also be prepared by oxidation of iron in an electric arc or by sol-gel precipitation from iron iii nitrate citation needed additionally at high pressure an amorphous form is claimed 5 recent research has revealed epsilon iron iii oxide in ancient chinese jian ceramic glazes which may provide insight into ways to produce that form in the lab 10 hydrated iron iii oxides edit several hydrates of iron iii oxide exists when alkali is added to solutions of soluble fe iii salts a red-brown gelatinous precipitate forms this is not fe oh 3 but fe2o3 h2o also written as fe o oh several forms of the hydrated oxide of fe iii exist as well the red lepidocrocite -fe o oh occurs on the outside of rusticles and the orange goethite which occurs internally in rusticles when fe2o3 h2o is heated it loses its water of hydration further heating at 1670 k converts fe2o3 to black fe3o4 feiifeiii2o4 which is known as the mineral magnetite fe o oh is soluble in acids giving fe oh2 6 3 in concentrated aqueous alkali fe2o3 gives fe oh 6 3 9 reactions edit the most important reaction is its carbothermal reduction which gives iron used in steel-making fe 2o 3 3 co 2 fe 3 co 2 another redox reaction is the extremely exothermic thermite reaction with aluminium 11 2 al fe 2o 3 2 fe al2o3 this process is used to weld thick metals such as rails of train tracks by using a ceramic container to funnel the molten iron in between two sections of rail thermite is also used in weapons and making small-scale cast-iron sculptures and tools partial reduction with hydrogen at about 400 c produces magnetite a black magnetic material that contains both fe iii and fe ii 12 3 fe 2o 3 h 2 2 fe 3o 4 h 2o iron iii oxide is insoluble in water but dissolves readily in strong acid e g hydrochloric and sulfuric acids it also dissolves well in solutions of chelating agents such as edta and oxalic acid heating iron iii oxides with other metal oxides or carbonates yields materials known as ferrates 12 zno fe 2o 3 zn feo 2 2 preparation edit iron iii oxide is a product of the oxidation of iron it can be prepared in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate an inert electrolyte with an iron anode 4 fe 3 o 2 2 h 2o 4 feo oh the resulting hydrated iron iii oxide written here as fe o oh dehydrates around 200 c 12 13 2 feo oh fe 2o 3 h 2o uses edit iron industry edit the overwhelming application of iron iii oxide is as the feedstock of the steel and iron industries e g the production of iron steel and many alloys 13 polishing edit a very fine powder of ferric oxide is known as jeweler s rouge red rouge or simply rouge it is used to put the final polish on metallic jewelry and lenses and historically as a cosmetic rouge cuts more slowly than some modern polishes such as cerium iv oxide but is still used in optics fabrication and by jewelers for the superior finish it can produce when polishing gold the rouge slightly stains the gold which contributes to the appearance of the finished piece rouge is sold as a powder paste laced on polishing cloths or solid bar with a wax or grease binder other polishing compounds are also often called rouge even when they do not contain iron oxide jewelers remove the residual rouge on jewelry by use of ultrasonic cleaning products sold as stropping compound are often applied to a leather strop to assist in getting a razor edge on knives straight razors or any other edged tool pigment edit two different colors at different hydrate phase red yellow of iron iii oxide hydrate 3 they are useful as pigments iron iii oxide is also used as a pigment under names pigment brown 6 pigment brown 7 and pigment red 101 14 some of them e g pigment red 101 and pigment brown 6 are approved by the us food and drug administration fda for use in cosmetics iron oxides are used as pigments in dental composites alongside titanium oxides 15 hematite is the characteristic component of the swedish paint color falu red magnetic recording edit iron iii oxide was the most common magnetic particle used in all types of magnetic storage and recording media including magnetic disks for data storage and magnetic tape used in audio and video recording as well as data storage its use in computer disks was superseded by cobalt alloy enabling thinner magnetic films with higher storage density 16 photocatalysis edit because its acidic in nature 1.9-2.2 ev lies in an intense region of the solar spectrum -fe2o3 has been studied as a photoanode for solar water oxidation 17 however its efficacy is limited by a short diffusion length 2-4 nm of photo-excited charge carriers 18 and subsequent fast recombination requiring a large overpotential to drive the reaction 19 research has been focused on improving the water oxidation performance of fe2o3 using nanostructuring 17 surface functionalization 20 or by employing alternate crystal phases such as -fe2o3 21 medicine edit a mixture of zinc oxide with about 0.5 iron iii oxide is called calamine which is the active ingredient of calamine lotion see also edit iron oxides chalcanthum references edit a b c d pdf http www lesker com england kurt j lesker company ltd 2012-01-05 retrieved
