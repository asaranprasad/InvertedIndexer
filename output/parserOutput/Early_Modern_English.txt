abbreviated to emode 1 emne or eme is the stage of the english language used from the beginning of the tudor period until the english interregnum and restoration or from the transition from middle english in the late 15th century to the transition to modern english during the mid-to-late 17th century 2 prior to and following the accession of james i to the english throne in 1603 the emerging english standard began to influence the spoken and written middle scots of scotland the grammatical and orthographical conventions of the literary english language of the late 16th to 17th centuries have been very influential on modern standard english notably via the language of the king james bible and william shakespeare so that modern readers of english are generally able to understand texts written in the late phase of the early modern english period texts from the earlier phase from the late 15th century such as le morte d arthur 1485 to the mid-to-late 16th century such as gorboduc 1561 may present more difficulties but are still recognizably closer to modern english grammar lexicon and phonology than middle english texts of the 14th century contents 1 history 1.1 english

8 external links history edit english renaissance edit transition from middle english edit the change from middle english to early modern english was not just a matter of vocabulary or pronunciation changing it was the beginning of a new era in the history of english an era of linguistic change in a language with large variations in dialect was replaced by a new era of a more standardised language with a richer lexicon and an established and lasting literature 1476 william caxton starts printing in westminster however the language he uses reflects the variety of styles and dialects used by the authors who originally wrote the material tudor period 1485 1603 edit 1485 caxton publishes thomas malory s le morte d arthur the first print bestseller in english malory s language while archaic in some respects is clearly early modern possibly a yorkshire or midlands dialect 1491 or 1492 richard pynson starts printing in london his style tends to prefer chancery standard the form of english used by government henry viii edit c 1509 pynson becomes the king s official printer from 1525 publication of william tyndale s bible translation which was initially banned 1539 publication of the great bible the first officially authorised bible in english edited by myles coverdale largely from the work of tyndale this bible is read to congregations regularly in churches familiarising much of the population of england with a standard form of the language 1549 publication of the first book of common prayer in english under the supervision of thomas cranmer revised 1552 and 1662 this book standardises much of the wording of church services some have argued that since attendance at prayer book services was required by law for many years the repetitive use of the language of the prayer book helped to standardise modern english to a degree greater than even that of the king james bible 1611 3 1557 publication of tottel s miscellany elizabethan english edit title page of gorboduc printed 1565 the tragedie of gorbodvc whereof three actes were wrytten by thomas nortone and the two laste by thomas sackuyle sett forthe as the same was shewed before the qvenes most excellent maiestie in her highnes court of whitehall the xviii day of january anno domini .1561 by the gentlemen of thynner temple in london elizabethan era 1558 1603 1582 the rheims and douai bible is completed and the new testament is released in rheims france in 1582 it is the first complete english translation of the bible officially sponsored and carried out by the catholic church earlier translations into english especially of the psalms and gospels existed as far back as the 9th century but this was the first catholic english translation of the full bible though the old testament is complete at this time as well it won t be published until 1609 1610 when it s released in two volumes though not making a large impact on the english language at large it certainly played a role in the development of english especially in heavily catholic english speaking areas of the world christopher marlowe fl 1586 1593 1592 the spanish tragedy by thomas kyd c 1590 to c 1612 shakespeare s plays written 17th century edit jacobean and caroline eras edit jacobean era 1603 1625 edit 1609 shakespeare s sonnets published other playwrights ben jonson thomas dekker beaumont and fletcher francis beaumont and john fletcher john webster 1607 the first successful permanent english colony in the new world jamestown is established in virginia early vocabulary specific to american english loaned from indigenous languages such as moose racoon 1611 the king james bible is published largely based on tyndale s translation it remains the standard bible in the church of england for many years 1623 shakespeare s first folio published caroline era and english civil war 1625 1649 edit 1630 1651 william bradford governor of plymouth colony writes in his journal it will become of plymouth plantation one of the earliest texts written in the american colonies 1647 publication of the first beaumont and fletcher folio interregnum and restoration edit the period of the english civil war and the interregnum was one of social and political upheaval and instability the dates for restoration literature are a matter of convention and they differ markedly from genre to genre thus the restoration in drama may last until 1700 while in poetry it may last only until 1666 the annus mirabilis and in prose it might end in 1688 with the increasing tensions over succession and the corresponding rise in journalism and periodicals or not until 1700 when those periodicals grew more stabilised 1651 publication of leviathan by thomas hobbes 1660 1669 samuel pepys writes in his diary it will become an important eyewitness account of the restoration era 1662 new edition of the book of common prayer largely based on the 1549 and subsequent editions this also long remains a standard work in english 1667 publication of paradise lost by john milton and of annus mirabilis by john dryden development to modern english edit the 17th-century port towns and their forms of speech gained influence over the old county towns england experienced a new period of internal peace and relative stability encouraging the arts including literature from around the 1690s onwards modern english can be taken to have emerged fully by the beginning of the georgian era in 1714 although english orthography remained somewhat fluid until the publication of johnson s a dictionary of the english language in 1755 the towering importance of william shakespeare over the other elizabethan authors was the result of his reception during the 17th and 18th centuries directly contributing to the development of standard english as a consequence shakespeare s plays are familiar and comprehensible today 400 years after they were written 4 but the works of geoffrey chaucer and william langland written only 200 years earlier are considerably more difficult for the average reader orthography edit shakespeare s writings are universally associated with early modern english the orthography of early modern english was fairly similar to that of today but spelling was unstable early modern english as well as modern english inherited orthographical conventions predating the great vowel shift the early modern english spelling system was similar to that of middle english certain changes were made however sometimes for reasons of etymology as with the silent b that was added to words like debt doubt and subtle early modern english orthography had a number of features of spelling that have not been retained the letter s had two distinct lowercase forms s short s as used today and long s the short s was always used at the end of a word and many times in other parts of the word and the long s if used could appear anywhere except at the end the double lowercase s was variously written s or cf the german ligature 5 this is similar to the alternation between medial and final lower case sigma in greek u and v were not yet considered two distinct letters but different forms of the same letter typographically v was frequently used at the start of a word and u elsewhere 6 hence vnmoued for modern unmoved and loue for love the modern convention of using u for the vowel sound s and v for the consonant appears to have been introduced in the 1630s 7 also w was frequently represented by vv similarly i and j were also not yet considered two distinct letters but different forms of the same letter hence ioy for joy and iust for just again the custom of using i as a vowel and j as a consonant is first found in the 1630s 7 the letter thorn was still in use during the early modern english period though increasingly limited to hand-written texts in early modern english printing was represented by the latin y see ye olde which appeared similar to thorn in blackletter typeface thorn fell into near-total disuse by the late early modern english period the last vestiges of the letter were its ligatures ye thee yt that yu thou which were still seen occasionally in the king james bible of 1611 and in shakespeare s folios 8 a silent e was often appended to words as in peake and cowarde the last consonant was sometimes doubled when this e was appended hence manne for man and runne for run the sound was often written o as in son hence ommer plombe for modern summer plumb 9 the final syllable of words like public was variously spelt but came to be standardised as -ick the modern spellings with -ic did not come into use until the mid-18th century 10 much was not standard however for example the word he could be spelled he or hee in the same sentence as it is found in shakespeare s plays phonology edit consonants edit most consonant sounds of early modern english have survived into present-day english however there are still a few notable differences in pronunciation today s silent consonants found in the consonant clusters of such words as knot gnat sword were still fully pronounced up until the middle or end of the 16th century but were fully reduced by the early 17th century at the latest 11 the silent l of would and should for example may have even persisted up until the year 1700 in britain and perhaps several decades longer in the british american colonies 12 most words with the spelling wh such as what where and whale were still pronounced rather than w this means for example that wine and whine were not perfect homophones as they are today in most varieties of english 13 early modern english was rhotic 13 though the precise nature of the typical rhotic consonant remains unclear citation needed however it was certainly one of the following the r heard in most present-day varieties of english the trilled or rolled r r the retroflex r in early modern english the precise nature of the light and dark variants of the l consonant l and respectively remains unclear word-final ng as in sing was still pronounced up until the end of the 16th century during which it began to coalesce into its more typically modern pronunciation of h-dropping at the start of words was common as is common today in informal english throughout most of england 13 pure vowels and diphthongs edit the following information primarily comes from studies of the great vowel shift 14 15 see the the modern english phoneme a as in glide rhyme and eye was i and later i early modern rhymes indicate that i was also the vowel used at the end of words like happy melody and busy a as in now out and ploughed was u as in cab trap and sad was more or less the same as the phoneme represents as in fed elm and hen was more or less the same as the phoneme represents or perhaps a slightly higher sometimes approaching as still retained in the word pretty 13 e as in name case and sake was a long monophthongal vowel approximating perhaps at first more open such as with shakespeare rhyming words like haste taste and waste with a fronted last or shade with sad 16 and later less open such as this phoneme was just beginning or already in the process of merging with the phoneme i as in day pay and say depending upon the exact timeframe or dialect within early modern english met was a potential homophone with mate or even mat with mate such an open pronunciation of this vowel is retained today only in some dialects mostly of northern england english i typically spelled ee or ie as in see bee and meet was more or less the same as the phoneme represents however it had not yet merged with the phoneme represented by the spellings ea or ei and perhaps ie particularly with fiend field and friend as in east meal or feat which was pronounced e or 17 16 although words like breath dead and head may have already split off towards as in bib pin and thick was more or less the same as the phoneme represents o as in stone bode and yolk was o or o this phoneme was probably just beginning the process of merging with the phoneme ou as in grow know and mow without yet achieving today s complete merger this pronunciation is also retained today in some dialects such as yorkshire or scottish english as in rod top and pot was or as in taut taught and law was or as in boy choice and toy is less clear than other vowels by the end of the 16th century the similar but distinct phonemes i and all existed by the end of the 17th century only still remained 18 because these phonemes were in such a state of flux during the whole early modern period with evidence of rhyming occurring among these phonemes as well as with the precursor to a scholars 11 often assume only the most neutral possibility for the pronunciation of as well as its similar phonemes in early modern english which if accurate would constitute an early instance of the line loin merger since a had not yet fully developed in english as in drum enough love etc and as in could full put etc had not yet split and were instead both pronounced in the vicinity of u was approximately the same as the phoneme represents however it incorporated not just words like food moon and stool but all words with the oo spelling including blood cook and foot the nature of the vowel sound in the latter group of words however is further complicated since the vowel for some of these words was shortened just beginning or already in the process of approximating the early modern english and later so that for instance at certain stages of the early modern period and or in certain dialects doom and come rhymed this phonological split among the oo words a catalyst for the later foot strut split has been called early shortening by modern phonologists 19 the oo words pronounced as something like seem to have included at least blood brood doom good and noon 20 or iu occurred in words spelled with ew or ue such as due and dew in most dialects of modern english it became ju and u through yod-dropping making do dew and due perfect homophones a distinction between the two phonemes only remains in welsh english and other conservative dialects rhotic vowels edit it is clear that the r sound the phoneme r was probably always pronounced following vowel sounds more in the style of today s northern english irish or scottish accents and less like today s typical london or standard british accents furthermore and were not necessarily merged before r as they are in most modern english dialects the stressed modern phoneme r when spelled er ear and perhaps or as in clerk earth or divert used a vowel sound with an a-like quality perhaps approximately or 16 with the spelling or the sound may have been backed more to thus in words like worth and word 16 in some pronunciations words like fair and fear with the spellings air and ear rhymed with each other while words with the spelling are such as prepare or compare were sometimes pronounced with a more open vowel sound like the verbs are and scar see great vowel shift later mergers for more particular words edit nature was pronounced approximately as n t neh-ter 13 perhaps perfectly rhyming with letter or early on even with latter one may have merged to the sound of own with both one and other using the era s long goat vowel rather than today s strut vowels 13 tongue merged to the sound of tong rhyming with song 16 grammar edit pronouns edit beginning of the epistle to the hebrews in the 1611 king james bible god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last dayes spoken unto us by his sonne whom he hath appointed heire of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightnesse of his glory and the expresse image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when hee had by himselfe purged our sinnes sate down on ye right hand of the maiestie on high being made so much better then the angels as hee hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name then they early modern english has two second-person personal pronouns thou the informal singular pronoun and ye both the plural pronoun and the formal singular pronoun thou and ye were both in habitual use in the early 1500s they can be seen for example in the disputes over tyndale s translating of the bible in the 1520s and 30s but by 1650 thou seems old-fashioned or literary citation needed it has effectively completely disappeared from modern standard english but it does remain in use in some situations in many churches in the uk and usa primarily those that use the king james bible thou is still used to address god in prayer where it is felt to denote reverence learning to handle the -est verb endings is something of a stumbling block for new christians learning to pray in public in such churches nearly all who do so manage by acquiring the knack of inserting the auxiliary dost for all present tenses and didst for all past tenses not thou tellest us in thy word but thou dost tell us not thou sentest thy son but thou didst send or even hast sent thou also remains in regular use in particular regional english dialects though its pronunciation is often reduced to tha citation needed the translators of the king james version of the bible begun 1604 - published 1611 - when shakespeare was at the height of his popularity had a particular reason for keeping the thou thee thy thine forms which were slowly beginning to fall out of spoken use namely that it enabled them to match the hebrew and greek distinction between second person singular thou and plural ye they did not use thou to denote reverence as can be seen by the fact that in the kjv god himself addresses individual people and even satan as thou - they used it purely to denote singular but over the centuries the very fact that thou was dropping out of normal use gave it a special aura that gradually came to be used to express reverence in hymns and prayer citation needed like other personal pronouns thou and ye have different forms dependent on their grammatical case specifically the objective form of thou is thee its possessive forms are thy and thine and its reflexive or emphatic form is thyself the objective form of ye was you its possessive forms are your and yours and its reflexive or emphatic forms are yourself and yourselves my and thy become mine and thine before words beginning with a vowel or the letter h more accurately the older forms mine and thine had become my and thy before words beginning with a consonant other than h while mine and thine were retained before words beginning with a vowel or h as in mine eyes or thine hand personal pronouns in early modern english nominative oblique genitive possessive 1st person singular i me my mine 1 mine plural we us our ours 2nd person singular informal thou thee thy thine 1 thine plural or formal singular ye you you your yours 3rd person singular he she it him her it his her his it 2 his hers his 2 plural they them their theirs a b the genitives my mine thy and thine are used as possessive adjectives before a noun or as possessive pronouns without a noun all four forms are used as possessive adjectives mine and thine are used before nouns beginning in a vowel sound or before nouns beginning in the letter h which was usually silent e g thine eyes and mine heart which was pronounced as mine art and my and thy before consonants thy mother my love however only mine and thine are used as possessive pronouns as in it is thine and they were mine not they were my a b from the early early modern english period up until the 17th century his was the possessive of the third-person neuter it as well as of the third-person masculine he genitive it appears once in the 1611 king james bible leviticus 25 5 as groweth of it owne accord verbs edit marking tense and number edit during the early modern period english verb inflections became simplified as they evolved towards their modern forms the third-person singular present lost its alternate inflections - e th became obsolete while -s survived the alternate forms coexistence can be seen in shakespeare s phrase with her that hateth thee and hates us all 21 the plural present form became uninflected present plurals had been marked with -en and singulars with -th or -s -th and -s survived the longest especially with the singular use of is hath and doth 22 marked present plurals were rare throughout the early modern period though and -en was probably only used as a stylistic affectation to indicate rural or old-fashioned speech 23 the second-person singular was marked in both the present and past tenses with -st or -est for example in the past tense walkedst or gav st 24 since the indicative past was not and is not otherwise marked for person or number 25 the loss of thou made the past subjunctive indistinguishable from the indicative past for all verbs except to be modal auxiliaries edit the modal auxiliaries cemented their distinctive syntactical characteristics during the early modern period thus the use of modals without an infinitive became rare as in i must to coventry i ll none of that the use of modals present participles to indicate aspect as in maeyinge suffer no more the loue deathe of aurelio from 1556 and of their preterite forms to indicate tense as in he follow d horace so very close that of necessity he must fall with him also became uncommon 26 some verbs ceased to function as modals during the early modern period the present form of must mot became obsolete dare also lost the syntactical characteristics of a modal auxiliary evolving a new past form dared distinct from the modal durst 27 perfect and progressive forms edit the perfect of the verbs had not yet been standardised to use uniformly the auxiliary verb to have some took as their auxiliary verb to be as in this example from the king james bible but which of you will say unto him when he is come from the field go and sit down luke xvii 7 the rules that determined which verbs took which auxiliaries were similar to those still observed in german and french see unaccusative verb the modern syntax used for the progressive aspect i am walking became dominant by the end of the early modern period but other forms were also common these included the prefix a- i am a-walking and the infinitive paired with do i do walk moreover the to be -ing verb form could be used to express a passive meaning without any additional markers the house is building could mean the house is being built 28 vocabulary edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may
