islands in the channel the most notable being the isle of wight off the english coast and the channel islands british crown dependencies off the coast of france the coastline particularly on the french shore is deeply indented several small islands close to the coastline including chausey and mont saint-michel are within french jurisdiction the cotentin peninsula in france juts out into the channel whilst on the english side there is a small parallel strait known as the solent between the isle of wight and the mainland the celtic sea is to the west of the channel the channel acts as a funnel that amplifies the tidal range from less than a metre as observed at sea clarification needed to more than 6 metres as observed in the channel islands the west coast of the cotentin peninsula and the north coast of brittany the time difference of about six hours between high water at the eastern and western limits of the channel is indicative of the tidal range being amplified further by

and around the english channel coastline in england grew rapidly into thriving seaside resorts bolstered by their association with royalty and the middle and upper classes until the 18th century the english channel had no fixed name either in english or in french it was never defined as a political border and the names were more or less descriptive it was not considered as the property of a nation strangely before the development of the modern nations british scholars very often referred to it as gaulish gallicum in latin and french scholars as british or english 21 the name english channel has been widely used since the early 18th century possibly originating from the designation engelse kanaal in dutch sea maps from the 16th century onwards in modern dutch however it is known as het kanaal with no reference to the word english 22 later it has also been known as the british channel 23 or the british sea it was called oceanus britannicus by the 2nd-century geographer ptolemy the same name is used on an italian map of about 1450 which gives the alternative name of canalites anglie possibly the first recorded use of the channel designation 24 the anglo-saxon texts often call it s -s south sea as opposed to nor -s north sea bristol channel the common word channel was first recorded in middle english in the 13th century and was borrowed from old french chanel variant form of chenel canal the french name la manche has been in use since at least the 17th century 2 the name is usually said to refer to the channel s sleeve french la manche shape folk etymology has derived it from a celtic word meaning channel that is also the source of the name for the minch in scotland 25 but this name was never mentioned before the 17th century and french and british sources of that time are perfectly clear about its etymology 26 the name in breton mor breizh means breton sea and its cornish name mor bretannek means british sea geological origins giant waterfalls and catastrophic floods edit the channel is of geologically recent origin having been dry land for most of the pleistocene period 27 before the devensian glaciation the most recent ice age which ended around 10,000 years ago britain and ireland were part of continental europe linked by an unbroken weald-artois anticline a ridge that acted as a natural dam holding back a large freshwater pro-glacial lake in the doggerland region now submerged under the north sea during this period the north sea and almost all of the british isles were covered by ice the lake was fed by meltwater from the baltic and from the caledonian and scandinavian ice sheets that joined to the north blocking its exit the sea level was about 120 m 390 ft lower than it is today then between 450,000 and 180,000 years ago at least two catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods breached the weald artois anticline the first flood would have lasted for several months releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second 28 29 the flood started with large but localized waterfalls over the ridge which excavated depressions now known as the fosses dangeard the flow eroded the retaining ridge causing the rock dam to fail and releasing lake water into the atlantic after multiple episodes of changing sea level during which the fosses dangeard were largely infilled by various layers of sediment another catastrophic flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley the lobourg channel some 500 m wide and 25 m deep from the southern north sea basin through the centre of the straits of dover and into the english channel it left streamlined islands longitudinal erosional grooves and other features characteristic of catastrophic megaflood events still present on the sea floor and now revealed by high-resolution sonar 30 31 32 through the scoured channel passed a river which drained the combined rhine and thames westwards to the atlantic the flooding destroyed the ridge that connected britain to continental europe although a land connection across the southern north sea would have existed intermittently at later times when periods of glaciation resulted in lowering of sea levels 33 at the end of the last glacial period rising sea levels finally severed the last land connection human geography edit this precious stone set in the silver sea which serves it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house against the envy of less happier lands william shakespeare richard ii act ii scene 1 the channel which delayed human reoccupation of great britain for more than 100,000 years 34 has in historic times been both an easy entry for seafaring people and a key natural defence halting invading armies while in conjunction with control of the north sea allowing britain to blockade the continent citation needed the most significant failed invasion threats came when the dutch and belgian ports were held by a major continental power e g from the spanish armada in 1588 napoleon during the napoleonic wars and nazi germany during world war ii successful invasions include the roman conquest of britain and the norman conquest in 1066 while the concentration of excellent harbours in the western channel on britain s south coast made possible the largest invasion of all time the normandy landings in 1944 channel naval battles include the battle of the downs 1639 battle of goodwin sands 1652 the battle of portland 1653 the battle of la hougue 1692 and the engagement between uss kearsarge and css alabama 1864 in more peaceful times the channel served as a link joining shared cultures and political structures particularly the huge angevin empire from 1135 to 1217 for nearly a thousand years the channel also provided a link between the modern celtic regions and languages of cornwall and brittany brittany was founded by britons who fled cornwall and devon after anglo-saxon encroachment in brittany there is a region known as cornouaille cornwall in french and kernev in breton 35 in ancient times there was also a domnonia devon in brittany as well in february 1684 ice formed on the sea in a belt 3 miles 4.8 km wide off the coast of kent and 2 miles 3.2 km

have been found on the isle of wight wheat was traded across the channel about 8,000 years ago 38 39 sophisticated social networks linked the neolithic front in southern europe to the mesolithic peoples of northern europe the ferriby boats hanson log boats and the later dover bronze age boat could carry a substantial cross-channel cargo 40 diodorus siculus and pliny 41 both suggest trade between the rebel celtic tribes of armorica and iron age britain flourished in 55 bc julius caesar invaded claiming that the britons had aided the veneti against him the previous year he was more successful in 54 bc but britain was not fully established as part of the roman empire until completion of the invasion by aulus plautius in 43 ad a brisk and regular trade began between ports in roman gaul and those in britain this traffic continued until the end of roman rule in britain in 410 ad after which the early anglo-saxons left less clear historical records in the power vacuum left by the retreating romans the germanic angles saxons and jutes began the next great migration across the north sea having already been used as mercenaries in britain by the romans many people from these tribes crossed during the migration period conquering and perhaps displacing the native celtic populations 42 norsemen and normans edit the hermitage of st helier lies in the bay off saint helier and is accessible on foot at low tide the attack on lindisfarne in 793 is generally considered the beginning of the viking age for the next 250 years the scandinavian raiders of norway sweden and denmark dominated the north sea raiding monasteries homes and towns along the coast and along the rivers that ran inland according to the anglo-saxon chronicle they began to settle in britain in 851 they continued to settle in the british isles and the continent until around 1050 43 the fiefdom of normandy was created for the viking leader rollo also known as robert of normandy rollo had besieged paris but in 911 entered vassalage to the king of the west franks charles the simple through the treaty of st -claire-sur-epte in exchange for his homage and fealty rollo legally gained the territory he and his viking allies had previously conquered the name normandy reflects rollo s viking i e northman origins the descendants of rollo and his followers adopted the local gallo-romance language and intermarried with the area s inhabitants and became the normans a norman french-speaking mixture of scandinavians hiberno-norse orcadians anglo-danish and indigenous franks and gauls rollo s descendant william duke of normandy became king of england in 1066 in the norman conquest beginning with the battle of hastings while retaining the fiefdom of normandy for himself and his descendants in 1204 during the reign of king john mainland normandy was taken from england by france under philip ii while insular normandy the channel islands remained under english control in 1259 henry iii of england recognised the legality of french possession of mainland normandy under the treaty of paris his successors however often fought to regain control of mainland normandy with the rise of william the conqueror the north sea and channel began to lose some of their importance the new order oriented most of england and scandinavia s trade south toward the mediterranean and the orient although the british surrendered claims to mainland normandy and other french possessions in 1801 the monarch of the united kingdom retains the title duke of normandy in respect to the channel islands the channel islands except for chausey are crown dependencies of the british crown thus the loyal toast in the channel islands is la reine notre duc the queen our duke the british monarch is understood to not be the duke of normandy in regards of the french region of normandy described herein by virtue of the treaty of paris of 1259 the surrender of french possessions in 1801 and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to salic law which excludes inheritance through female heirs french normandy was occupied by english forces during the hundred years war in 1346 1360 and again in 1415 1450 england and britain naval superpower edit from the reign of elizabeth i english foreign policy concentrated on preventing invasion across the channel by ensuring no major european power controlled the potential dutch and flemish invasion ports her climb to the pre-eminent sea power of the world began in 1588 as the attempted invasion of the spanish armada was defeated by the combination of outstanding naval tactics by the english and the dutch under command of charles howard 1st earl of nottingham with sir francis drake second in command and the following stormy weather over the centuries the royal navy slowly grew to be the most powerful in the world 44 the building of the british empire was possible only because the royal navy eventually managed to exercise unquestioned control over the seas around europe especially the channel and the north sea during the seven years war france attempted to launch an invasion of britain to achieve this france needed to gain control of the channel for several weeks but was thwarted following the british naval victory at the battle of quiberon bay in 1759 another significant challenge to british domination of the seas came during the napoleonic wars the battle of trafalgar took place off the coast of spain against a combined french and spanish fleet and was won by admiral horatio nelson ending napoleon s plans for a cross-channel invasion and securing british dominance of the seas for over a century first world war edit the exceptional strategic importance of the channel as a tool for blockade was recognised by the first sea lord admiral fisher in the years before world war i five keys lock up the world singapore the cape alexandria gibraltar dover 45 however on 25 july 1909 louis bl riot made the first channel crossing from calais to dover in an aeroplane bl riot s crossing signalled the end of the channel as a barrier-moat for england against foreign enemies because the kaiserliche marine surface fleet could not match the british grand fleet the germans developed submarine warfare which was to become a far greater threat to britain the dover patrol was set up just before the war started to escort cross-channel troopships and to prevent submarines from sailing in the channel obliging them to travel to the atlantic via the much longer route around scotland on land the german army attempted to capture channel ports in the race to the sea but although the trenches are often said to have stretched from the frontier of switzerland to the english channel they reached the coast at the north sea much of the british war effort in flanders was a bloody but successful strategy to prevent the germans reaching the channel coast at the outset of the war an attempt was made to block the path of u-boats through the dover strait with naval minefields by february 1915 this had been augmented by a 25 kilometres 16 mi stretch of light steel netting called the dover barrage which it was hoped would ensnare submerged submarines after initial success the germans learned how to pass through the barrage aided by the unreliability of british mines 46 on 31 january 1917 the germans restarted unrestricted submarine warfare leading to dire admiralty predictions that submarines would defeat britain by november 47 the most dangerous situation britain faced in either world war the battle of passchendaele in 1917 was fought to reduce the threat by capturing the submarine bases on the belgian coast though it was the introduction of convoys and not capture of the bases that averted defeat in april 1918 the dover patrol carried out the famous zeebrugge raid against the u-boat bases during 1917 the dover barrage was re-sited with improved mines and more effective nets aided by regular patrols by small warships equipped with powerful searchlights a german attack on these vessels resulted in the battle of dover strait in 1917 48 a much more ambitious attempt to improve the barrage by installing eight massive concrete towers across the strait was called the admiralty m-n scheme but only two towers were nearing completion at the end of the war and the project was abandoned 49 the naval blockade in the channel and north sea was one of the decisive factors in the german defeat in 1918 50 second world war edit british radar facilities during the battle of britain 1940 during the second world war naval activity in the european theatre was primarily limited to the atlantic during the battle of france in may 1940 the german forces succeeded in capturing both boulogne and calais thereby threatening the line of retreat for the british expeditionary force by a combination of hard fighting and german indecision the port of dunkirk was kept open allowing 338,000 allied troops to be evacuated in operation dynamo more than 11,000 were evacuated from le havre during operation cycle 51 and a further 192,000 were evacuated from ports further down the coast in operation ariel in june 1940 52 the early stages of the battle of britain 53 featured air attacks on channel shipping and ports and until the normandy landings with the exception of the channel dash the narrow waters were too dangerous for major warships despite these early successes against shipping the germans did not win the air supremacy necessary for operation sealion the projected cross-channel invasion the channel subsequently became the stage for an intensive coastal war featuring submarines minesweepers and fast attack craft 54 150 mm second world war german gun emplacement

german-occupied france by allied troops caen cherbourg carentan falaise and other norman towns endured many casualties in the fight for the province which continued until the closing of the so-called falaise gap between chambois and montormel then liberation of le havre the channel islands were the only part of the british commonwealth occupied by germany excepting the part of egypt occupied by the afrika korps at the time of the second battle of el alamein which was a protectorate and not part of the commonwealth the german occupation of 1940 1945 was harsh with some island residents being taken for slave labour on the continent native jews sent to concentration camps partisan resistance and retribution accusations of collaboration and slave labour primarily russians and eastern europeans being brought to the islands to build fortifications citation needed the royal navy blockaded the islands from time to time particularly following the liberation of mainland normandy in 1944 intense negotiations resulted in some red cross humanitarian aid but there was considerable hunger and privation during the occupation particularly in the final months when the population was close to starvation the german troops on the islands surrendered on 9 may 1945 a day after the final surrender in mainland europe population edit the english channel coast is far more densely populated on the

investigation branch maib issued a safety bulletin saying it believed that in these most unusual circumstances gps use had actually contributed to the collision 60 the ships were maintaining a very precise automated course one directly behind the other rather than making use of the full width of the traffic lanes as a human navigator would a combination of radar difficulties in monitoring areas near cliffs a failure of a cctv system incorrect operation of the anchor the inability of the crew to follow standard procedures of using a gps to provide early warning of the ship dragging the anchor
