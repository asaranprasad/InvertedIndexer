notes 13 references 14 external links etymology edit oregon border welcome sign at denio nevada the earliest evidence of the name oregon has spanish origins the term orej n comes from the historical chronicle relaci n de la alta y baja california 1598 12 written by the new spaniard rodrigo motezuma and made reference to the columbia river when the spanish explorers penetrated into the actual north american territory that became part of the viceroyalty of new spain this chronicle is the first topographical and linguistic source with respect to the place name oregon there are also two other sources with spanish origins such as the name oregano which grows in the southern part of the region it is most probable that the american territory was named by the spaniards as there are some populations in spain such as arroyo del oreg n which is situated in the province of ciudad real also considering that the individualization in spanish language el orej n with the mutation of the letter g instead of j 13 another early use of the name spelled ouragon was in a 1765 petition by major robert rogers to the kingdom of great britain the term referred to the then-mythical river of the west the columbia river by 1778 the spelling had shifted to oregon 14 in his 1765 petition rogers wrote the rout sic is from the great lakes towards the head of the mississippi and from thence to the river called by the indians ouragon 15 one theory is that the name comes from the french word ouragan windstorm or hurricane which was applied to the river of the west based on native american tales of powerful chinook winds on the lower columbia river or perhaps from firsthand french experience with the chinook winds of the great plains at the time the river of the west was thought to rise in western minnesota and flow west through the great plains 16 joaquin miller explained in sunset magazine in 1904 how oregon s name was derived the name oregon is rounded down phonetically from aure il agua oragua or-a-gon oregon given probably by the same portuguese navigator that named the farallones after his first officer and it literally in a large way means cascades hear the waters you should steam up the columbia and hear and feel the waters falling out of the clouds of mount hood to understand entirely the full meaning of the name aure il agua oregon 17 another account endorsed as the most plausible explanation in the book oregon geographic names was advanced by george r stewart in a 1944 article in american speech according to stewart the name came from an engraver s error in a french map published in the early 18th century on which the ouisiconsink wisconsin river was spelled ouaricon-sint broken on two lines with the -sint below so there appeared to be a river flowing to the west named ouaricon according to the oregon tourism commission present-day oregonians r o ni nz 18 pronounce the state s name as or-uh-gun never or-ee-gone 7 after being drafted by the detroit lions in 2002 former oregon ducks quarterback joey harrington distributed orygun stickers to members of the media as a reminder of how to pronounce the name of his home state 19 20 the stickers are sold by the university of oregon bookstore 21 geography edit crater lake during summer oregon is 295 miles 475 km north to south at longest distance and 395 miles 636 km east to west at longest distance with an area of 98,381 square miles 254,810 km2 oregon is slightly larger than the united kingdom it is the ninth largest state in the united states 22 oregon s highest point is the summit of mount hood at 11,249 feet 3,429 m and its lowest point is the sea level of the pacific ocean along the oregon coast 23 oregon s mean elevation is 3,300 feet 1,006 m crater lake national park is the state s only national park and the site of crater lake the deepest lake in the united states at 1,943 feet 592 m 24 oregon claims the d river as the shortest river in the world 25 though the state of montana makes the same claim of its roe river 26 oregon is also home to mill ends park in portland 27 the smallest park in the world at 452 square inches 0.29 m2 oregon is split into eight geographical regions in western oregon oregon coast west of the coast range the willamette valley rogue valley cascade range and klamath mountains and in central and eastern oregon the columbia plateau the high desert and the blue mountains oregon lies in two time zones most of malheur county is in the mountain time zone while the rest of the state lies in the pacific time zone geology and terrain edit mount hood is the highest peak in oregon western oregon s mountainous regions home to three of the most prominent mountain peaks of the united states including mount hood were formed by the volcanic activity of the juan de fuca plate a tectonic plate that poses a continued threat of volcanic activity and earthquakes in the region the most recent major activity was the 1700 cascadia earthquake washington s mount st helens erupted in 1980 an event visible from northern oregon and affecting some areas there 28 the columbia river which forms much of oregon s northern border also played a major role in the region s geological evolution as well as its economic and cultural development the columbia is one of north america s largest rivers and one of two rivers to cut through the cascades the klamath river in southern oregon is the other about 15,000 years ago the columbia repeatedly flooded much of oregon during the missoula floods the modern fertility of the willamette valley is largely a result of those floods plentiful salmon made parts of the river such as celilo falls hubs of economic activity for thousands of years today oregon s landscape varies from rain forest in the coast range to barren desert in the southeast which still meets the technical definition of a frontier oregon s geographical center is further west than any of the other 48 contiguous states although the westernmost point of the lower 48 states is in washington central oregon s geographical features range from high desert and volcanic rock formations resulting from lava beds the oregon badlands wilderness is in this region of the state 29 flora and fauna edit typical of a western state oregon is home to a unique and diverse array of wildlife roughly 60 percent of the state is covered in forest 30 while the areas west of the cascades are more densely populated by forest making up around 80 percent of the landscape some 60 percent of oregon s forests are within federal land 30 oregon is the top timber producer of the lower 48 states 10 31 typical tree species include the douglas fir the state tree as well as redwood ponderosa pine generally east of the cascades western red cedar and hemlock 32 ponderosa pine are more common in the blue mountains in the eastern part of the state and firs are more common in the west pronghorn antelope in fort rock there are many species of mammals that live in the state which include but are not limited to opossums shrews moles little pocket mice great basin pocket mice dark kangaroo mouse california kangaroo rat chisel-toothed kangaroo rat ord s kangaroo rat 33 bats rabbits pikas mountain beavers chipmunks western gray squirrels yellow-bellied marmots beavers porcupines coyotes wolves red foxes common grey fox kit fox 34 black bears raccoons badgers skunks antelopes cougars bobcats lynxes deer elk and moose marine mammals include seals sea lions humpback whales killer whales gray whales blue whales sperm whales pacific white-sided dolphin and bottlenose dolphin 35 notable birds include american widgeons mallard ducks great blue herons bald eagles golden eagles western meadowlarks the state bird barn owls great horned owls rufous hummingbirds pileated woodpeckers wrens towhees sparrows and buntings 36 moose have not always inhabited the state but came to oregon in the 1960s the wallowa valley herd numbered about 60 as of 2013 37 gray wolves were extirpated from oregon around 1930 but have since found their way back most of them reside in northeast oregon but there are now two packs living in the south-central part of the state 38 although their existence in oregon is unconfirmed reports of grizzly bears still turn up and it is probable some still move into eastern oregon from idaho 39 oregon is home to what is considered the largest single organism in the world an armillaria solidipes fungus beneath the malheur national forest of eastern oregon 9 oregon has three national park sites crater lake national park in the southern part of the cascades john day fossil beds national monument east of the cascades and lewis and clark national and state historical parks on the north coast 40 41 climate edit k ppen climate types in oregon most of oregon has a generally mild climate though there is significant variation given the variety of landscapes across the state 42 the state s western region west of the cascade range has an oceanic climate populated by dense evergreen mixed forests western oregon s climate is heavily influenced by the pacific ocean the western third of oregon is very wet in the winter moderately to very wet during the spring and fall and dry during the summer the relative humidity of western oregon is high except during summer days which are semi-dry to semi-humid eastern oregon typically sees low humidity year-round 43 the state s southwestern portion particularly the rogue valley has a mediterranean climate with drier and sunnier winters and hotter summers similar to northern california 44 oregon s northeastern portion has a steppe climate and its high terrain regions have a subarctic climate like western europe oregon and the pacific northwest in general is considered warm for its latitude and the state has far milder winters at a given elevation than comparable latitudes elsewhere in north america such as the upper midwest ontario quebec and new england 43 however the state ranks fifth for coolest summer temperatures of any state in the country after maine idaho wyoming and alaska 45 the eastern two thirds of oregon which largely comprise high desert have cold snowy winters and very dry summers much of the east is semiarid to arid like the rest of the great basin though the blue mountains are wet enough to support extensive forests most of oregon receives significant snowfall but the willamette valley where 60 percent of the population lives 46 has considerably milder winters for its latitude and typically only sees light snowfall 43 oregon s highest recorded temperature is 119 f 48 c at pendleton on august 10 1898 and the lowest recorded temperature is 54 f 48 c at seneca on february 10 1933 47 history edit humans have inhabited the area that is now oregon for at least 15,000 years in recorded history mentions of the land date to as early as the 16th century during the 18th and 19th centuries european powers and later the united states quarreled over possession of the region until 1846 when the u s and great britain finalized division of the region oregon became a state on february 14 1859 and as of 2015 is home to over 4 million residents 48 earliest inhabitants edit paul shoaway a native of the umatilla tribe in the columbia plateau region 1899 while there is considerable evidence that paleo-indians inhabited the region the oldest evidence of habitation in oregon was found at fort rock cave and the paisley caves in lake county archaeologist luther cressman dated material from fort rock to 13,200 years ago 49 and there is evidence supporting inhabitants in the region at least 15,000 years ago 50 by 8000 bc there were settlements throughout the state with populations concentrated along the lower columbia river in the western valleys and around coastal estuaries during the prehistoric period the willamette valley region was flooded after the collapse of glacial dams from lake missoula located in what would later become montana these massive floods occurred during the last glacial period and filled the valley with 300 to 400 feet 91 to 122 m of water 51 by the 16th century oregon was home to many native american groups including the chinook coquille ko-kwell bannock chasta kalapuya klamath klickitat molalla nez perce takelma killamuk neah-kah-nie umatilla and umpqua 52 53 54 55 european and pioneer settlement edit the first europeans to visit oregon were spanish explorers led by juan rodr guez cabrillo who sighted southern oregon off the pacific coast in 1543 56 francis drake made his way to nehalem bay in 1579 and spent five weeks in the middle of summer repairing his ship he claimed the land between 38 48 degrees north latitude as a symbolic sovereign act for england 57 exploration was retaken routinely in 1774 starting with the expedition of the frigate santiago by juan jos p rez hern ndez see spanish expeditions to the pacific northwest and the coast of oregon became a valuable trading route to asia in 1778 british captain james cook also explored the coast 58 french canadian and m tis trappers and missionaries arrived in the eastern part of the state in the late 18th and early 19th centuries many having travelled as members of lewis and clark and the 1811 astor expeditions some stayed permanently including tienne lussier believed to be the first european farmer in the state of oregon the evidence of this french canadian presence can be found in the numerous names of french origin in that part of the state including malheur lake and the malheur river the grande ronde and deschutes rivers and the city of la grande fort astoria as established by john jacob astor in 1813 the lewis and clark expedition travelled through northern oregon also in search of the northwest passage they built their winter fort in 1805 06 at fort clatsop near the mouth of the columbia river staying at the encampment from december until march 59 british explorer david thompson also conducted overland exploration in 1811 while working for the north west company thompson became the first european to navigate the entire columbia river 60 stopping on the way at the junction of the snake river he posted a claim to the region for great britain and the north west company upon returning to montreal he publicized the abundance of fur-bearing animals in the area 61 also in 1811 new yorker john jacob astor financed the establishment of fort astoria at the mouth of the columbia river as a western outpost to his pacific fur company 62 this was the first permanent european settlement in oregon map of oregon country 1818 46 in the war of 1812 the british gained control of all pacific fur company posts the treaty of 1818 established joint british and american occupancy of the region west of the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean by the 1820s and 1830s the hudson s bay company dominated the pacific northwest from its columbia district headquarters at fort vancouver built in 1825 by the district s chief factor john mcloughlin across the columbia from present-day portland in 1841 the expert trapper and entrepreneur ewing young died leaving considerable wealth and no apparent heir and no system to probate his estate a meeting followed young s funeral at which a probate government was proposed 63 doctor ira babcock of jason lee s methodist mission was elected supreme judge 64 babcock chaired two meetings in 1842 at champoeg halfway between lee s mission and oregon city to discuss wolves and other animals of contemporary concern these meetings were precursors to an all-citizen meeting in 1843 which instituted a provisional government headed by an executive committee made up of david hill alanson beers and joseph gale 65 this government was the first acting public government of the oregon country before annexation by the government of the united states it was succeeded by a second executive committee made up of peter g stewart osborne russell and william j bailey and this committee was itself succeeded by george abernethy who was the first and only governor of oregon under the provisional government also in 1841 sir george simpson governor of the hudson s bay company reversed the hudson s bay company s long-standing policy of discouraging settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade 66 he directed that some 200 red river colony settlers be relocated to hbc farms near fort vancouver the james sinclair expedition in an attempt to hold columbia district starting in 1842 43 the oregon trail brought many new american settlers to the oregon country for some time it seemed that britain and the united states would go to war for a third time in 75 years see oregon boundary dispute but the border was defined peacefully in 1846 by the oregon treaty the border between the united states and british north america was set at the 49th parallel 67 the oregon territory was officially organized on august 13 1848 68 settlement increased with the donation land claim act of 1850 and the forced relocation of the native population to indian reservations in oregon statehood edit in december 1844 oregon passed its black exclusion law which prohibited african americans from entering the territory while simultaneously prohibiting slavery slave owners who brought their slaves with them were given three years before they were forced to free them any african americans in the region after the law was passed were forced to leave and those who did not comply were arrested and beaten they received no less than twenty and no more than thirty-nine stripes across their bare back if they still did not leave this process could be repeated every six months 69 slavery played a major part in oregon s history and even influenced its path to statehood the territory s request for statehood was delayed several times as members of congress argued among themselves whether the territory should be admitted as a free or slave state eventually politicians from the south agreed to allow oregon to enter as a free state in exchange for opening slavery to the southwest united states 70 oregon was admitted to the union on february 14 1859 founded as a refuge from disputes over slavery oregon had a whites only clause in its original state constitution 71 at the outbreak of the american civil war regular u s troops were withdrawn and sent east volunteer cavalry recruited in california were sent north to oregon to keep peace and protect the populace the first oregon cavalry served until june 1865 post-reconstruction edit downtown portland in 1898 beginning in the 1880s the growth of railroads expanded the state s lumber wheat and other agricultural markets and the rapid growth of its cities 72 due to the abundance of timber and waterway access via the willamette river portland became a major force in the lumber industry of the pacific northwest and quickly became the state s largest city it would earn the nickname stumptown 73 and would later become recognized as one of the most dangerous port cities in the united states due to racketeering and illegal activities at the turn of the 20th century 74 in 1902 oregon introduced direct legislation by the state s citizens through initiatives and referenda known as the oregon system 75 on may 5 1945 six people were killed by a japanese bomb that exploded on gearhart mountain near bly 76 77 this is the only fatal attack on the united states mainland committed by a foreign nation since the mexican american war making oregon the only u s state that has experienced fatal casualties by a foreign army since 1848 as hawaii was not yet a state when pearl harbor was attacked in 1941 the bombing site is now called the mitchell recreation area industrial expansion began in earnest following the 1933 37 construction of the bonneville dam on the columbia river hydroelectric power food and lumber provided by oregon helped fuel the development of the west although the periodic fluctuations in the u s building industry have hurt the state s economy on multiple occasions portland in particular experienced a population boom between 1900 and 1930 tripling in size the arrival of world war ii also provided the northwest region of the state with an industrial boom where liberty ships and aircraft carriers were constructed 78 during the 1970s the pacific northwest was particularly affected by the 1973 oil crisis with oregon suffering a substantial shortage 79 in 1994 oregon became the first u s state to legalize physician-assisted suicide through the oregon death with dignity act a measure to legalize recreational use of marijuana in oregon was approved on november 4 2014 making oregon only the second state at the time to have legalized gay marriage physician-assisted suicide and recreational marijuana 80 cities and towns edit oregon s population is largely concentrated in the willamette valley which stretches from eugene in the south home of the university of oregon through corvallis home of oregon state university and salem the capital to portland oregon s largest city 81 astoria at the mouth of the columbia river was the first permanent english-speaking settlement west of the rockies in what is now the united states oregon city at the end of the oregon trail was the oregon territory s first incorporated city and was its first capital from 1848 until 1852 when the capital was moved to salem bend near the geographic center of the

the oregon country book a pacific republic written in 1839 predicted the territory was to become an independent republic four years later in 1843 settlers of the willamette valley voted in majority for a republic government 85 the oregon country functioned in this way until august 13 1848 when oregon was annexed by the united states and a territorial government was established oregon maintained a territorial government until february 14 1859 when it was granted statehood 86 oregon state government has a separation of powers similar to the federal government it has three branches a legislative branch the bicameral oregon legislative assembly an executive branch which includes an administrative department and oregon s governor serving as chief executive and a judicial branch headed by the chief justice of the oregon supreme court governors in oregon serve four-year terms and are limited to two consecutive terms but an unlimited number of total terms oregon has no lieutenant governor in the event that the office of governor is vacated article v section 8a of the oregon constitution specifies that the secretary of state is first in line for succession 87 the other statewide officers are treasurer attorney general superintendent and labor commissioner the biennial oregon legislative assembly consists of a thirty-member senate and a sixty-member house the state supreme court has seven elected justices currently including the only two openly gay state supreme court justices in the nation they choose one of their own to serve a six-year term as chief justice the only court that may reverse or modify a decision of the oregon supreme court is the supreme court of the united states the debate over whether to move to annual sessions is a long-standing battle in oregon politics but the voters have resisted the move from citizen legislators to professional lawmakers because oregon s state budget is written in two-year increments and there being no sales tax state revenue is based largely on income taxes it is often significantly over- or under-budget recent legislatures have had to be called into special session repeatedly to address revenue shortfalls resulting from economic downturns bringing to a head the need for more frequent legislative sessions oregon initiative 71 passed in 2010 mandates the legislature to begin meeting every year

since the late 1990s oregon has been represented by four democrats and one republican in the u s house of representatives since 2009 the state has had two democratic u s senators ron wyden and jeff merkley oregon voters have elected democratic governors in every election since 1986 most recently electing kate brown over republican bud pierce in a 2016 special election the base of democratic support is largely concentrated in the urban centers of the willamette valley the eastern two-thirds of the state beyond the cascade mountains typically votes republican in 2000 and 2004 george w bush carried every county east of the cascades however the region s sparse population means that the more populous counties in the willamette valley usually outweigh the eastern counties in statewide elections in the 2002 general election oregon voters approved a ballot measure to increase the state minimum wage automatically each year according to inflationary changes which are measured by the consumer price index cpi 88 in the 2004 general election oregon voters passed ballot measures banning same-sex marriage 89 and restricting land use regulation 90 in the 2006 general election voters restricted the use of eminent domain and extended the state s discount prescription drug coverage 91 federal representation edit like all u s states oregon is represented by two senators since the 1980 census oregon has had five congressional districts after oregon was admitted to the union it began with a single member in the house of representatives la fayette grover who served in the 35th
