zodiacal light - wikipedia zodiacal light from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search zodiacal light in the eastern sky before the beginning of morning twilight play media astronomers at eso s observatories often encounter zodiacal light zodiacal light is a faint diffuse and roughly triangular white glow visible in the night sky that appears to extend from the vicinity of the sun along the ecliptic or zodiac 1 sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust in the zodiacal cloud causes this phenomenon zodiacal light is best seen during twilight after sunset in spring and before sunrise in autumn when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon however the glow is so faint that moonlight and or light pollution outshine it rendering it invisible the zodiacal light decreases in intensity with distance from the sun but in naturally dark skies it is visible as a band completely around the ecliptic in fact the zodiacal light covers the entire sky and is largely responsible 2 for the total natural skylight on a moonless clear night another phenomenon a faint but slightly brighter oval glow directly opposite of the sun is the gegenschein the dust in the solar system forms a thick pancake-shaped cloud collectively known as the zodiacal cloud which straddles the ecliptic plane the dust particles are between 10 and 300 micrometres in diameter most with a mass around 150 micrograms 3 contents 1 viewing 2 origin 3 appearance 4 cultural significance 4.1 importance to islam 4.2 brian may 5 see also 6 references 7 external links viewing edit zodiacal light seen with a green and red orionid meteor striking the sky below the milky way and to the right of venus in the mid-latitudes the zodiacal light is best observed in the western sky in the spring after the evening twilight has completely disappeared or in the eastern sky in the autumn just before the morning twilight appears the zodiacal light appears as a column brighter at the horizon tilted at the angle of the ecliptic the light scattered from extremely small dust particles is strongly forward scattering although the zodiacal light actually extends all the way around the sky hence it is brightest when observing at a small angle with the sun this is why it is most clearly visible near sunrise or sunset when the sun is blocked but the dust particles nearest the line of sight to the sun are not the dust band that causes the zodiacal light is uniform across the whole ecliptic the dust further from the ecliptic is almost undetectable except when viewed at a small angle with the sun thus it is possible to see more of the width at small angles toward the sun and it appears wider near the horizon closer to the sun under the horizon origin edit moonlight and zodiacal light over la silla observatory 4 the source of the dust has been long debated until recently it was thought that the dust originated from the tails of active comets and from collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt 5 many of our meteor showers have no known active comet parent bodies over 85 percent of the dust is attributed to occasional fragmentations of jupiter-family comets that are nearly dormant 6 jupiter-family comets have orbital periods of less than 20 years 7 and are considered dormant when not actively outgassing but may do so in the future 8 the first fully dynamical model of the zodiacal cloud demonstrated that only if the dust was released in orbits that approach jupiter is it stirred up enough to explain the thickness of the zodiacal dust cloud the dust in meteoroid streams is much larger 300 to 10,000 micrometres in diameter and falls apart into smaller zodiacal dust grains over time colorful center of the milky way and the zodiacal light above the very large telescope 9 the poynting robertson effect forces the dust into more circular but still elongated orbits while spiralling slowly into the sun hence a continuous source of new particles is needed to maintain the zodiacal cloud cometary dust and dust generated by collisions among the asteroids are believed to be mostly responsible for the maintenance of the dust cloud producing the zodiacal light and the gegenschein particles can be reduced in size by collisions or by space weathering when ground down to sizes less than 10 micrometres the grains are removed from the inner solar system by solar radiation pressure the dust is then replenished by the infall from comets zodiacal dust around nearby stars is called exozodiacal dust it is a potentially important source of noise for directly imaging extrasolar planets it has been pointed out that this exozodiacal dust or hot debris disks can be an indicator of planets as planets tend to scatter the comets to the inner solar system in 2015 new results from the secondary ion dust spectrometer cosima on board the esa rosetta orbiter confirmed that the parent bodies of interplanetary dust are most probably jupiter-family comets such as comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko 10 appearance edit false dawn 11 zodiacal light seen from paranal zodiacal light is produced by sunlight reflecting off dust particles in the solar system known as cosmic dust consequently its spectrum is the same as the solar spectrum the material producing the zodiacal light is located in a lens-shaped volume of space centered on the sun and extending well out beyond the orbit of earth this material is known as the interplanetary dust cloud since most of the material is located near the plane of the solar system the zodiacal light is seen along the ecliptic the amount of material needed to produce the observed zodiacal light is quite small if it were in the form of 1 mm particles each with the same albedo reflecting power as earth s moon each particle would be 8 km from its neighbors the gegenschein may be caused by particles directly opposite the sun as seen from earth which would be in full phase according to nesvorn and jenniskens when the dust grains are as small as about 150 micrometres in size they will hit the earth at an average speed of 14.5 km s many as slowly as 12 km s if so they pointed out this comet dust can survive entry in partially molten form accounting for the unusual attributes of the micrometeorites collected in antarctica which do not resemble the larger meteorites known to originate from asteroids in recent years observations by a variety of spacecraft have shown significant structure in the zodiacal light including dust bands associated with debris from particular asteroid families and several cometary trails cultural significance edit according to alexander von humboldt s kosmos mexicans were aware of the zodiacal light before 1500 12 it was perhaps first reported in print by joshua childrey in 1661 the phenomenon was investigated by the astronomer giovanni domenico cassini in 1683 according to some sources he explained it by dust particles around the sun 13 14 other sources state that it was first explained this way by nicolas fatio de duillier in 1684 15 whom cassini advised to study the zodiacal light 12 importance to islam edit the islamic prophet muhammed described zodiacal light in reference to the timing of the five daily prayers calling it the false dawn al-fajr al-k dhib muslim oral tradition preserves numerous sayings or hadith in which muhammed describes the difference between the light of false dawn appearing in the sky long after sunset and the light of the first band of horizontal light at sunrise the true dawn practitioners of islam use muhammed s descriptions of zodiacal light to avoid errors in determining the timing of daily prayers such practical descriptions and applications of astronomical observations were vital to the golden age of islamic astronomy use of the term false dawn in this context should not be confused with false sunrise which is a different unrelated optical phenomenon brian may edit in 2007 brian may lead guitarist with the band queen completed his phd thesis a survey of radial velocities in the zodiacal dust cloud 16 36 years after having started and abandoned it to pursue a career in music he was able to submit it only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic undertaken during the intervening years may describes the subject as being one that became trendy again in the 2000s 17 see also edit exozodiacal
