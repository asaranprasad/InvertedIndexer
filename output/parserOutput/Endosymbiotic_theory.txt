symbiogenesis - wikipedia symbiogenesis from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from endosymbiotic theory jump to navigation search internal symbiont mitochondrion has a matrix and membranes like a free-living proteobacterial cell from which it may derive symbiogenesis or endosymbiotic theory is an evolutionary theory of the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic organisms first articulated in 1905 and 1910 by the russian botanist konstantin mereschkowski and advanced and substantiated with microbiological evidence by lynn margulis in 1967 it holds that the organelles distinguishing eukaryote cells evolved through symbiosis of individual single-celled prokaryotes bacteria and archaea the theory holds that mitochondria plastids such as chloroplasts and possibly other organelles of eukaryotic cells represent formerly free-living prokaryotes taken one inside the other in endosymbiosis around 1.5 billion years ago in more detail mitochondria appear to be related to rickettsiales proteobacteria and chloroplasts to nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria among the many lines of evidence supporting symbiogenesis are that new mitochondria and plastids are formed only through binary fission and that cells cannot create new ones otherwise that the transport proteins called porins are found in the outer membranes of mitochondria chloroplasts and bacterial cell membranes that cardiolipin is found only in the inner mitochondrial membrane and bacterial cell membranes and that some mitochondria and plastids contain single circular dna molecules

symbiogenesis the incorporation of symbiotic bacteria to form nuclei and chloroplasts respectively 1 the theory of symbiogenesis greek syn together biosis living and genesis origin or birth was first outlined by the russian botanist konstantin mereschkowski in his 1905 work the nature and origins of chromatophores in the plant kingdom and then elaborated in his 1910 the theory of two plasms as the basis of symbiogenesis a new study or the origins of organisms 2 3 4 mereschkowski was familiar with work by botanist andreas schimper who had observed in 1883 that the division of chloroplasts in green plants closely resembled that of free-living cyanobacteria and who had himself tentatively proposed in a footnote that green plants had arisen from a symbiotic union of two organisms 5 in 1918 the french scientist paul portier fr published les symbiotes in which he claimed that the mitochondria originated from a symbiosis process 6 ivan wallin advocated the idea of an endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria in the 1920s 7 8 the russian botanist boris kozo-polyansky was the first to explain the theory in terms of darwinian evolution 9 in his 1924 book novyi printzip biologii ocherk teorii simbiogeneza the new principle of biology essay on the theory of symbiogenesis translated to english as symbiogenesis a new principle of evolution in 2010 10 he wrote the theory of symbiogenesis is a theory of selection relying on the phenomenon of symbiosis 11 these theories were initially dismissed or ignored more detailed electron microscopic comparisons between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts for example studies by hans ris published in 1961 12 combined with the discovery that plastids and mitochondria contain their own dna 13 which by that stage was recognized to be the hereditary material of organisms led to a resurrection of the idea in the 1960s the theory was advanced and substantiated with microbiological evidence by lynn margulis in a 1967 paper on the origin of mitosing cells 14 in her 1981 work symbiosis in cell evolution she argued that eukaryotic cells originated as communities of interacting entities including endosymbiotic spirochaetes that developed into eukaryotic flagella and cilia this last idea has not received much acceptance because flagella lack dna and do not show ultrastructural similarities to bacteria or archaea see also evolution of flagella and prokaryotic cytoskeleton according to margulis and dorion sagan 15 life did not take over the globe by combat but by networking i e by cooperation the possibility that peroxisomes may have an endosymbiotic origin has also been considered although they lack dna christian de duve proposed that they may have been the first endosymbionts allowing cells to withstand growing amounts of free molecular oxygen in the earth s atmosphere however it now appears that peroxisomes may be formed de novo contradicting the idea that they have a symbiotic origin 16 one model for the origin of mitochondria and plastids from endosymbionts to organelles edit modern endosymbiotic theory kwang jeon s experiment i amoebae infected by x-bacteria ii many amoebae become sick and die iii survivors have x-bacteria living in their cytoplasm iv antibiotics kill x-bacteria host amoebae die as now dependent on x-bacteria according to keeling and archibald 17 the usual way to distinguish organelles from endosymbionts is by their reduced genome sizes as an endosymbiont evolves into an organelle most of their genes are transferred to the host cell genome 18 the host cell and organelle need to develop a transport mechanism that enables the return of the protein products needed by the organelle but now manufactured by the cell cyanobacteria and -proteobacteria are the most closely related free-living organisms to plastids and mitochondria respectively 19 both cyanobacteria and -proteobacteria maintain a large 6mb genome encoding thousands of proteins 19 plastids and mitochondria exhibit a dramatic reduction in genome size when compared to their bacterial relatives 19 chloroplast genomes in photosynthetic organisms are normally 120-200kb 20 encoding 20-200 proteins 19 and mitochondrial genomes in humans are approximately 16kb and encode 37 genes 13 of which are proteins 21 using the example of the freshwater amoeboid however paulinella chromatophora which contains chromatophores found to be evolved from cyanobacteria keeling and archibald argue that this is not the only possible criterion another is that the host cell has assumed control of the regulation of the former endosymbiont s division thereby synchronizing it with the cell s own division 17 nowack and her colleagues 22 performed gene sequencing on the chromatophore 1.02 mb and found that only 867 proteins were encoded by these photosynthetic cells comparisons with their closest free living cyanobacteria of the genus synechococcus having a genome size 3 mb with 3300 genes revealed that chromatophores underwent a drastic genome shrinkage chromatophores contained genes that were accountable for photosynthesis but were deficient in genes that could carry out other biosynthetic functions this observation suggests that these endosymbiotic cells are highly dependent on their hosts for their survival and growth mechanisms thus these chromatophores were found to be non-functional for organelle-specific purposes when compared to mitochondria and plastids this distinction could have promoted the early evolution of photosynthetic organelles the loss of genetic autonomy that is the loss of many genes from endosymbionts occurred very early in evolutionary time 23 taking into account the entire original endosymbiont genome there are three main possible fates for genes over evolutionary time the first fate involves the loss of functionally redundant genes 23 in which genes that are already represented in the nucleus are eventually lost the second fate involves the transfer of genes to the nucleus 19 23 24 25 26 the loss of autonomy and integration of the endosymbiont with its host can be primarily attributed to nuclear gene transfer 26 as organelle genomes have been greatly reduced over evolutionary time nuclear genes have expanded and become more complex 19 as a result many plastid and mitochondrial processes are driven by nuclear encoded gene products 19 in addition many nuclear genes originating from endosymbionts have acquired novel functions unrelated to their organelles 19 26 the mechanisms of gene transfer are not fully known however multiple hypotheses exist to explain this phenomenon the cdna hypothesis involves the use of messenger rna mrnas to transport genes from organelles to the nucleus where they are converted to cdna and incorporated into the genome 19 24 the cdna hypothesis is based on studies of the genomes of flowering plants protein coding rnas in mitochondria are spliced and edited using organelle-specific splice and editing sites nuclear copies of some mitochondrial genes however do not contain organelle-specific splice sites suggesting a processed mrna intermediate the cdna hypothesis has since been revised as edited mitochondrial cdnas are unlikely to recombine with the nuclear genome and are more likely to recombine with their native mitochondrial genome if the edited mitochondrial sequence recombines with the mitochondrial genome mitochondrial splice sites would no longer exist in the mitochondrial genome any subsequent nuclear gene transfer would therefore also lack mitochondrial splice sites 19 the bulk flow hypothesis is the alternative to the cdna hypothesis stating that escaped dna rather than mrna is the mechanism of gene transfer 19 24 according to this hypothesis disturbances to organelles including autophagy normal cell destruction gametogenesis the formation of gametes and cell stress release dna which is imported into the nucleus and incorporated into the nuclear dna using non-homologous end joining repair of double stranded breaks 24 for example in the initial stages of endosymbiosis due to a lack of major gene transfer the host cell had little to no control over the endosymbiont the endosymbiont underwent cell division independently of the host cell resulting in many copies of the endosymbiont within the host cell some of the endosymbionts lysed burst and high levels of dna were incorporated into the nucleus a similar mechanism is thought to occur in tobacco plants who show a high rate of gene transfer and whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts 23 in addition the bulk flow hypothesis is also supported by the presence of non-random clusters of organelle genes suggesting the simultaneous movement of multiple genes 24 in 2015 the biologist roberto cazzolla gatti provided evidence for a variant theory 27 endogenosymbiosis in which not only are organelles endosymbiotic but that pieces of genetic material from symbiotic parasites gene carriers such as viruses retroviruses and bacteriophages are included in the host s nuclear dna changing the host s gene expression and contributing to the process of speciation 28 molecular and biochemical evidence suggests that mitochondria are related to rickettsiales proteobacteria in particular the sar11 clade 29 30 or close relatives and that chloroplasts are related to nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria 31 32 organellar genomes edit plastomes and mitogenomes edit the human mitochondrial genome has retained genes encoding 2 rrnas 22 trnas and 13 redox proteins the third and final possible fate of endosymbiont genes is that they remain in the organelles plastids and mitochondria although they have lost much of their genomes retain genes encoding rrnas trnas proteins involved in redox reactions and proteins required for transcription translation and replication 19 20 23 there are many hypotheses to explain why organelles retain a small portion of their genome however no one hypothesis will apply to all organisms 23 and the topic is still quite controversial 19 the hydrophobicity hypothesis states that highly hydrophobic water hating proteins such as the membrane bound proteins involved in redox reactions are not easily transported through the cytosol and therefore these proteins must be encoded in their respective organelles 19 23 the code disparity hypothesis states that the limit on transfer is due to differing genetic codes and rna editing between the organelle and the nucleus 23 the redox control hypothesis states that genes encoding redox reaction proteins are retained in order to effectively couple the need for repair and the synthesis of these proteins 19 20 23 for example if one of the photosystems is lost from the plastid the intermediate electron carriers may lose or gain too many electrons signalling the need for repair of a photosystem 20 the time delay involved in signalling the nucleus and transporting a cytosolic protein to the organelle results in the production of damaging reactive oxygen species 19 20 23 the final hypothesis states that the assembly of membrane proteins particularly those involved in redox reactions requires coordinated synthesis and assembly of subunits however translation and protein transport coordination is more difficult to control in the cytoplasm 23 non-photosynthetic plastid genomes edit the majority of the genes in the mitochondria and plastids are related to the expression transcription translation and replication of genes encoding proteins involved in either photosynthesis in plastids or cellular respiration in mitochondria 19 20 23 one might predict that the loss of photosynthesis or cellular respiration would allow for the complete loss of the plastid genome or the mitochondrial genome respectively 23 while there are numerous examples of mitochondrial descendants mitosomes and hydrogenosomes that have lost their entire organellar genome 33 non-photosynthetic plastids tend to retain a small genome 23 there are two main hypotheses to explain this occurrence the essential trna hypothesis notes that there have been no documented functional plastid-to-nucleus gene transfers of genes encoding rna products trnas and rrnas as a result plastids must make their own functional rnas or import nuclear counterparts the genes encoding trna-glu and trna-fmet however appear to be indispensable the plastid is responsible for haem biosynthesis which requires plastid encoded trna-glu from the gene trne as a precursor molecule like other genes encoding rnas trne cannot be transferred to the nucleus in addition it is unlikely trne could be replaced by a cytosolic trna-glu as trne is highly conserved single base changes in trne have resulted in the loss of haem synthesis the gene for trna-formylmethionine trna-fmet is also encoded in the plastid genome and is required for translation initiation in both plastids and mitochondria a plastid is required to continue expressing the gene for trna-fmet so long as the mitochondrion is translating proteins 23 the limited window hypothesis offers a more general explanation for the retention of genes in non-photosynthetic plastids 34 according to the bulk flow hypothesis genes are transferred to the nucleus following the disturbance of organelles 24 disturbance was common in the early stages of endosymbiosis however once the host cell gained control of organelle division eukaryotes could evolve to have only one plastid per cell having only one plastid severely limits gene transfer 23 as the lysis of the single plastid would likely result in cell death 23 34 consistent with this hypothesis organisms with multiple plastids show an 80-fold increase in plastid-to-nucleus gene transfer compared to organisms with single plastids 34 evidence edit there are many lines of evidence that mitochondria and plastids including chloroplasts arose from bacteria 35 36 37 38 39 new mitochondria and plastids are formed only through binary fission the form of cell division used by bacteria and archaea 40 if a cell s mitochondria or chloroplasts are removed the cell does not have the means to create new ones 41 for example in some algae such as euglena the plastids can be destroyed by certain chemicals or prolonged absence of light without otherwise affecting the cell in such a case the plastids will not regenerate transport proteins called porins are found in the outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts and are also found in bacterial cell membranes 42 43 44 a membrane lipid cardiolipin is exclusively found in the inner mitochondrial membrane and bacterial cell membranes 45 some mitochondria and some plastids contain single circular dna molecules that are similar to the dna of bacteria both in size and structure 46 genome comparisons suggest a close relationship between mitochondria and rickettsial bacteria 47 genome comparisons suggest a close relationship between plastids and cyanobacteria 48 many genes in the genomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts have been lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host cell consequently the chromosomes of many eukaryotes contain genes that originated from the genomes of mitochondria and plastids 46 mitochondrial and plastid ribosomes are more similar to those of bacteria 70s than those of eukaryotes 49 proteins created by mitochondria and chloroplasts use n-formylmethionine as the initiating amino acid as do proteins created by bacteria but not proteins created by eukaryotic nuclear genes or archaea 50 51 comparison of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria showing their similarities secondary endosymbiosis edit primary endosymbiosis involves the engulfment of a cell by another free living organism secondary endosymbiosis occurs when the product of primary endosymbiosis is itself engulfed and retained by another free living eukaryote secondary endosymbiosis has occurred several times and has given rise to extremely diverse groups of algae and other eukaryotes some organisms can take opportunistic advantage of a similar process where they engulf an alga and use the products of its photosynthesis but once the prey item dies or is lost the host returns to a free living state obligate secondary endosymbionts become dependent on their organelles and are unable to survive in their absence for a review see mcfadden 2001 52 redtol the red algal tree of life initiative funded by the national science foundation highlights the role red algae or rhodophyta played in the evolution of our planet through secondary endosymbiosis one possible secondary endosymbiosis in process has been observed by okamoto inouye 2005 the heterotrophic protist hatena behaves like a predator until it ingests a green alga which loses its flagella and cytoskeleton while hatena now a host switches to photosynthetic nutrition gains the ability to move towards light and loses its feeding apparatus 53 the process of secondary endosymbiosis left its evolutionary signature within the unique topography of plastid membranes secondary plastids are surrounded by three in euglenophytes and some dinoflagellates or four membranes in haptophytes heterokonts cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes the two additional membranes are thought to correspond to the plasma membrane of the engulfed alga and the phagosomal membrane of the host cell the endosymbiotic acquisition of a eukaryote cell is represented in the cryptophytes where the remnant nucleus of the red algal symbiont the nucleomorph is present between the two inner and two outer plastid membranes citation needed despite the diversity of organisms containing plastids the morphology biochemistry genomic organisation and molecular phylogeny of plastid rnas and proteins suggest a single origin of all extant plastids although this theory is still debated 54 55 some species including pediculus humanus lice have multiple chromosomes in the mitochondrion this and the phylogenetics of the genes encoded within the mitochondrion suggest that mitochondria have multiple ancestors that these were acquired by endosymbiosis on several occasions rather than just once and that there have been extensive mergers and rearrangements of genes on the several original mitochondrial chromosomes 56 see also edit angomonas deanei a protozoan that harbours an
