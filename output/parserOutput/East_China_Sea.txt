edit there are disputes between the people s republic of china prc japan and south korea over the extent of their respective exclusive economic zones eez 4 the dispute between the prc and japan concerns the different application of the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos which both nations have ratified 5 china and japan both claim 200 nautical miles eez rights but the east china sea width is only 360 nautical miles 6 china proposed the application of unclos considering the natural prolongation of its continental shelf advocating that the eez extends as far as the okinawa trough 7 8 its ministry of foreign affairs has stated that the natural prolongation of the continental shelf of china in the east china sea extends to the okinawa trough and beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of china is measured 7 which is applicable to the relevant unclos provisions that support china s right to the natural shelf 7 8 in 2012 china presented a submission under the unclos concerning the outer limits of the continental shelf to the un 9 10 however japan claims about 40,000 square kilometers part of this territory as its own eez because it is within 200 nautical miles 370 km from its coast and thus proposed the median line division of the eez 6 11 view of east china sea from yeliou taiwan in 1995 the people s republic of china prc discovered an undersea natural gas field in the east china sea namely the chunxiao gas field 12 which lies within the chinese eez while japan believes it is connected to other possible reserves beyond the median line 13 japan has objected to prc development of natural gas resources in the east china sea near the area where the two countries exclusive economic zone eez claims overlap the specific development in dispute is the prc s drilling in the chunxiao gas field which is located in undisputed areas on china s side three or four miles 6 km west of the median line proposed by japan japan maintains that although the chunxiao gas field rigs are on the prc side of a median line that tokyo regards as the two sides sea boundary they may tap into a field that stretches underground into the disputed area 14 japan therefore seeks a share in the natural gas resources the gas fields in the xihu sag area in the east china sea canxue baoyunting chunxiao duanqiao wuyunting and tianwaitian are estimated to hold proven reserves of 364 bcf of natural gas 15 commercial operations began 2006 in june 2008 both sides agreed to jointly develop the chunxiao gas fields
