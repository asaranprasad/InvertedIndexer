oldest space center its original charter was to perform five major functions on behalf of nasa technology development and fabrication planning scientific research technical operations and project management the center is organized into several directorates each charged with one of these key functions until may 1 1959 nasa s presence in greenbelt maryland was known as the beltsville space center it was then renamed the goddard space flight center gsfc after dr robert h goddard its first 157 employees transferred from the united states navy s project vanguard missile program but continued their work at the naval research laboratory in washington d c while the center was under construction goddard space flight center contributed to project mercury america s first manned space flight program the center assumed a lead role for the project in its early days and managed the first 250 employees involved in the effort who were stationed at langley research center in hampton virginia however the size and scope of project mercury soon prompted nasa to build a new manned spacecraft center now the johnson space center in houston texas project mercury s personnel and activities were transferred there in 1961 the goddard network stdn tracked many early manned and unmanned spacecraft goddard space flight center remained involved in the manned space flight program providing computer support and radar tracking of flights through a worldwide network of ground stations called the spacecraft tracking and data acquisition network stdn however the center focused primarily on designing unmanned satellites and spacecraft for scientific research missions goddard pioneered several fields of spacecraft development including modular spacecraft design which reduced costs and made it possible to repair satellites in orbit goddard s solar max satellite launched in 1980 was repaired by astronauts on the space shuttle challenger in 1984 the hubble space telescope launched in 1990 remains in service and continues to grow in capability thanks to its modular design and multiple servicing missions by the space shuttle today the center remains involved in each of nasa s key programs goddard has developed more instruments for planetary exploration than any other organization among them scientific instruments sent to every planet in the solar system 2 the center s contribution to the earth science enterprise includes several spacecraft in the earth observing system fleet as well as eosdis a science data collection processing and distribution system for the manned space flight program goddard develops tools for use by astronauts during extra-vehicular activity and operates the lunar reconnaissance orbiter a spacecraft designed to study the moon in

challenging scientific and engineering work missions edit james webb space telescope mirrors assembled may 2016 a fact sheet highlighting many of goddard s previous missions are recorded on a 40th anniversary webpage 10 past edit goddard has been involved in designing building and operating spacecraft since the days of explorer 1 the nation s first artificial satellite the list of these missions reflects a diverse set of scientific objectives and goals the landsat series of spacecraft has been studying the earth s resources since the launch of the first mission in 1972 tiros-1 launched in 1960 as the first success in a long series of weather satellites the spartan platform deployed from the space shuttle allowing simple low-cost 2-3 day missions the second of nasa s great observatories the compton gamma ray observatory operated for nine years before re-entering the earth s atmosphere in 2000 another of goddard s space science observatories the cosmic background explorer provided unique scientific data about the early universe 11 present edit goddard currently supports the operation of dozens of spacecraft collecting scientific data these missions include earth science projects like the earth observing system eos that includes the terra aqua and aura spacecraft flying alongside several projects from other centers or other countries other major earth science projects that are currently operating include the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the global precipitation measurement mission gpm missions that provide data critical to hurricane predictions many goddard projects support other organizations such as the us geological survey on landsat-7 and -8 and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa on the geostationary operational environmental satellite goes system that provide weather predictions other goddard missions support a variety of space science disciplines goddard s most famous project is the hubble space telescope a unique science platform that has been breaking new ground in astronomy for nearly 20 years other missions such as the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe wmap study the structure and evolution of the universe other missions such as the solar and heliospheric observatory soho are currently studying the sun and how its behavior affects life on the earth the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro is mapping out the composition and topography of the moon and the solar dynamics observatory sdo is tracking the sun s energy and influence on the earth future edit the goddard community continually works on numerous operations and projects that have launch dates ranging from the upcoming year to a decade down the road these operations also vary in what scientists hope they will uncover particularly noteworthy operations include the james webb space telescope which will try to study the history of the universe 12 science edit play media in this video two goddard technologists explain what innovation means and why it is so important to nasa addressing scientific questions nasa s missions and therefore goddard s missions address a broad range of scientific questions generally classified around four key areas earth sciences astrophysics heliophysics and the solar system 13 to simplify goddard studies earth and space 14 within the earth sciences area goddard plays a major role in research to advance our understanding of the earth as an environmental system looking at questions related to how the components of that environmental system have developed how they interact and how they evolve this is all important to enable scientists to understand the practical impacts of natural and human activities during the coming decades and centuries within space sciences goddard has distinguished itself with the 2006 nobel physics prize given to john mather and the cobe mission beyond the cobe mission goddard studies how the universe formed what it is made of how its components interact and how it evolves the center also contributes to research seeking to understand how stars and planetary systems form and evolve and studies the nature of the sun s interaction with its surroundings from scientific questions to science missions based on existing knowledge accumulated through previous missions new science questions are articulated missions are developed in the same way an experiment would be developed using the scientific method in this context goddard does not work as an independent entity but rather as one of the 10 nasa centers working together to find answers to these scientific questions each mission starts with a set of scientific questions to be answered a set of scientific requirements for the mission which build on what has already been discovered by prior missions scientific requirements spell out the types data that will need to be collected these scientific requirements are then transformed into mission concepts that start to specify the kind of spacecraft and scientific instruments need to be developed for these scientific questions to be answered within goddard the sciences and exploration directorate sed leads the center s scientific endeavors including the development of technology related to scientific pursuits collecting data in space scientific instruments some of the most important technological advances developed by goddard and nasa in general come from the need to innovate with new scientific instruments in order to be able to observe or measure phenomena in space that have never been measured or observed before instrument names tend to be known by their initials in some cases the mission s name gives an indication of the type of instrument involved for example the james webb space telescope is as its name indicates a telescope but it includes a suite of four distinct scientific instruments mid-infrared instrument miri near-infrared camera nircam near-infrared spectrograph nirspec fine guidance sensor near-infrared imager and slitless spectrograph fgs-niriss 15 scientists at goddard work closely with the engineers to develop these instruments typically a mission consists of a spacecraft with an instrument suite multiple instruments on board in some cases the scientific requirements dictate the need for multiple spacecraft for example the magnetospheric multiscale mission mms studies magnetic reconnection a 3-d process in order to capture data about this complex 3-d process a set of four spacecraft fly in a tetrahedral formation each of the four spacecraft carries identical instrument suites mms is part of a larger program solar terrestrial probes that studies the impact of the sun on the solar system goddard s scientific collaborations in many cases goddard works with partners us government agencies aerospace industry university-based research centers other countries that are responsible for developing the scientific instruments in other cases goddard develops one or more of the instruments the individual instruments are then integrated into an instrument suite which is then integrated with the spacecraft in the case of mms for example southwest research institute swri was responsible for developing the scientific instruments and goddard provides overall project management mission systems engineering the spacecraft and mission operations 16 on the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro six instruments have been developed by a range of partners one of the instruments the lunar orbiter laser altimeter lola was developed by goddard lola measures landing site slopes and lunar surface roughness in order to generate a 3-d map of the moon 17 another mission to be managed by goddard is maven maven is the second mission within the mars scout program that is exploring the atmosphere of mars in support of nasa s broader efforts to go to mars maven carries eight instruments to measure characteristics of mars atmospheric gases upper atmosphere solar wind and ionosphere instrument development partners include the university of colorado at boulder and the university of california berkeley goddard contributed overall project management as well as two of the instruments two magnetometers managing scientific data once a mission is launched and reaches its destination its instruments start collecting data the data is transmitted back to earth where it needs to be analyzed and stored for future reference goddard manages large collections of scientific data resulting from past and ongoing missions the earth science division hosts the goddard earth science data and information services division ges disc 18 it offers earth science data information and services to research scientists applications scientists applications users and students the national space science data center nssdc created at goddard in 1966 hosts a permanent archive of space science data including a large collection of images from space spinoff technologies edit section 102 d of the national aeronautics and space act of 1958 calls for the establishment of long-range studies of the potential benefits to be gained from the opportunities for and the problems involved in the utilization of aeronautical and space activities for peaceful and scientific purposes 19 because of this mandate the technology utilization program was established in 1962 which required technologies to be brought down to earth and commercialized in order to help the us economy and improve the quality of life 20 documentation of these technologies that were spun off started in 1976 with spinoff 1976 21 since then nasa has produced a yearly publication of these spinoff technologies through the innovative partnerships program office goddard space flight center has made significant contributions to the us economy and quality of life with the technologies it has spun off here are some examples weather balloon technology has helped firefighters with its short-range radios aluminized mylar in satellites has made sports equipment more insulated laser optics systems have transformed the camera industry and life detection missions on other planets help scientists find bacteria in contaminated food 22 community edit the goddard space flight center maintains ties with local area communities through external volunteer and educational programs employees are encouraged to take part in mentoring programs and take on speaking roles at area schools on center goddard hosts regular colloquiums in engineering leadership and science these events are open to the general public but attendees must sign up in advance to procure a visitors pass for access to the center s main grounds passes can be obtained at the security office main gate on greenbelt road goddard also hosts several different internship opportunities including nasa develop at goddard space flight center queen elizabeth ii s visit edit queen elizabeth
