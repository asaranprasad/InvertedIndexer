cauchy v t in physics the angular velocity of a particle is the time rate of change of its angular displacement relative to the origin the si unit of angular velocity is radians per second angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega sometimes in three dimensions the angular velocity of a particle can be represented as a vector with its direction pointing perpendicular to both

edit the angular velocity of the particle at p with respect to the origin o is determined by the perpendicular component of the velocity vector v the angular velocity describes the rate of change of the angular position and the orientation of the instantaneous plane of angular displacement if the particle is revolving about the origin then the direction of the angular velocity pseudovector will be along the axis of rotation in this case counter-clockwise rotation the vector points up the angular velocity of a particle is measured relative to a point called the origin as shown in the diagram with angles and in radians if a line is drawn from the origin o to the particle p then the velocity v of the particle has a component along the radius radial component v and a component perpendicular to the radius cross-radial component v if there is no radial component then the particle moves tangent to a circle centered about the origin on the other hand if there is no cross-radial component then the particle moves tangent to a straight line that passes through the origin a radial motion produces no change in the direction of the particle relative to the origin so for the purpose of finding the angular velocity the radial component can be ignored therefore only the cross-radial tangential component of the velocity contributes to the angular velocity in two dimensions the angular velocity is given by d d t displaystyle omega frac d phi dt this is related to the cross-radial velocity by 1 v r d d t displaystyle mathrm v perp r frac d phi dt an explicit formula for v in terms of v and is v v sin displaystyle mathrm v perp mathrm mathbf v sin theta combining the above equations gives a formula for v sin r displaystyle omega frac mathrm mathbf v sin theta mathrm mathbf r in two dimensions the angular velocity is a single number with an orientation but no vectorial direction in other words in two dimensions it is a pseudoscalar a quantity that changes its sign under a parity inversion for example if one of the axes is inverted or if axes are swapped the direction of angular velocity is taken by convention to be positive if the position vector turns counterclockwise and negative if the position vector turns clockwise if the parity is inverted but the orientation of the angular displacement is not then the sign of the angular velocity changes particle in three dimensions edit in three-dimensional space angular velocity is a pseudovector quantity that specifies the rate at which the position vector sweeps out angle as well as the orientation of the plane of angular displacement angular velocity in three dimensions has a magnitude and a direction the right-hand rule indicates the positive direction of the angular velocity pseudovector let u displaystyle mathbf u be a unitary vector perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement so that from the top of the vector the angular displacement is counter-clock-wise the angular velocity vector displaystyle vec omega is then defined as d d t u displaystyle boldsymbol omega frac d phi dt mathbf u just as in the two dimensional case a particle will have a component of its velocity along the radius from the origin to the particle and another component perpendicular to that radius the combination of the origin point and the perpendicular component of the velocity defines a plane of angular displacement in which the behavior of the particle for that instant appears just as it does in the two dimensional case the direction normal to this plane is defined to be the direction of the angular velocity pseudovector while the magnitude is the same as the pseudoscalar value found in the 2-dimensional case using the unit vector u displaystyle mathbf u defined before the angular velocity vector may be written in a manner similar to that for two dimensions v sin r u displaystyle boldsymbol omega frac mathbf v sin theta mathbf r mathbf u which by the definition of the cross product can be written r v r 2 displaystyle boldsymbol omega frac mathbf r times mathbf v mathbf r 2 and using this vector it can be seen that the formula for the tangential velocity of the particle is v r displaystyle boldsymbol v perp boldsymbol omega times boldsymbol r addition of angular velocity vectors edit angular velocity can be defined as angular displacement per unit time if a point rotates with 2 displaystyle omega 2 in a frame f 2 displaystyle f 2 that itself rotates with an angular velocity 1 displaystyle omega 1 with respect to an external frame f 1 displaystyle f 1 we can define the addition of 1 2 displaystyle omega 1 omega 2 as the angular velocity vector of the point with respect to f 1 displaystyle f 1 with this operation defined like this angular velocity which is a pseudovector also becomes a real vector because it has two operations an internal operation addition which is associative commutative distributive and with zero and unity elements an external operation external product with the normal properties for an external product this is the definition of a vector space the only property that presents difficulties to prove is the commutativity of the addition this can be proven from the fact that the velocity tensor w see below is skew-symmetric therefore r e w t displaystyle r e wt is a rotation matrix and in a time dt is an infinitesimal rotation matrix therefore it can be expanded as r i w d t 1 2 w d t 2 displaystyle r i w cdot dt 1 over 2 w cdot dt 2 ldots the composition of rotations is not commutative but when the rotations are infinitesimal the first order approximation of the previous series can be taken and i w 1 d t i w 2 d t i w 2 d t i w 1 d t displaystyle i w 1 cdot dt i w 2 cdot dt i w 2 cdot dt i w 1 cdot dt and therefore 1 2 2 1 displaystyle omega 1 omega 2 omega 2 omega 1 angular velocity vector for a frame edit schematic construction for addition of angular velocity vectors for rotating frames given a rotating frame composed by three unitary vectors all the three must have the same angular speed in any instant in such a frame each vector is a particular case of the previous case moving particle in which the module of the vector is constant though it just a particular case of a moving particle this is a very important one for its relationship with the rigid body study and special tools have been developed for this case there are two possible ways to describe the angular velocity of a rotating frame the angular velocity vector and the angular velocity tensor both entities are related and they can be calculated from each other in a consistent way with the general definition the angular velocity of a frame is defined as the angular velocity of each of the three vectors of the frame it will be the same for any of them the addition of angular velocity vectors for frames is also defined by movement composition and can be useful to decompose the movement as in a gimbal components of the vector can be calculated as derivatives of the parameters defining the moving frames euler angles or rotation matrices as in the general case addition is commutative 1 2 2 1 displaystyle omega 1 omega 2 omega 2 omega 1 it is known by euler s rotation theorem that for any rotating frame there always exists an instantaneous axis of rotation in any instant in the case of a frame the angular velocity vector is over the instantaneous axis of rotation any transversal section of a plane perpendicular to this axis has to behave as a two dimensional rotation thus the magnitude of the angular velocity vector at a given time t is consistent with the two dimensions case components from the vectors of the frame edit substituting in the expression r v r 2 displaystyle boldsymbol omega frac mathbf r times mathbf v mathrm mathbf r 2 any unitary vector e of the frame we obtain e e e 2 displaystyle boldsymbol omega frac boldsymbol e times dot boldsymbol e mathbf e 2 and therefore e 1 e 1 e 2 e 2 e 3 e 3 displaystyle boldsymbol omega mathbf e 1 times dot mathbf e 1 mathbf e 2 times dot mathbf e 2 mathbf e 3 times dot mathbf e 3 as the columns of the matrix of the frame are the components of its vectors this allows also the calculation of displaystyle omega from the matrix of the frame and its derivative components from euler angles edit diagram showing euler frame in green the components of the angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by leonhard euler using his euler angles and an intermediate frame made out of the intermediate frames of the construction one axis of the reference frame the precession axis the line of nodes of the moving frame respect the reference frame nutation axis one axis of the moving frame the intrinsic rotation axis euler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector over these three axes was the derivative of its associated angle which is equivalent to decomposing the instant rotation in three instantaneous euler rotations therefore 2 u 1 u 2 u 3 displaystyle boldsymbol omega dot alpha mathbf u 1 dot beta mathbf u 2 dot gamma mathbf u 3 this basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases for example changing to the mobile frame sin sin cos i sin cos sin j cos k displaystyle boldsymbol omega dot alpha sin beta sin gamma dot beta cos gamma mathbf i dot alpha sin beta cos gamma - dot beta sin gamma mathbf j dot alpha cos beta dot gamma mathbf k where i j k displaystyle mathbf i mathbf j mathbf k are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body this example has been made using the z-x-z convention for euler angles 3 angular velocity tensor edit a similar way to describe the angular speed for a rotating frame is the angular velocity tensor it can be introduced from rotation matrices any vector r displaystyle vec r that rotates around an axis with an angular speed vector displaystyle vec omega as defined before satisfies d r t d t r displaystyle frac d vec r t dt vec omega times vec r we can introduce here the angular velocity tensor associated to the angular speed displaystyle omega w t 0 z t y t z t 0 x t y t x t 0 displaystyle w t begin pmatrix 0 - omega z t omega y t omega z t 0 - omega x t - omega y t omega x t 0 end pmatrix notice that this is an infinitesimal angular displacement divided by an infinitesimal time this tensor w t will act as if it were a displaystyle vec omega times operator t r t w t r t displaystyle vec omega t times vec r t w t vec r t calculation from the orientation matrix edit given the orientation matrix a t of a frame defined for all t and derivable we can obtain its instant angular velocity tensor w as follows we know that d r t d t w r displaystyle frac d vec r t dt w cdot vec r as angular speed must be the same for the three vectors of a rotating frame if we have a matrix a t whose columns are the vectors of the frame we can write for the three vectors as a whole d a t d t w a t displaystyle frac da t dt w cdot a t and therefore the angular velocity tensor we are looking for is w d a t d t a 1 t displaystyle w frac da t dt cdot a -1 t properties of angular velocity tensors edit in general the angular velocity in an n-dimensional space is the time derivative of the angular displacement tensor which is a second rank skew-symmetric tensor this tensor w will have n n 1 2 independent components and this number is the dimension of the lie algebra of the lie group of rotations of an n-dimensional inner product space 4 duality with respect to the velocity vector edit in three dimensions angular velocity can be represented by a pseudovector because second rank tensors are dual to pseudovectors in three dimensions notice that the tensor is a matrix with this structure w t 0 z t y t z t 0 x t y t x t 0 displaystyle w t begin pmatrix 0 - omega z t omega y t omega z t 0 - omega x t - omega y t omega x t 0 end pmatrix as it is a skew symmetric matrix it has a hodge dual that is a vector which is precisely the previous angular velocity vector displaystyle vec omega x y z displaystyle boldsymbol omega omega x omega y omega z exponential of w edit if we know an initial frame a 0 and we are given a constant angular velocity tensor w we can obtain a t for any given t since d a t d t w a t displaystyle frac da t dt w cdot a t this can be read as a differential equation that defines a t knowing w t d a t a w d t displaystyle frac da t a w cdot dt and if the angular speed is constant then w is also constant and the equation can be integrated the result is a t e w t a 0 displaystyle a t e w cdot t a 0 which shows a connection with the lie group of rotations w is skew-symmetric edit it is possible to prove that angular velocity tensor are skew symmetric matrices which means that a w d r t d t r t displaystyle w frac dr t dt cdot r text t satisfies w t w displaystyle w text t -w to prove it we start taking the time derivative of r r t displaystyle mathcal r mathcal r text t being r t a rotation matrix i r r t displaystyle mathcal i mathcal r mathcal r text t because r t is a rotation matrix 0 d r d t r t r d r t d t displaystyle 0 frac d mathcal r dt mathcal r text t mathcal r frac d mathcal r text t dt applying the formula ab t btat 0 d r d t r t d r d t r t t w w t displaystyle 0 frac d mathcal r dt mathcal r text t left frac d mathcal r dt mathcal r text t right text t w w text t thus w is the negative of its transpose which implies it is a skew symmetric matrix coordinate-free description edit at any instant t displaystyle t the angular velocity tensor represents a linear map between the position vectors r t displaystyle mathbf r t and their velocity vectors v t displaystyle mathbf v t of a rigid body rotating around the origin v w r displaystyle mathbf v w mathbf r where we omitted the t displaystyle t parameter and regard v displaystyle mathbf v and r displaystyle mathbf r as elements of the same 3-dimensional euclidean vector space v displaystyle v the relation between this linear map and the angular velocity pseudovector displaystyle omega is the following because of w is the derivative of an orthogonal transformation the b r s w r s displaystyle b mathbf r mathbf s w mathbf r cdot mathbf s bilinear form is skew-symmetric here displaystyle cdot stands for the scalar product so we can apply the fact of exterior algebra that there is a unique linear form l displaystyle l on 2 v displaystyle lambda 2 v that l r s b r s displaystyle l mathbf r wedge mathbf s b mathbf r mathbf s where r s 2 v displaystyle mathbf r wedge mathbf s in lambda 2 v is the exterior product of r displaystyle mathbf r and s displaystyle mathbf s taking the sharp l of l we get w r s l r s displaystyle w mathbf r cdot mathbf s l sharp cdot mathbf r wedge mathbf s introducing l displaystyle omega star l sharp as the hodge dual of l and applying the definition of the hodge dual twice supposing that the preferred unit 3-vector is 1 displaystyle star 1 w r s l r s r s r s r s displaystyle w mathbf r cdot mathbf s star star l sharp wedge mathbf r wedge mathbf s star omega wedge mathbf r wedge mathbf s star omega wedge mathbf r cdot mathbf s omega times mathbf r cdot mathbf s where r r displaystyle omega times mathbf r star omega wedge mathbf r by definition because s displaystyle mathbf s is an arbitrary vector from nondegeneracy of scalar product follows w r r displaystyle w mathbf r omega times mathbf r angular velocity as a vector field edit for angular velocity tensor maps velocities to positions it is a vector field in particular this vector field is a killing vector field belonging to an element of the lie algebra so 3 of the 3-dimensional rotation group so 3 this element of so 3 can also be regarded as the angular velocity vector rigid body considerations edit position of point p located in the rigid body shown in blue r i is the position with respect to the lab frame centered at o and r i is the position with respect to the rigid body frame centered at o the origin of the rigid body frame is at vector position r from the lab frame the same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating rigid body here is not assumed that the rigid body rotates around the origin instead it can be supposed rotating around an arbitrary point that is moving with a linear velocity v t in each instant to obtain the equations it is convenient to imagine a rigid body attached to the frames and consider a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the rigid body then we will study the coordinate transformations between this coordinate and the fixed laboratory system as shown in the figure on the right the lab system s origin is at point o the rigid body system origin is at o and the vector from o to o is r a particle i in the rigid body is located at point p and the vector position of this particle is ri in the lab frame and at position ri in the body frame it is seen that the position of the particle can be written r i r r i displaystyle mathbf r i mathbf r mathbf r i the defining characteristic of a rigid body is that the distance between any two points in a rigid body is unchanging in time this means that the length of the vector r i displaystyle mathbf r i is unchanging by euler s rotation theorem we may replace the vector r i displaystyle mathbf r i with r r i o displaystyle mathcal r mathbf r io where r displaystyle mathcal r is a 3 3 rotation matrix and r i o displaystyle mathbf r io is the position of the particle at some fixed point in time say t 0 this replacement is useful because now it is only the rotation matrix r displaystyle mathcal r that is changing in time and not the reference vector r i o displaystyle mathbf r io as the rigid body rotates about point o also since the three columns of the rotation matrix represent the three versors of a reference frame rotating together with the rigid body any rotation about any axis becomes now visible while the vector r i displaystyle mathbf r i would not rotate if the rotation axis were parallel to it and hence it would only describe a rotation about an axis perpendicular to it i e it would not see the component of the angular velocity pseudovector parallel to it and would only allow the computation of the component perpendicular to it the position of the particle is now written as r i r r r i o displaystyle mathbf r i mathbf r mathcal r mathbf r io taking the time derivative yields the velocity of the particle v i v d r d t r i o displaystyle mathbf v i mathbf v frac d mathcal r dt mathbf r io where vi is the velocity of the particle in the lab frame and v is the velocity of o the origin of the rigid body frame since r displaystyle mathcal r is a rotation matrix its inverse is its transpose so we substitute i r t r displaystyle mathcal i mathcal r text t mathcal r v i v d r d t i r i o displaystyle mathbf v i mathbf v frac d mathcal r dt mathcal i mathbf r io v i v d r d t r t r r i o displaystyle mathbf v i mathbf v frac d mathcal r dt mathcal r text t mathcal r mathbf r io v i v d r d t r t r i displaystyle mathbf v i mathbf v frac d mathcal r dt mathcal r text t mathbf r i or v i v w r i displaystyle mathbf v i mathbf v w mathbf r i where w d r d t r t displaystyle w frac d mathcal r dt mathcal r text t is the previous angular velocity tensor it can be proved that this is a skew symmetric matrix so we can take its dual to get a 3 dimensional pseudovector that is precisely the previous angular velocity vector displaystyle vec omega x y z displaystyle boldsymbol omega omega x omega y omega z substituting for w into the above velocity expression and replacing matrix multiplication by an equivalent cross product v i v r i displaystyle mathbf v i mathbf v boldsymbol omega times mathbf r i it can be seen that the velocity of a point in a rigid body can be divided into two terms the velocity of a reference point fixed in the rigid body plus the cross product term involving the angular velocity of the particle with respect to the reference point this angular velocity is the spin angular velocity of the rigid body as opposed to the angular velocity of the reference point o about the origin o consistency edit we have supposed that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary point we should prove that the angular velocity previously defined is independent from the choice of origin which means that the angular velocity is an intrinsic property of the spinning rigid body proving the independence of angular velocity from choice of origin see the graph to the right the origin of lab frame is o while o1 and o2 are two fixed points on the rigid body whose velocity is v 1 displaystyle mathbf v 1 and v 2 displaystyle mathbf v 2 respectively suppose the angular velocity with respect to o1 and o2 is 1 displaystyle boldsymbol omega 1 and 2 displaystyle boldsymbol omega 2 respectively since point p and o2 have only one velocity v 1 1 r 1 v 2 2 r 2 displaystyle mathbf v 1 boldsymbol omega 1 times mathbf r 1 mathbf v 2 boldsymbol omega 2 times mathbf r 2 v 2 v 1 1 r v 1 1 r 1 r 2 displaystyle mathbf v 2 mathbf v 1 boldsymbol omega 1 times mathbf r mathbf v 1 boldsymbol omega 1 times mathbf r 1 - mathbf r 2 the above two yields that 1 2 r 2 0 displaystyle boldsymbol omega 1 - boldsymbol omega 2 times mathbf r 2 0 since the point p and thus r 2 displaystyle mathbf r 2 is arbitrary it follows that 1 2 displaystyle boldsymbol omega 1 boldsymbol omega 2 if the reference point is the instantaneous axis of rotation the expression of velocity of a point in the rigid body will have just the angular velocity term this is because the velocity of instantaneous axis of rotation is zero an example of instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge of a door another example is the point of contact
