thermal reservoir - wikipedia thermal reservoir from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from heat reservoir jump to navigation search a thermal reservoir a short-form of thermal energy reservoir or thermal bath is a thermodynamic system with a heat capacity that is large enough that when it is in thermal contact with another system of interest or its environment its temperature remains effectively constant 1 it is an effectively infinite pool of thermal energy at a given constant temperature the temperature of the reservoir does not change when heat is added or extracted because of the infinite heat capacity as it can act as a source and sink of heat it is often also referred to as a heat reservoir or heat bath lakes oceans and rivers often serve as thermal reservoirs in geophysical processes such as the weather in atmospheric science large air masses in the atmosphere often function as thermal reservoirs the microcanonical partition sum z e displaystyle z e of a heat bath of temperature t displaystyle t has the property z e e z e e e k b t displaystyle z e delta e z e e delta e k b t where k b displaystyle k b is boltzmann s constant it thus changes by the same factor when a given amount of energy is added the exponential factor in this expression can be identified with the reciprocal of the boltzmann factor references edit c yunus a boles michael a 2002 thermodynamics an engineering approach boston mcgraw-hill p 247 isbn 0-07-121688-x retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title thermal reservoir oldid 735221424 categories thermodynamics navigation menu search this page was last edited on 19 august 2016 at 09 42 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
