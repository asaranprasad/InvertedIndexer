juan capistrano they have built their mud nests in the eaves of the vellano country club situated around a golf course in the chino hills just north of the chino hills state park mission san juan capistrano officials state it is because the mission is no longer the tallest building in the area due to urban sprawl and has thus stopped attracting the swallows for nesting 21 education edit san

public high school ultimately nearly all san juan capistrano s high school students will move to this campus as well as some students from capistrano beach san clemente high school and southern ladera ranch residents from these other communities did not want to attend a school in san juan on the basis that it was farther than the current schools they were attending and that the communities had too many differences many residents wanted to stay at the established high schools their communities had been attending for years much of the tension has died down but there is still substantial resentment that children of residents in capistrano beach who have historically attended san clemente high school should be compelled to take the long journey to the new high school these residents contend the county of orange should follow its original long range plan and complete la pata parkway through to san clemente which would permit students in the talega subdivision to attend the school which was built and intended for their use and redirect those students away from san clemente high school this city also has four private christian college prep schools named capistrano valley
