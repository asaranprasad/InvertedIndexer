wave in plasma physics an alfv n wave named after hannes alfv n is a type of magnetohydrodynamic wave in which ions oscillate in response to a restoring force provided by an effective tension on the magnetic field lines 1 contents 1 definition 2 alfv n velocity 3 alfv n time 4 relativistic case 5 heating the corona 6 history 7 see also 8 references 9 further reading 10 external links definition edit an alfv n wave in a plasma is a low-frequency compared to the ion cyclotron frequency travelling oscillation of the ions and the magnetic field the ion mass density provides the inertia and the magnetic field line tension provides the restoring force the wave propagates in the direction of the magnetic field although waves exist at oblique incidence and smoothly change into the magnetosonic wave when the propagation is perpendicular to the magnetic field the motion of the ions and the perturbation of the magnetic field are in the same direction and transverse to the direction of propagation the wave is dispersionless alfv n velocity edit this section does not cite any sources please help by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed

n s m s is the total mass density of the charged plasma particles here s displaystyle s goes over all plasma species both electrons and few types of ions therefore the phase velocity of an

then v c displaystyle v approx c that is at high field or low density the velocity of the alfv n wave approaches the speed of light and the alfv n wave becomes an ordinary electromagnetic wave

non-relativistic limit p e c 2 displaystyle p ll e approx rho c 2 and we immediately get the expression from the previous section heating the corona edit cold plasma floating in the corona above the solar limb alfv n waves were observed for the first time extrapolated from fluctuations of the plasma the coronal heating problem is a longstanding question in heliophysics it is unknown why the sun s corona lives in a temperature range higher than one million degrees while the sun s surface photosphere is only a few thousand degrees in temperature natural intuition would predict a decrease in temperature while getting farther away from a heat source but it is theorized that the photosphere influenced by the sun s magnetic fields emits certain waves which carry energy i e heat to the corona and solar wind it is important to note that because the density of the corona is quite a bit smaller than the photosphere the heat and energy level of the photosphere is much higher than the corona temperature depends only on the average speed of a species and less energy is required to heat fewer particles to higher temperatures in the coronal atmosphere alfv n first proposed the existence of an electromagnetic-hydrodynamic wave in 1942 in journal nature he claimed the sun had all necessary criteria to support these waves and that they may in turn be responsible for sun spots from his paper magnetic waves called alfv n s-waves flow from the base of black hole jets if a conducting liquid is placed in a constant magnetic field every motion of the liquid gives rise to an e m f which produces electric currents owing to the magnetic field these currents give mechanical forces which change the state of motion of the liquid thus a kind of combined electromagnetic-hydrodynamic wave is produced hannes alfv n existence of electromagnetic-hydrodynamic waves 3 beneath the sun s photosphere lies the convection zone the rotation of the sun as well as varying pressure gradients beneath the surface produces the periodic electromagnetism in the convection zone which can be observed on the sun s surface this random motion of the surface gives rise to alfv n waves the waves travel through the chromosphere and transition zone and interact with much of the ionized plasma the wave itself carries energy as well as some of the electrically charged plasma de pontieu 4 and haerendel 5 suggested in the early 1990s that alfven waves may also be associated with the plasma jets known as spicules it was theorized these brief spurts of superheated gas were carried by the combined energy and momentum of their own upward velocity as well as the oscillating transverse motion of the alfven waves in 2007 alfven waves were reportedly observed for the first time traveling towards the corona by tomcyzk et al but their predictions could not conclude that the energy carried by the alfven waves were sufficient to heat the corona to its enormous temperatures for the observed amplitudes of the waves were not high enough 6 however in 2011 mcintosh et al reported the observation of highly energetic alfven waves combined with energetic spicules which could sustain heating the corona to its million kelvin temperature these observed amplitudes 20.0 km s against 2007 s observed 0.5 km s contained over one hundred times more energy than the ones observed in 2007 7 the short period of the waves also allowed more energy transfer into the coronal atmosphere the 50,000 km long spicules may also play a part in accelerating the solar wind past the corona 8 however the above-mentioned discoveries of alfv n waves in the complex sun s atmosphere starting from hinode era in 2007 for next 10 years mostly fall in the realm of alfv nic waves essentially generated as a mixed mode due to transverse structuring of the magnetic and plasma properties in the localized fluxtubes in 2009 david jess from queens university belfast and colleagues have reported the periodic variation of h-alpha line-width as observed by swedish solar telescope sst above chromospheric bright-points they claimed first direct detection of the long-period 126-700 s incompressible torsional alfv n waves in the lower solar atmosphere in 2017 abhishek kumar srivastava from iit bhu india and colleagues have detected the existence of high-frequency torsional alfv n waves in the sun s chromospheric fine structured fluxtubes they discovered that these high-frequency waves carry substantial energy capable of heating the sun s corona and also in originating the supersonic solar wind history edit how

solar coronal loops observed with the euv imager on board the transition region and coronal explorer trace interpreted as standing kink or alfv nic oscillations of the loops this fulfilled the prediction of roberts et al 1984 2007 tomczyk et al report the detection of alfv nic waves in images of the solar corona with the coronal multi-channel polarimeter comp instrument at the national solar observatory new mexico these waves were interpreted as propagating kink waves by van doorsselaere et al 2008 2007 alfv n wave discoveries appear in articles by jonathan cirtain and colleagues takenori j okamoto and colleagues and bart de pontieu and colleagues de pontieu s team proposed that the energy associated with the waves is sufficient to heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind these results appear in a special collection of 10 articles by scientists in japan europe and the united states in the 7 december issue of the journal science it was demonstrated that those waves should be interpreted in terms of kink waves of coronal plasma structures by van doorsselaere et al 2008 ofman and wang 2008 and vasheghani farahani et al 2009 2008 kaghashvili et al proposed how the
