completed in the spring of 1897 making the new settlement the regional transport hub the importance of the city further increased with the completion of the turkestan-siberia railway in the early 20th century the new railway connected novonikolayevsk to central asia and the caspian sea 21 at the time of the bridge s opening novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people the frontier settlement developed rapidly its first bank opened in 1906 and a total of five banks were operating by 1915 in 1907 novonikolayevsk now with a population exceeding 47,000 was granted town status with full rights for self-government during the pre-revolutionary period the population of novonikolayevsk reached 80,000 the city had steady and rapid economic growth becoming one of the largest commercial and

secondary school in 1913 novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in russia to institute compulsory primary education 21 the russian civil war took a toll on the city there were wartime

novonikolayevsk began to decline the soviet workers and soldiers deputies of novonikolayevsk took control of the city in december 1917 in may 1918 the czechoslovak legions rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and together with the white guards captured novonikolayevsk the red army took the city in 1919 retaining it throughout the rest of the civil war 21 novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of lenin s new economic policy period it was a part of tomsk governorate and served as its administrative center from december 23 1919 to march 14 1920 citation

industrial centers of siberia several massive industrial facilities were created including the sibkombain plant specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment additionally a metal processing plant a food processing plant and other industrial enterprises and factories were built as well as a new power station the great soviet famine of 1932-1933 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in novosibirsk they were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city giving rise to slums such as bolshaya nakhalovka malaya nakhalovka and others 21 its rapid growth and industrialization led to novosibirsk being nicknamed the chicago of siberia 24 tram rails were laid down in 1934 by which time the population had reached 287,000 making novosibirsk the largest city in siberia the following year the original bridge over the ob river was replaced by the new kommunalny bridge 21 between 1940 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western russia to novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war and at this time the city became a major supply base for the red army during this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees the rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts 25 necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir now known as the ob sea as a direct result of the station s construction vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area additionally the new open space created by the reservoir s surface caused average wind speeds to double increasing the rate of soil erosion 21 in the 1950s the soviet government directed that a center for scientific research be built in novosibirsk and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of akademgorodok was constructed about 30 kilometers 19 mi south of the city center the siberian
