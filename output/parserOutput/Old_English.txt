english nglisc anglisc englisc or anglo-saxon 2 is the earliest historical form of the english language spoken in england and southern and eastern scotland in the early middle ages it was brought to great britain by anglo-saxon settlers probably in the mid-5th century and the first old english literary works date from the mid-7th century after the norman conquest of 1066 english was replaced for a time as the language of the upper classes by anglo-norman a relative of french this is regarded as marking the end of the old english era as during this period the english language was heavily influenced by anglo-norman developing into a phase known now as middle english old english developed from a set of anglo-frisian or ingvaeonic dialects originally spoken by germanic tribes traditionally known as the angles saxons and jutes as the anglo-saxons became dominant in england their language replaced the languages of roman britain common brittonic a celtic language and latin brought to britain by roman invasion old english had four main dialects associated with particular anglo-saxon kingdoms mercian northumbrian kentish and west saxon it was west saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later old english period 3 although the dominant forms of middle and modern english would develop mainly from mercian the speech of eastern and northern parts of england was subject to strong old norse influence due to scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century old english is one of the west germanic languages and its closest relatives are old frisian and old saxon like other old germanic languages it is very different from modern english and difficult for modern english speakers to understand without study old english grammar is quite similar to that of modern german nouns adjectives pronouns and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms and word order is much freer 3 the oldest old english inscriptions were written using a

terminology edit englisc which the term english is derived from means pertaining to the angles 4 in old english this word was derived from angles one of the germanic tribes who conquered parts of great britain in the 5th century 5 during the 9th century all invading germanic tribes were referred to as englisc it has been hypothesised that the angles acquired their name because their land on the coast of jutland now mainland denmark resembled a fishhook proto-germanic anguz also had the meaning of narrow referring to the shallow waters near the coast that word ultimately goes back to proto-indo-european h en - also meaning narrow 6 another theory is that the derivation of narrow is the more likely connection to angling as in fishing which itself stems from a pie root meaning bend angle 7 the semantic link is the fishing hook which is curved or bent at an angle 8 in any case the angles may have been called such because they were a fishing people or were originally descended from such and therefore england would mean land of the fishermen and english would be the fishermen s language 9 history edit the approximate extent of germanic languages in the early 10th century old

static and its usage covered a period of 700 years from the anglo-saxon settlement of britain in the 5th century to the late 11th century some time after the norman invasion while indicating that the establishment of dates is an arbitrary process albert baugh dates old english from 450 to 1150 a period of full inflections a synthetic language 3 perhaps around 85 per cent of old english words are no longer in use but those that survived are basic elements of modern english vocabulary 3 old english is a west germanic language developing out of ingvaeonic also known as north sea germanic dialects from the 5th century it came to be spoken over most of the territory of the anglo-saxon kingdoms which became the kingdom of england this included most of present-day england as well as part of what is now southeastern scotland which for several centuries belonged to the anglo-saxon kingdom of northumbria other parts of the island wales and most of scotland continued to use celtic languages except in the areas of scandinavian settlements where old norse was spoken celtic speech also remained established in certain parts of england medieval cornish was spoken all over cornwall and in adjacent parts of devon while cumbric survived perhaps to the 12th century in parts of cumbria and welsh may have been spoken on the english side of the anglo-welsh border norse was also widely spoken in the parts of england which fell under danish law anglo-saxon literacy developed after christianisation in the late 7th century the oldest surviving text of old english literature is c dmon s hymn composed between 658 and 680 3 there is a limited corpus of runic inscriptions from the 5th to 7th centuries but the oldest coherent runic texts notably the franks casket date to the 8th century the old english latin alphabet was introduced around the 9th century alfred the great statue in winchester hampshire the 9th-century english king proposed that primary education be taught in english with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in latin with the unification of the anglo-saxon kingdoms outside the danelaw by alfred the great in the later 9th century the language of government and literature became standardised around the west saxon dialect early west saxon alfred advocated education in english alongside latin and had many works translated into the english language some of them such as pope gregory i s treatise pastoral care appear to have been translated by alfred himself in old english typical of the development of literature poetry arose before prose but king alfred the great 871 to 901 chiefly inspired the growth of prose 3 a later literary standard dating from the later 10th century arose under the influence of bishop thelwold of winchester and was followed by such writers as the prolific lfric of eynsham the grammarian this form of the language is known as the winchester standard or more commonly as late west saxon it is considered to represent the classical form of old english 10 it retained its position of prestige until the time of the norman conquest after which english ceased for a time to be of importance as a literary language the history of old english can be subdivided into prehistoric old english c 450 to 650 for this period old english is mostly a reconstructed language as no literary witnesses survive with the exception of limited epigraphic evidence this language or bloc of languages spoken by the angles saxons and jutes and pre-dating documented old english or anglo-saxon has also been called primitive old english 11 early old english c 650 to 900 the period of the oldest manuscript traditions with authors such as c dmon bede cynewulf and aldhelm late old english c 900 to 1066 the final stage of the language leading up to the norman conquest of england and the subsequent transition to early middle english the old english period is followed by middle english 12th to 15th century early modern english c 1480 to 1650 and finally modern english after 1650 dialects edit her swutela seo gecwydr dnes e here is manifested the word to thee old english inscription over the arch of the south porticus in the 10th-century st mary s parish church breamore hampshire old english should not be regarded as a single monolithic entity just as modern english is also not monolithic it emerged over time out of the many dialects and languages of the colonising tribes and it is only towards the later anglo-saxon period that these can be considered to have constituted a single national language 12 even then old english continued to exhibit much local and regional variation remnants of which remain in modern english dialects 13 the four main dialectal forms of old english were mercian northumbrian kentish and west saxon 14 mercian and northumbrian are together referred to as anglian in terms of geography the northumbrian region lay north of the humber river the mercian lay north of the thames and south of the humber river west saxon lay south and southwest of the thames and the smallest kentish region lay southeast of the thames a small corner of england the kentish region settled by the jutes from jutland has the scantiest literary remains 3 each of these four dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island of these northumbria south of the tyne and most of mercia were overrun by the vikings during the 9th century the portion of mercia that was successfully defended and all of kent were then integrated into wessex under alfred the great from that time on the west saxon dialect then in the form now known as early west saxon became standardised as the language of government and as the basis for the many works of literature and religious materials produced or translated from latin in that period the later literary standard known as late west saxon see history above although centred in the same region of the country appears not to have been directly descended from alfred s early west saxon for example the former diphthong iy tended to become monophthongised to i in ews but to y in lws 15 due to the centralisation of power and the viking invasions there is relatively little written record of the non-wessex dialects after alfred s unification some mercian texts continued to be written however and the influence of mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under alfred s programme many of which were produced by mercian scholars 16 other dialects certainly continued to be spoken as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in middle and modern english in fact what would become the standard forms of middle english and of modern english are descended from mercian rather than west saxon while scots developed from the northumbrian dialect it was once claimed that owing to its position at the heart of the kingdom of wessex the relics of anglo-saxon accent idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the dialect of somerset 17 for details of the sound differences between the dialects see phonological history of old english dialects influence of other languages edit the language of the anglo-saxon settlers appears not to have been significantly affected by the native british celtic languages which it largely displaced the number of celtic loanwords introduced into the language is very small however various suggestions have been made concerning possible influence that celtic may have had on developments in english syntax in the post-old english period such as the regular progressive construction and analytic word order 18 as well as the eventual development of the periphrastic auxiliary verb do old english contained a certain number of loanwords from latin which was the scholarly and diplomatic lingua franca of western europe it is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone some latin words had already been borrowed into the germanic languages before the ancestral angles and saxons left continental europe for britain more entered the language when the anglo-saxons were converted to christianity and latin-speaking priests became influential it was also through irish christian missionaries that the latin alphabet was introduced and adapted for the writing of old english replacing the earlier runic system nonetheless the largest transfer of latin-based mainly old french words into english occurred after the norman conquest of 1066 and thus in the middle english rather than the old english period another source of loanwords was old norse which came into contact with old english via the scandinavian rulers and settlers in the danelaw from the late 9th century and during the rule of cnut and other danish kings in the early 11th century many place-names in eastern and northern england are of scandinavian origin norse borrowings are relatively rare in old english literature being mostly terms relating to government and administration the literary standard however was based on the west saxon dialect away from the main area of scandinavian influence the impact of norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects certainly in middle english texts which are more often based on eastern dialects a strong norse influence becomes apparent modern english contains a great many often everyday words that were borrowed from old norse and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the old english period is also often attributed to norse influence 3 19 20 the influence of old norse certainly helped move english from a synthetic language along the continuum to a more analytic word order and old norse most likely made a greater impact on the english language than any other language 3 21 the eagerness of vikings in the danelaw to communicate with their southern anglo-saxon neighbours produced a friction that led to the erosion of the complicated inflectional word-endings 20 22 23 simeon potter notes no less far-reaching was the influence of scandinavian upon the inflexional endings of english in hastening that wearing away and leveling of grammatical forms which gradually spread from north to south it was after all a salutary influence the gain was greater than the loss there was a gain in directness in clarity and in strength 24 the strength of the viking influence on old english appears from the fact that the indispensable elements of the language pronouns modals comparatives pronominal adverbs like hence and together conjunctions and prepositions show the most marked danish influence the best evidence of scandinavian influence appears in the extensive word borrowings for as jespersen indicates no texts exist in either scandinavia or in northern england from this time to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax the change to old english from old norse was substantive pervasive and of a democratic character 3 20 old norse and old english resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common they roughly understood each other 20 in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged 23 25 it is most important to recognize that in many words the english and scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements the body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding in the mixed population which existed in the danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost this blending of peoples and languages resulted in simplifying english grammar 3 phonology edit the inventory of classical old english late west saxon surface phones as usually reconstructed is as follows consonants labial dental alveolar post- alveolar palatal velar glottal nasal m n n stop p b t d k affricate t d fricative f v s z x h approximant l l j w trill r r the sounds enclosed in parentheses in the chart above are not considered to be phonemes d is an allophone of j occurring after n and when geminated doubled is an allophone of n occurring before k and v z are voiced allophones of f s respectively occurring between vowels or voiced consonants x are allophones of h occurring in coda position after front and back vowels respectively is an allophone of occurring after a vowel and at an earlier stage of the language in the syllable onset the voiceless sonorants l n r are analysed as realizing the sequences hw hl hn hr the above system is largely similar to that of modern english except that x l n r and for most speakers have generally been lost while the voiced affricate and fricatives now also including have become independent phonemes as has vowels monophthongs front back unrounded rounded unrounded rounded close i i y y u u mid e e o o open the mid front rounded vowels had merged into unrounded e before the late west saxon period during the 11th century such vowels arose again as monophthongisations of the

close diphthongs spelt ie is disputed it may have been i y or i e other dialects may have had different systems of diphthongs for example anglian dialects retained i u which had merged with e o in west saxon for more on dialectal differences see phonological history of old english dialects sound changes edit some of the principal sound changes occurring in the pre-history and history of old english were the following fronting of to except when nasalised or followed by a nasal consonant anglo-frisian brightening partly reversed in certain positions by later a-restoration or retraction monophthongisation of the diphthong ai and modification of remaining diphthongs to the height-harmonic type diphthongisation of long and short front vowels in certain positions breaking palatalisation of velars k sk to t d j in certain front-vowel environments the process known as i-mutation which for example led to modern mice as the plural of mouse loss of certain weak vowels in word-final and medial positions and of medial i j reduction of remaining unstressed vowels diphthongisation of certain vowels before certain consonants when preceding a back vowel back mutation loss of h between vowels or between a voiced consonant and a vowel with lengthening of the preceding vowel collapse of two consecutive vowels into a single vowel palatal umlaut which has given forms such as six compare german sechs for more details of these processes see the main article linked above for sound changes before and after the old english period see phonological history of english grammar edit morphology edit nouns decline for five cases nominative accusative genitive dative instrumental three genders masculine feminine neuter and two numbers singular and plural and are strong or weak the instrumental is vestigial and only used with the masculine and neuter singular and often replaced by the dative only pronouns and strong adjectives retain separate instrumental forms there is also sparse early northumbrian evidence of a sixth case the locative adjectives agree with nouns in case gender number and strong or weak forms pronouns and sometimes participles agree in case gender and number first-person and second-person personal pronouns occasionally distinguish dual-number forms the definite article s and its inflections serve as a definite article the a demonstrative adjective that and demonstrative pronoun other demonstratives are es this and eon yon these words inflect for case gender number adjectives have both strong and weak sets of endings weak ones being used when a definite or possessive determiner is also present verbs conjugate for three persons first second and third two numbers singular plural two tenses present and past three moods indicative subjunctive and imperative 27 and are strong exhibiting ablaut or weak exhibiting a dental suffix verbs have two infinitive forms bare and bound and two participles present and past the subjunctive has past and present forms finite verbs agree with subjects in person and number the future tense passive voice and other aspects are formed with compounds adpositions are mostly before but often after their object if the object of an adposition is marked in the dative case an adposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence remnants of the old english case system in modern english are in the forms of a few pronouns such as i me mine she her who whom whose and in the possessive ending - s which derives from the masculine and neuter genitive ending -es the modern english plural ending - e s derives from the old english -as but the latter applied only to strong masculine nouns in the nominative and accusative cases different plural endings were used in other instances old english nouns had grammatical gender while modern english has only natural gender pronoun usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender when those conflicted as in the case of w f a neuter noun referring to a female person in old english s verbal compound constructions are the beginnings of the compound tenses of modern english 28 old english verbs include strong verbs which form the past tense by altering the root vowel and weak verbs which use a suffix such as -de 27 as in modern english and peculiar to the germanic languages the verbs formed two great classes weak regular and strong irregular like today old english had fewer strong verbs and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms then as now dental suffixes indicated the past tense of the weak verbs as in work and worked 3 syntax edit old english syntax is similar to that of modern english some differences are consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection allowing freer word order default word order is verb-second in main clauses and verb-final in subordinate clauses being more like modern german than modern english no do-support in questions and negatives questions were usually formed by inverting subject and finite verb and negatives by placing ne before the finite verb regardless what verb multiple negatives can stack up in a sentence intensifying each other negative concord sentences with subordinate clauses of the type when x y e g when i got home i ate dinner don t use a wh-type conjunction but rather a th-type correlative conjunction such as otherwise meaning then e g x y in place of when x y the wh-words are used only as interrogatives and as indefinite pronouns similarly wh- forms were not used as relative pronouns instead the indeclinable word e is used often preceded by or replaced by the appropriate form of the article demonstrative se orthography edit the runic alphabet used to write old english before the introduction of the latin alphabet old english was first written in runes using the futhorc a rune set derived from the germanic 24-character elder futhark extended by five more runes used to represent anglo-saxon vowel sounds and sometimes by several more additional characters from around the 9th century the runic system came to be supplanted by a minuscule half-uncial script of the latin alphabet introduced by irish christian missionaries 29 this was replaced by insular script a cursive and pointed version of the half-uncial script this was used until the end of the 12th century when continental carolingian minuscule also known as caroline replaced the insular the latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters j and w and there was no v as distinct from u moreover native old english spellings did not use k q or z the remaining 20 latin letters were supplemented by four more sc modern ash and t now called eth or edh which were modified latin letters and thorn and wynn which are borrowings from the futhorc a few letter pairs were used as digraphs representing a single sound also used was the tironian note a character similar to the digit 7 for the conjunction and and a thorn with a crossbar through the ascender for the pronoun t macrons over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels as in modern editions but to indicate stress 30 or as abbreviations for a following m or n 31 modern editions of old english manuscripts generally introduce some additional conventions the modern forms of latin letters are used including g in place of the insular g s for long s and others which may differ considerably from the insular script notably e f and r macrons are used to indicate long vowels where usually no distinction was made between long and short vowels in the originals in some older editions an acute accent mark was used for consistency with old norse conventions additionally modern editions often distinguish between velar and palatal c and g by placing dots above the palatals the letter wynn is usually replaced with w but sc eth and thorn are normally retained except when eth is replaced by thorn in contrast with modern english orthography that of old english was reasonably regular with a mostly predictable correspondence between letters and phonemes there were not usually any silent letters in the word cniht for example both the c and h were pronounced unlike the k and gh in the modern knight the following table lists the old english letters and digraphs together with the phonemes they represent using the same notation as in the phonology section above

though more abundant than literature of the continent before ad 1000 citation needed is nonetheless scant the pagan and christian streams mingle in old english one of the richest and most significant bodies of literature preserved among the early germanic peoples 3 in his supplementary article to the 1935 posthumous edition of bright s anglo-saxon reader dr james hulbert writes in such historical conditions an incalculable amount of the writings of the anglo-saxon period perished what they contained how important they were for an understanding of literature before the conquest we have no means of knowing the scant catalogues of monastic libraries do not help us and there are no references in extant works to other compositions how incomplete our materials are can be illustrated by the well-known fact that with few and relatively unimportant exceptions all extant anglo-saxon poetry is preserved in four manuscripts some of the most important surviving works of old english literature are beowulf an epic poem the anglo-saxon chronicle a record of early english history the franks casket an inscribed early whalebone artefact and c dmon s hymn a christian religious poem there are also a number of extant prose works such as sermons and saints lives biblical translations and translated latin works of the early church fathers legal documents such as laws and wills and practical works on grammar medicine and geography still poetry is considered the heart of old english literature nearly all anglo-saxon authors are anonymous with a few exceptions such as bede and c dmon c dmon the earliest english poet we know by name served as a lay brother in the monastery at whitby 3 beowulf edit the first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic beowulf a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of old english 3 this passage describes how hrothgar s legendary ancestor scyld was found as a baby washed ashore and adopted by a noble family the translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order as such it is not typical of old english prose the modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem the words in brackets are implied in the old english by noun case and the bold words in brackets are explanations of words that have slightly different meanings in a modern context notice how what is used by the poet where a word like lo or behold would be expected this usage is similar to what-ho both an expression of surprise and a call to attention english poetry is based on stress and alliteration in alliteration the first consonant in a word alliterates with the same consonant at the beginning of another word as with g r-dena and e
