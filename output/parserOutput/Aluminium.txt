spelling 5 or aluminum lu m n m american spelling is a chemical element with symbol al and atomic number 13 it is a silvery-white soft nonmagnetic ductile metal in the boron group by mass aluminium makes up about 8 of the earth s crust it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon and the most abundant metal in the crust though it is less common in the mantle below the chief ore of aluminium is bauxite aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments instead it is found combined in over 270 different minerals 6 aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry 7 and important in transportation and building industries such as building facades and window frames 8 the oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium 7 despite its prevalence in the environment no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals 9 because of these salts abundance the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest and studies continue contents 1 physical characteristics 1.1 nuclei and isotopes 1.2 electron shell 1.3 bulk 2 chemistry 2.1 inorganic compounds 2.1.1 rarer oxidation

earth in its current form since the creation of the planet it is essentially the only isotope representing the element on earth which makes aluminium a mononuclidic element and practically equates its standard atomic weight to that of the isotope such a low standard atomic weight of aluminium a has some effects on the properties of the element see below all other isotopes are radioactive and could not have survived the most stable isotope of these is 26al half-life 720,000 years 26al is produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic ray protons and used in radiodating the ratio of 26al to 10be has been used to study transport deposition sediment storage burial times and erosion on 105 to 106 year time scales 10 most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation 4.55 billion years ago 11 the remaining isotopes of aluminium with mass numbers ranging from 21 to 43 all have half-lives well under an hour three metastable states are known all with half-lives under a minute 12 electron shell an aluminium atom has 13 electrons arranged in an electron configuration of ne 3s23p1 13 with three atoms beyond a stable noble gas configuration accordingly the combined first three ionization energies of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone 14 aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions see below the electronegativity of aluminium is 1.61 pauling scale 15 a free aluminium atom has a radius of 143 pm 16 with the three outermost electrons removed the radius shrinks to 39 pm for a 4-coordinated atom or 53.5 pm for a 6-coordinated atom 16 at standard temperature and pressure aluminium atoms when not affected by atoms of other elements form a face-centered cubic crystal system bound by metallic bonding provided by atoms outermost electrons hence aluminium at these conditions is a metal this crystal system is shared by some other metals such as lead and copper the size of a unit cell of aluminium is comparable to that of those 17 bulk etched surface from a high purity 99.9998 aluminium bar size 55 37 mm aluminium metal when in quantity is very shiny and resembles silver why another important characteristic of aluminium is its low density 2.70 g cm3 18 b aluminium is a relatively soft durable lightweight ductile and malleable with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray depending on the surface roughness it is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite a fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector approximately 92 of visible light and an excellent reflector as much as 98 of medium and far infrared radiation the yield strength of pure aluminium is 7 11 mpa while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 mpa to 600 mpa 19 aluminium has about one-third the density and stiffness of steel it is easily machined cast drawn and extruded aluminium atoms are arranged in a face-centered cubic fcc structure aluminium has a stacking-fault energy of approximately 200 mj m2 20 aluminium is a good thermal and electrical conductor having 59 the conductivity of copper both thermal and electrical while having only 30 of copper s density aluminium is capable of superconductivity with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 kelvin and a critical magnetic field of about 100 gauss 10 milliteslas 21 aluminium is the most common material for the fabrication of superconducting qubits 22 chemistry corrosion resistance can be excellent because a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide forms when the bare metal is exposed to air effectively preventing further oxidation 23 in a process termed passivation the strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper 19 this corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals in highly acidic solutions aluminium reacts with water to form hydrogen and in highly alkaline ones to form aluminates protective passivation under these conditions is negligible primarily because it is corroded by dissolved chlorides such as common sodium chloride household plumbing is never made from aluminium 24 however because of its general resistance to corrosion aluminium is one of the few metals that retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form making it an important component of silver-colored paints aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200 400 nm uv and the 3,000 10,000 nm far ir regions in the 400 700 nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by tin and silver and in the 700 3000 nm near ir by silver gold and copper 25 aluminium is oxidized by water at temperatures below 280 c to produce hydrogen aluminium hydroxide and heat 2 al 6 h 2o 2 al oh 3 3 h 2 this conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen however commercial application of this fact has challenges in circumventing the passivating oxide layer which inhibits the reaction and in storing the energy required to regenerate the aluminium metal 26 inorganic compounds the vast majority of compounds including all al-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3 the coordination number of such compounds varies but generally al3 is six-coordinate or tetracoordinate almost all compounds of aluminium iii are colorless 27 all four trihalides are well known unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides aluminium fluoride alf3 features six-coordinate al the octahedral coordination environment for alf3 is related to the compactness of the fluoride ion six of which can fit around the small al3 center alf3 sublimes with cracking at 1,291 c 2,356 f with heavier halides the coordination numbers are lower the other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral al centers these materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen although other methods exist acidification of the oxides or hydroxides affords hydrates in aqueous solution the halides often form mixtures generally containing six-coordinate al centers that feature both halide and aquo ligands when aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution they readily form complex ions such as alf h 2o 5 2 alf 3 h 2o 3 and alf 6 3 in the case of chloride polyaluminium clusters are formed such as al13o4 oh 24 h2o 12 7 aluminium hydrolysis as a function of ph citation needed coordinated water molecules are omitted aluminium forms one stable oxide with the chemical formula al2o3 it can be found in nature in the mineral corundum 28 aluminium oxide is also commonly called alumina 29 sapphire and ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals the two oxide-hydroxides alo oh are boehmite and diaspore there are three trihydroxides bayerite gibbsite and nordstrandite which differ in their crystalline structure polymorphs most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum these materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful aluminium carbide al4c3 is made by heating a mixture of the elements above 1,000 c 1,832 f the pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers it reacts with water or dilute acids to give methane the acetylide al2 c2 3 is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium aluminium nitride aln is the only nitride known for aluminium unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral al centers it can be made from the elements at 800 c 1,472 f it is air-stable material with a usefully high thermal conductivity aluminium phosphide alp is made similarly it hydrolyses to give phosphine alp 3 h 2o al oh 3 ph 3 rarer oxidation states although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature al3 centers compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the al3 species aluminium i alf alcl and albr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium the composition ali is unstable at room temperature converting to triiodide 30 3 ali ali 3 2 al displaystyle ce 3 ali - ali3 2 al a stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine al4i4 net3 4 also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are al2o and al2s al2o is made by heating the normal oxide al2o3 with silicon at 1,800 c 3,272 f in a vacuum 30 such materials quickly disproportionate to the starting materials aluminium ii very simple al ii compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of al metal with oxidants for example aluminium monoxide alo has been detected in the gas phase after explosion 31 and in stellar absorption spectra 32 more thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula r4al2 which contain an al-al bond and where r is a large organic ligand 33 organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides structure of trimethylaluminium a compound that features five-coordinate carbon a variety of compounds of empirical formula alr3 and alr1.5cl1.5 exist 34 these species usually feature tetrahedral al centers formed by dimerization with some r or cl bridging between both al atoms e g trimethylaluminium has the formula al2 ch3 6 see figure with large organic groups triorganoaluminium compounds exist as three-coordinate monomers such as triisobutylaluminium such compounds which are widely used in industrial chemistry despite the fact that they are often highly pyrophoric few analogues exist between organoaluminium and organoboron compounds other than clarification needed large organic groups the important clarification needed aluminium hydride is lithium aluminium hydride lialh4 which is used in as a reducing agent in organic chemistry it can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium trichloride 4 lih alcl 3 lialh 4 3 licl several useful derivatives of lialh4 are known e g sodium bis 2-methoxyethoxy dihydridoaluminate the simplest hydride aluminium hydride or alane remains a laboratory curiosity it is a polymer with the formula alh3 n in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula bh3 2 natural occurrence bauxite a major aluminium ore the red-brown color is due to the presence of iron minerals stable aluminium is created when hydrogen fuses with magnesium either in large stars or in supernovae 35 it is estimated to be the 14th most common element in the universe by mass-fraction 36 however among the elements that have odd atomic numbers aluminium is the third most abundant by mass fraction after hydrogen and nitrogen 36 in the earth s crust aluminium is the most abundant 8.3 by mass metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements after oxygen and silicon 27 the earth s crust has a greater abundance of aluminium than the rest of the planet primarily in aluminium silicates in the earth s mantle which is only 2 aluminium by mass these aluminium silicate minerals are largely replaced by silica and magnesium oxides overall the earth is about 1.4 aluminium by mass eighth in abundance by mass aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the earth than in the solar system and universe because the more common elements hydrogen helium neon nitrogen carbon as hydrocarbon are volatile at earth s proximity to the sun and large quantities of those were lost because of its strong affinity for oxygen aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state instead it is found in oxides or silicates feldspars the most common group of minerals in the earth s crust are aluminosilicates native aluminium metal can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments such as the interiors of certain volcanoes 37 native aluminium has been reported in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the south china sea chen et al 2011 38 propose the theory that these deposits resulted from bacterial reduction of tetrahydroxoaluminate al oh 4 38 aluminium also occurs in the minerals beryl cryolite garnet spinel and turquoise 39 impurities in al2o3 such as chromium and iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire respectively although aluminium is a common and widespread element not all aluminium minerals are economically viable sources of the metal almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite alox oh 3 2x bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions 40 bauxite is mined from large deposits in australia brazil guinea and jamaica it is also mined from lesser deposits in china india indonesia russia and suriname history the statue of anteros in piccadilly circus london was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues cast in aluminium early history aluminium metal was unknown to ancient people some sources based on an account by pliny the elder suggest a possibility that a roman in the time of the emperor tiberius had isolated aluminium c however this claim has been disputed 42 it is possible that the chinese were able to produce aluminium-containing alloys during the reign of the first jin dynasty 265 420 d the history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of alum first written record of alum made by greek historian herodotus dates back to the 5th century bce 44 the ancients are known to have used alum as dyeing mordants and for city defense 44 after the crusades alum a good indispensable in european fabric industry 45 was a subject of international commerce 46 it was imported to europe from the eastern mediterranean until the mid-15th century 47 establishing nature of alum the nature of alum remained unknown around 1530 swiss physician paracelsus identified alum as separate from vitriole sulfates suggesting it was a salt of an earth of alum 48 in 1595 german doctor and chemist andreas libavius demonstrated that alum and green and blue vitriole were formed by the same acid but different earths 49 for the undiscovered earth that formed alum he proposed the name alumina 48 in 1722 german chemist friedrich hoffmann announced his belief that the base of alum was a distinct earth 50 in 1728 french chemist tienne geoffroy saint-hilaire suggested that alum was formed by an unknown earth and the sulfuric acid 50 friedrich w hler the chemist who first thoroughly described the aluminium metal in 1754 german chemist andreas sigismund marggraf synthesized the earth of alum by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding potash 50 in 1758 french chemist pierre macquer wrote that alumina e resembled a metallic earth 51 in 1782 french chemist antoine lavoisier wrote he considered highly probable that alumina was an oxide of a metal which had an affinity for oxygen so strong no known reducing agents could overcome it 52 in 1783 lavoisier replaced the dominant phlogiston theory with the idea of oxygen combustion and stated that metallic earths were oxides of their metals 53 swedish chemist j ns jacob berzelius suggested in 1815 54 the formula alo3 for alumina 55 the correct formula al2o3 was established by the german chemist eilhard mitscherlich in 1821 this helped berzelius determine the correct atomic weight of the metal 27 55 synthesis of metal attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to 1760 51 the first successful attempt however was completed in 1824 by danish physicist and chemist hans christian rsted he reacted anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin 56 57 he presented his results and demonstrated a sample of the new metal in 1825 58 59 rsted gave little importance to his discovery 60 a different source suggests he could not continue his research because of financial reasons 61 because of this and that he published his work in an unknown to the general european public danish magazine he is often not credited as the discoverer of the element 59 some earlier sources went further and claimed rsted had not in fact isolated aluminium 62 german chemist friedrich w hler visited rsted in 1827 rsted told w hler he did not intend to continue his research on aluminium extraction w hler was engaged with the problem and investigated it on his return from denmark after repeating rsted s experiments w hler did not identify any aluminium 60 the reason for this inconsistency was only discovered in 1921 63 he conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced a powder of aluminium 57 in 1845 he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal 63 the 100 ounces 2.8 kg capstone of the washington monument washington d c united states was made in 1884 from aluminium at the time it was the largest piece of aluminium ever cast 64 rare metal as w hler s method could not yield great quantities of aluminium the metal remained rare its cost exceeded that of gold 60 french chemist henri etienne sainte-claire deville announced an industrial method of aluminium production in 1854 at the paris academy of sciences 65 aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium which w hler had used 66 subsequently bars of aluminium were exhibited for the first time to the general public at the exposition universelle of 1855 67 in 1856 deville along with companions established the world s first industrial production of aluminium 65 from 1855 to 1859 the price of aluminium dropped by an order of magnitude from us 500 to 40 per pound 68 even then aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium differed in properties by sample 69 at the next fair in paris in 1867 the visitors were presented aluminium wire and foil by the time of the next fair in 1878 aluminium had become a symbol of the future 70 electrolytic production aluminium factory in griesheim germany constructed in 1915 the first industrial large-scale production method was independently developed by french engineer paul h roult and american engineer charles martin hall it is now known as the hall h roult process h roult long could not find enough interest in his invention as demand for aluminium was still small he started industrial production of aluminium bronze in neuhausen am rheinfall in 1888 h roult sold his patents in a year the buyers appointed him to the position of director of a smelter in is re which would produce on a large scale aluminium bronze at the initiation and pure aluminium in a few months at the same time hall invented the same process and successfully tested it he then sought to employ it for a large-scale production for that however the existing smelters refused to adopt the new technique he started the pittsburgh reduction company in 1888 where he initiated mass production of aluminium in the coming years this technology was improved and new factories were constructed 71 the hall h roult process converts alumina into the metal austrian chemist carl joseph bayer discovered a way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina now known as the bayer process in 1889 modern production of the aluminium metal is based on the bayer and hall h roult processes the hall h roult process was further improved in 1920 by a team led by swedish chemist carl wilhelm s derberg this improvement greatly increased the world output of aluminium 72 mass usage give me 30,000 tonnes of aluminium and i will win the war soviet leader joseph stalin in writing to u s president franklin roosevelt in 1941 73 f prices of aluminium did drop and aluminium had become widely used in jewelry everyday items eyeglass frames and optical instruments by the early 1890s aluminium tableware began to be produced in the late 19th century and gradually supplanted copper and cast iron tableware in the first decades of the 20th century aluminium foil was also popularized at that time aluminium is soft and light it was soon discovered however that alloying it with other metals could increase its hardness while preserving the low density aluminium s ability to form alloys with other metals provided the metal many uses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for instance aluminium bronze is applied to make flexible bands sheets and wire and is widely employed in the shipbuilding and aviation industries 75 during world war i major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes they often subsidized factories and the necessary electrical supply systems 76 aviation during that time employed a new aluminium alloy duralumin invented in 1903 by german materials scientist alfred wilm 77 world production of aluminium since 1900 by the mid-20th century aluminium had become a part of everyday lives also becoming an essential component of houseware 78 during the mid-20th century aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material with buildings using for both basic construction and interior 79 and advanced its use in military engineering for both airplanes and land armor vehicle engines 73 in the beginning of the second half of that century the space race began earth s first artificial satellite launched in 1957 consisted of two separate aluminium semi-spheres joined together and all subsequent space vehicles have been made of aluminium 72 the aluminium can was invented in 1956 and employed as a storage for drinks in 1958 80 throughout the 20th century the production of aluminium rose rapidly while the world production of aluminium in 1900 was 6,800 metric tons the annual production first exceeded 100,000 metric tons in 1916 1,000,000 tons in 1941 10,000,000 tons in 1971 81 in the 1970s the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity it entered the london metal exchange the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world in 1978 72 the output continued to grow the annual production of aluminium exceeded 50,000,000 metric tons in 2013 81 the real price for aluminium declined from 14,000 per metric ton in 1900 to 2,340 in 1948 all prices in this subsection are in 1998 united states dollars 81 extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and the scale of the economies however the need to exploit lower-grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs above all energy increased the net cost of aluminium 82 the real price began to grow in the 1970s with the rise of energy cost 83 production moved from the industrialized countries to countries where production was cheaper 84 after aluminium became an exchange commodity aluminium has been traded for united states dollars and its price fluctuated along with the exchange rates of the currency 85 production costs in the late 20th century changed because of advances in technology lower energy prices exchange rates of the united states dollar and alumina prices 86 the bric countries combined share grew in the first decade of the 21st century from 32.6 to 56.5 in primary production and 21.4 to 47.8 in primary consumption 87 china is accumulating an especially large share of world s production thanks to abundance of resources cheap energy and governmental stimuli 88 it also increased its consumption share from 2 in 1972 to 40 in 2010 89 in the united states western europe and japan most aluminium was consumed in transportation engineering construction and packaging 90 etymology aluminium is named after alumina or aluminium oxide in modern nomenclature the word alumina comes from alum the mineral from which it was collected the word alum comes from alumen a latin word meaning bitter salt 91 the word alumen stems from the proto-indo-european root alu- meaning bitter or beer 92 british chemist humphry davy who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal is credited as the person who named aluminium in 1808 he suggested the metal be named alumium 93 this suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from france germany and sweden who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide alumina from which it would be isolated 52 in 1812 davy chose aluminum thus producing the modern name 94 however it is spelled and pronounced differently outside of north america aluminum is in use in the u s and canada while aluminium is in use elsewhere 95 spelling the -ium suffix followed the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time potassium sodium magnesium calcium and strontium all of which davy isolated himself nevertheless element names ending in -um were not unknown at the time for example platinum known to europeans since the 16th century molybdenum discovered in 1778 and tantalum discovered in 1802 the -um suffix is consistent with the universal spelling alumina for the oxide as opposed to aluminia compare to lanthana the oxide of lanthanum and magnesia ceria and thoria the oxides of magnesium cerium and thorium respectively in 1812 british scientist thomas young 96 wrote an anonymous review of davy s book in which he objected to aluminum and proposed the name aluminium for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word in preference to aluminum which has a less classical sound 97 this name did catch on while the -um spelling was occasionally used in britain the american scientific language used -ium from the start 98 most scientists used -ium throughout the world in the 19th century 99 it still remains the standard in most other languages 95 in 1828 american lexicographer noah webster used exclusively the aluminum spelling in his american dictionary of the english language 100 in the 1830s the -um spelling started to gain usage in the united states by the 1860s it had become the more common spelling there outside science 98 in 1892 hall used the -um spelling in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal despite his constant use of the -ium spelling in all the patents he filed between 1886 and 1903 it was subsequently suggested this was a typo rather than intended 95 by 1890 both spellings had been common in the u s overall the -ium spelling being slightly more common by 1895 the situation had reversed by 1900 aluminum had been twice as common as aluminium during the following decade the -um spelling dominated american usage 101 in 1925 the american chemical society adopted this spelling 101 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in 1990 102 in 1993 they recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant 102 the same is true for the most recent 2005 edition of the iupac nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 103 iupac official publications use the -ium spelling as primary but list both where appropriate g english wikipedia follows this standard by adopting the aluminium spelling as the sole spelling in chemistry-related articles production and refinement extrusion billets of aluminium bayer process and hall h roult processes bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide al2o3 by the bayer process 9 relevant chemical equations are al 2o 3 2 naoh 2 naalo 2 h 2o 2 h 2o naalo 2 al oh 3 naoh 2 al oh 3 al2o3 3 h2o the intermediate sodium aluminate with the simplified formula naalo2 is soluble in strongly alkaline water and the other components of the ore are not depending on the quality of the bauxite ore twice as much waste bauxite tailings as alumina is generated the conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the hall h roult process in this energy-intensive process a solution of alumina in a molten 950 and 980 c 1,740 and 1,800 f mixture of cryolite na3alf6 with calcium fluoride is electrolyzed to produce metallic aluminium al 3 3 e al the liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off and usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing carbon dioxide is produced at the carbon anode 2 o 2 c co 2 4 e the carbon anode is consumed by reaction with oxygen to form carbon dioxide gas with a small quantity of fluoride gases in modern smelters the gas is filtered through alumina to remove fluorine compounds and return aluminium fluoride to the electrolytic cells the anode i e the reduction cell must be replaced regularly since it is consumed in the process the cathode is also eroded mainly by electrochemical processes and liquid metal movement induced by intense electrolytic currents after five to ten years depending on the current used in the electrolysis a cell must be rebuilt because of cathode wear aluminium electrolysis with the hall h roult process consumes a lot of energy the worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15 0.5 kilowatt-hours per kilogram of aluminium produced 52 to 56 mj kg some smelters achieve approximately 12.8 kw h kg 46.1 mj kg compare this to the heat of reaction 31 mj kg and the gibbs free energy of reaction 29 mj kg minimizing line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kiloamperes state-of-the-art smelters operate at about 350 ka the hall heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99 further purification can be done by the hoopes process this process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte the resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99 9 105 electric power represents about 20 to 40 of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of the smelter aluminium production consumes roughly 5 of electricity generated in the us 102 aluminium producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive such as the united arab emirates with its large natural gas supplies 106 and iceland 107 and norway 108 with energy generated from renewable sources the world s largest smelters of alumina are located in the people s republic of china russia and the provinces of quebec and british columbia in canada 109 110 aluminium spot price 1987 2012 in 2005 the people s republic of china was the top producer of aluminium with almost a one-fifth world share followed by russia canada and the us reports the british geological survey over the last 50 years australia has become the world s top producer of bauxite ore and a major producer and exporter of alumina before being overtaken by china in 2007 109 111 australia produced 77 million tonnes of bauxite in 2013 112 the australian deposits have some refining problems some being high in silica but have the advantage of being shallow and relatively easy to mine 113 aluminium chloride electrolysis process the high energy consumption of hall h roult process motivated the development of the electrolytic process based on aluminium chloride the pilot plant with 6500 tons year output was started in 1976 by alcoa the plant offered two advantages i energy requirements were 40 less than plants using the hall h roult process and ii the more accessible kaolinite instead of bauxite and cryolite was used for feedstock nonetheless the pilot plant was shut down the reasons for failure were the cost of aluminium chloride general technology maturity problems and leakage of the trace amounts of toxic polychlorinated biphenyl compounds 114 115 aluminium chloride process can also be used for the co-production of titanium depending on titanium contents in kaolinite aluminium carbothermic process the non-electrolytic aluminium carbothermic process of aluminium production would theoretically be cheaper and consume less energy however it has been in the experimental phase for decades because the high operating temperature creates difficulties in material technology that have not yet been solved 116 117 recycling aluminium recycling code aluminium is theoretically 100 recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities according to the international resource panel s metal stocks in society report the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society i e in cars buildings electronics etc is 80 kg 180 lb much of this is in more-developed countries 350 500 kg 770 1,100 lb per capita rather than less-developed countries 35 kg 77 lb per capita knowing the per capita stocks and their approximate lifespans is important for planning recycling recovery of the metal through recycling has become an important task of the aluminium industry recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to public awareness recycling involves melting the scrap a process that requires only 5 of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore though a significant part up to 15 of the input material is lost as dross ash-like oxide 118 an aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross with values reported below 1 119 the dross can undergo a further process to extract aluminium europe has achieved high rates of aluminium recycling ranging from 42 of beverage cans 85 of construction materials and 95 of transport vehicles 120 recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium secondary aluminium is produced in a wide range of formats and is employed in 80 of alloy injections another important use is extrusion white dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially 121 the process produces aluminium billets together with a highly complex waste material this waste is difficult to manage it reacts with water releasing a mixture of gases including among others hydrogen acetylene and ammonia which spontaneously ignites on contact with air 122 contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas despite these difficulties the waste is used as a filler in asphalt and concrete 123 applications this section needs additional citations for verification please help by adding citations to reliable sources

production of aluminium in 2005 was 31.9 million tonnes it exceeded that of any other metal except iron 837.5 million tonnes 125 aluminium is almost always alloyed which markedly improves its mechanical properties especially when tempered for example the common aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of 92 to 99 aluminium 126 the main alloying agents are copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon e g duralumin with the levels of other metals in a few percent by weight 127 household aluminium foil aluminium-bodied austin a40 sports c 1951 aluminium can some of the many uses for aluminium metal are in transportation 128 automobiles aircraft trucks railway cars marine vessels bicycles spacecraft etc as sheet tube and castings packaging 129 cans foil frame of etc food

instruments some guitar models sport aluminium diamond plates on the surface of the instruments usually either chrome or black kramer guitars and travis bean are both known for having produced guitars with necks made of aluminium which gives the instrument a very distinctive sound aluminium is used to make some guitar resonators and some electric guitar speakers 139 aluminium is usually alloyed it is used as pure metal only when corrosion resistance and or workability is more important than strength or hardness the strength of aluminium alloys is abruptly increased with small additions of scandium zirconium or hafnium 140 a thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by physical vapor deposition or very infrequently chemical vapor deposition or other chemical means which to form optical coatings and mirrors aluminium compounds because aluminium is abundant and most of its derivatives exhibit low toxicity the compounds of aluminium enjoy wide and sometimes large-scale applications alumina aluminium oxide al2o3 and the associated oxy-hydroxides and trihydroxides are produced or extracted from minerals on a large scale the great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium in 2013 about 10 of the domestic shipments in the united states were used for other applications 141 one major use is to absorb water where it is viewed as a contaminant or impurity alumina is used to remove water from hydrocarbons in preparation for subsequent processes that would be poisoned by moisture aluminium oxides are common catalysts for industrial processes e g the claus process to convert hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in refineries and to alkylate amines many industrial catalysts are supported by alumina meaning that the expensive

range of properties are used in engineering structures alloy systems are classified by a number system ansi or by names indicating their main alloying constituents din and iso the strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes a lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation one important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their fatigue strength unlike steels aluminium alloys have no well-defined fatigue limit meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs under even very small cyclic loadings engineers must assess applications and design for a fixed and finite life of the structure rather than infinite life another important property of aluminium alloys is sensitivity to heat workshop procedures are complicated by the fact that aluminium unlike steel melts without first glowing red manual blow torch operations require additional skill and experience aluminium alloys like all structural alloys are subject to internal stresses after heat operations such as welding and casting the lower melting points of aluminium alloys make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief stress can be relieved and controlled during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven followed by gradual cooling in effect annealing the stresses the low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded use in rocketry even in combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500 k the agena upper stage engine used regeneratively cooled aluminium in some parts of the nozzle including the thermally critical throat region another alloy of some value is aluminium bronze cu-al alloy biology bauxite tailings storage facility in stade germany the aluminium industry generates about 70 million tons of this waste

occurrence in the earth crust aluminium has no known function in biology aluminium salts are remarkably nontoxic aluminium sulfate having an ld50 of 6207 mg kg oral mouse which corresponds to 500 grams for an 80 kg 180 lb person 9 the extremely low acute toxicity notwithstanding the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce health concerns in very high doses aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood brain barrier 152 a small percentage of people are allergic to aluminium and experience contact dermatitis digestive disorders vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium such as antiperspirants and antacids in those without allergies aluminium is not as toxic as heavy metals but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in amounts greater than 40 mg day per kg of body mass 153 the use of aluminium cookware has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general however excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure levels citation needed consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption 154 and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues 155 aluminium increases estrogen-related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory 156 the estrogen-like effects of these salts have led to their classification as metalloestrogens there is little evidence that aluminium in antiperspirants causes skin irritation 9 nonetheless its occurrence in antiperspirants dyes such as aluminium lake and food additives has caused concern 157 although there is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adults 158 some studies point to risks associated with increased exposure to the metal 157 aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water 159 it is classified as a non-carcinogen by the us department of health and human services 153 in case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium deferoxamine mesylate may be given to help eliminate it from the body by chelation 160 occupational safety exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause pulmonary fibrosis the united states occupational safety and health administration osha has set a permissible exposure limit of 15 mg m3 time weighted average twa for total exposure and 5 mg m3 twa for respiratory exposure the us national institute for occupational safety and health niosh recommended exposure limit is the same for respiratory exposure but is 10 mg m3 for total exposure and 5 mg m3 for fumes and powder fine aluminium powder can ignite or explode posing another workplace hazard 161 162 alzheimer s disease aluminium has controversially been implicated as a factor in alzheimer s disease 163 according to the alzheimer s society the medical and scientific opinion is that studies have not convincingly demonstrated a causal relationship between aluminium and alzheimer s disease 164 research in this area has been inconclusive aluminium accumulation may be a consequence of the disease rather than a causal agent 165 166 effect on plants aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acid soils although it is generally harmless to plant growth in ph-neutral soils the concentration in acid soils of toxic al3 cations increases and disturbs root growth and function 167 168 169 170 most acid soils are saturated with aluminium rather than hydrogen ions the acidity of the soil is therefore a result of hydrolysis of aluminium compounds 171 the concept of corrected lime potential 172 is now used to define the degree of base saturation in soil testing to determine the lime requirement 173 174 wheat has developed a tolerance to aluminium releasing organic compounds that bind to harmful aluminium cations sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism the first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat it was shown that sorghum s aluminium tolerance is controlled by a single gene as for wheat 175 this adaptation is not found in all plants biodegradation a spanish scientific report from 2001 claimed that the fungus geotrichum candidum consumes the aluminium in compact discs 176 177 other reports all refer back to the 2001 spanish report and there is no supporting original research better documented the bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus cladosporium resinae are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels not av gas and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium 178 however these life forms do not directly attack or consume the aluminium rather the metal is corroded by microbe waste products 179 see also aluminium granules

63.5 lead 207.2 1 aluminium s low density compared to the other metals arises from the fact that its nuclei are much lighter while difference in the unit cell size does not compensate for this difference deville had established that heating a mixture of sodium chloride clay and charcoal results many metallic globules which would be aluminium this was published in the proceedings of the academy of sciences but eventually forgotten 41 alternatively french chemist andr duboin discovered that heating in a crucible a mixture of borax alumina and smaller quantities of dichromate and silica formed impure aluminium boric acid is abundant in italy this hints at the possibility that boric acid potash and clay under the reducing influence of coal may have produced aluminium in rome 41 alumina was plentiful and could be reduced by coke in the presence of copper giving aluminium copper alloys the chinese did not however have the technology to produce pure aluminium and the temperatures needed around 2000 c were not achievable 43 the terms earth of alum and alumina refer to the same substance the difference in the text between the two is only justified by how the authors referred to it the mentioned german-speaking authors used earth of alum alaun-erde while the french authors used alumina alumine stalin needed aluminium to build more aircraft 74 for instance see the
