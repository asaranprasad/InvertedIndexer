scale height - wikipedia scale height from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in various scientific contexts a scale height is a distance over which a quantity decreases by a factor of e approximately 2.72 the base of natural logarithms it is usually denoted by the capital letter h contents 1 scale height used in a simple atmospheric pressure model 2 planetary examples 3 see also 4 references scale height used in a simple atmospheric pressure model edit for planetary atmospheres scale height is the increase in altitude for which the atmospheric pressure decreases by a factor of e the scale height remains constant for a particular temperature it can be calculated by 1 2 h k t m g displaystyle h frac kt mg or equivalently h r t m g displaystyle h frac rt mg where k boltzmann constant 1.38 x 10 23 j k 1 r gas constant t mean atmospheric temperature in kelvins 250 k 3 for earth m mean mass of a molecule units kg m mean molecular mass of one atmospheric particle 0.029 kg mol for earth g acceleration due to gravity on planetary surface m s the pressure force per unit area at a given altitude is a result of the weight of the overlying atmosphere if at a height of z the atmosphere has density and pressure p then moving upwards at an infinitesimally small height dz will decrease the pressure by amount dp equal to the weight of a layer of atmosphere of thickness dz thus d p d z g displaystyle frac dp dz -g rho where g is the acceleration due to gravity for small dz it is possible to assume g to be constant the minus sign indicates that as the height increases the pressure decreases therefore using the equation of state for an ideal gas of mean molecular mass m at temperature t the density can be expressed as m p k t displaystyle rho frac mp kt combining these equations gives d p p d z k t m g displaystyle frac dp p frac -dz frac kt mg which can then be incorporated with the equation for h given above to give d p p d z h displaystyle frac dp p - frac dz h which will not change unless the temperature does integrating the above and assuming where p0 is the pressure at height z 0 pressure at sea level the pressure at height z can be written as p p 0 exp z h displaystyle p p 0 exp left - frac z h right this translates as the pressure decreasing exponentially with height 4 in earth s atmosphere the pressure at sea level p0 averages about 1.01 105 pa the mean molecular mass of dry air is 28.964 u and hence 28.964 1.660 10 27 4.808 10 26 kg and g 9.81 m s as a function of temperature the scale height of earth s atmosphere is therefore 1.38 4.808 9.81 103 29.26 m deg this yields the following scale heights for representative air temperatures t 290 k h 8500 m t 273 k h 8000 m t 260 k h 7610 m t 210 k h 6000 m these figures should be compared with the temperature and density of earth s atmosphere plotted at nrlmsise-00 which shows the air density dropping from 1200 g m3 at sea level to 0.53 .125 g m3 at 70 km a factor of 9600 indicating an average scale height of 70 ln 9600 7.64 km consistent with the indicated average air temperature over that range of close to 260 k note density is related to pressure by the ideal gas laws therefore with some departures caused by varying temperature density will also decrease exponentially with height from a sea level value of 0 roughly equal to 1.2 kg m 3 at heights over 100 km molecular diffusion means that each molecular atomic species has its own scale height planetary examples edit approximate atmospheric scale heights for selected solar system bodies follow venus 15.9 km 5 earth 8.5 km 6 mars 11.1 km 7 jupiter 27 km 8 saturn 59.5 km 9 titan 21 km 10 uranus 27.7 km 11 neptune 19.1 20.3 km 12 pluto 60 km 13 see also edit time constant references edit american meteorological society ams wolfram research pdf permanent dead link nasa retrieved 28 september 2013 nasa retrieved 28 september 2013 nasa retrieved 28 september 2013 nasa retrieved 28 september 2013 nasa retrieved 28 september 2013 justus c g aleta duvall vernon w keller 1 august 2003 international workshop on planetary probe atmospheric entry and descent trajectory analysis and science lisbon portugal october 6 9 2003 proceedings esa sp-544 esa retrieved 28 september 2013 nasa retrieved 28 september 2013 nasa retrieved 28 september 2013 nasa retrieved 2016-10-20 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title scale height oldid 818190657 categories atmosphere atmospheric dynamics hidden categories all articles with dead external links articles with dead external links from january 2018 articles with permanently dead external links navigation menu search this page was last edited on 2 january 2018 at 03 47 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
