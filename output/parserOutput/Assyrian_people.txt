syriac christians are an ethnic group indigenous to the middle east 35 36 some of them self-identify as arameans 37 or as chaldeans 38 they speak east aramaic languages as well as the dominant languages in their countries of residence 39 the assyrians are typically syriac christians who claim descent from assyria one of the oldest civilizations in the world dating back to 2500 bc in ancient mesopotamia 40 the areas that form the assyrian homeland are parts of present-day northern iraq southeastern turkey northwestern iran and more recently northeastern syria 41 42 the majority have migrated to other regions of the world including north america the levant australia europe russia and the caucasus during the past century emigration was triggered by events such as the massacres of diyarbak r the assyrian genocide concurrent with the armenian greek genocide during world war i by the ottoman empire and allied kurdish tribes the simele massacre in iraq in 1933 the iranian revolution of 1979 arab nationalist ba athist policies in iraq and syria the rise of islamic state of iraq and the levant isis and its takeover of most of the nineveh plains 43 44 assyrians are predominantly christian mostly adhering to the east and west syrian liturgical rites of christianity 45 the churches that constitute the east syrian rite include the assyrian church of the east ancient church of the east and chaldean catholic church whereas the churches of the west syrian rite are the syriac orthodox church and syriac catholic church both rites use classical syriac as their liturgical language most recently the 2003 iraq war and the syrian civil war which began in 2011 have displaced much of the remaining assyrian community from their homeland as a result of ethnic and religious persecution at the hands of islamic extremists of the one million or more iraqis reported by the united nations to have fled iraq since the occupation nearly 40 were assyrians even though assyrians comprised only around 3 of the pre-war iraqi demography 46 47 48 according to a 2013 report by a chaldean syriac assyrian popular council official it is estimated that only 300,000 assyrians remain in iraq 49 because of the emergence of isis and the taking over of much of the assyrian homeland by the terror group another major wave of assyrian displacement has taken place isis was driven out from the assyrian villages in the khabour river valley and the areas surrounding the city of al-hasakah in syria by 2015 and from the nineveh plains in iraq by 2017 since the expulsion of isis the nineveh plains have been divided into iraqi and kurdish-controlled zones with assyrian militias on both sides in gozarto northern syria assyrian groups have been taking part both politically and

ashurbanipal c 645-635 bc in prehistoric times the region that was to become known as assyria and subartu was home to neanderthals such as the remains of those which have been found at the shanidar cave the earliest neolithic sites in assyria belonged to the jarmo culture c 7100 bc and tell hassuna the centre of the hassuna culture c 6000 bc the history of assyria begins with the formation of the city of assur perhaps as early as the 25th century bc 50 the assyrian king list records kings dating from the 25th century bc onwards the earliest being tudiya who was a contemporary of ibrium of ebla however many of these early kings would have been local rulers and from the late 24th century bc to the early 22nd century bc they were usually subjects of the akkadian empire during the early bronze age period sargon of akkad united all the native semitic-speaking peoples and the sumerians of mesopotamia including the assyrians under the akkadian empire 2335-2154 bc the cities of assur and nineveh together with a number of other towns and cities existed as early as the 25th century bc although they appear to have been sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time rather than independent states the sumerians were eventually absorbed into the akkadian assyro-babylonian population 51 from 1700 bc and onward the sumerian language was preserved by ancient babylonians and assyrians only as a liturgical and classical language for religious artistic and scholarly purposes 52 in the traditions of the assyrian church of the east they are descended from abraham s grandson dedan son of jokshan progenitor of the ancient assyrians 53 however there is no historical basis for the biblical assertion whatsoever there is no mention in assyrian records which date as far back as the 24th century bc the assyrian people after the fall of their empire fell under foreign domination ever since the persian empire was founded which consumed the entire neo-babylonian or chaldean empire in 539 bc assyrians became front line soldiers for the persian empire under xerxes i playing a major role in the battle of marathon under darius i in 490 bc 54 the assyrian army accounted for three legions of the roman army defending the parthian border in the 1st century it was the assyrian army that enabled vespasian s coup from the later 2nd century the roman senate included several notable assyrians including tiberius claudius pompeianus and avidius cassius from the 1st century bc assyria was the theatre of the protracted roman persian wars it would become a roman province assyria provincia from 116 to 363 ad despite the influx of foreign elements the presence of assyrians is confirmed by the worship of the god ashur all proof of the continuity of the assyrians 55 the greeks parthians and romans had a rather low-level of integration with the local population in mesopotamia which allowed their cultures to survive 56 early christian period map of as rist n 226 ad-637 ad the assyrians were christianized in the first to third centuries in roman syria and roman assyria the population of the sasanian province of as rist n was a mixed one composed of assyrians arameans in the far south and the western deserts and persians 57 the greek element in the cities still strong during the parthian empire ceased to be ethnically distinct in sasanian times the majority of the population were eastern aramaic speakers along with the arameans armenians greeks and nabataeans the assyrians were among the first people to convert to christianity and spread eastern christianity to the far east the council of seleucia of ca 325 dealt with jurisdictional conflicts among the leading bishops they were divided by the nestorian schism in the 5th century and from the 8th century they became a minority religion following the muslim conquest of persia at the subsequent council of seleucia-ctesiphon of 410 the christian communities of mesopotamia renounced all subjection to antioch and the western bishops and the bishop of seleucia-ctesiphon modern al-mada in assumed the rank of catholicos whereas latin and greek christian cultures became protected by the roman and byzantine empires respectively assyrian christianity often found itself marginalized and persecuted the nestorian schism and monophysite schisms of the 5th century divided the church into separate denominations with the rise of syriac christianity eastern aramaic enjoyed a renaissance as a classical language in the 2nd to 8th centuries and the modern assyrian people continue to speak eastern neo-aramaic languages assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the arab-islamic conquest in the mid-7th century arab conquest the assyrians initially experienced some periods of religious and cultural freedom interspersed with periods of severe religious and ethnic persecution after the 7th century muslim conquest of persia assyrians contributed to islamic civilizations during the umayyad and abbasid caliphates by translating works of greek philosophers to syriac and afterwards to arabic they also excelled in philosophy science qusta ibn luqa masawaiyh 58 eutychius of alexandria and jabril ibn bukhtishu 59 and theology such as tatian bardaisan babai the great nestorius and thomas of marga and the personal physicians of the abbasid caliphs were often assyrians such as the long-serving bukhtishu dynasty 60 many scholars of the house of wisdom were of assyrian christian background 61 indigenous assyrians became second-class citizens dhimmi in a greater arab islamic state and those who resisted arabisation and conversion to islam were subject to severe religious ethnic and cultural discrimination and had certain restrictions imposed upon them 62 assyrians were excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for muslims they did not enjoy the same political rights as muslims their word was not equal to that of a muslim in legal and civil matters as christians they were subject to payment of a special tax jizya they were banned from spreading their religion further or building new churches in muslim-ruled lands but were also expected to adhere to the same laws of property contract and obligation as the muslim arabs 63 they couldn t seek conversion of a muslim a non-muslim man couldn t marry a muslim woman and the child of such a marriage would be considered muslim they couldn t own a muslim slave and had to wear different clothing from muslims in order to be distinguishable in addition to the jizya tax they were also required to pay the kharaj tax on their land which was heavier than the jizya however they were ensured protection given religious freedom and to govern themselves in accordance to their own laws 64 as non-islamic proselytising was punishable by death under sharia the assyrians were forced into preaching in transoxiana central asia india mongolia and china where they established numerous churches the church of the east was considered to be one of the major christian powerhouses in the world alongside latin christianity in europe and the byzantine empire 65 from the 7th century ad onwards mesopotamia saw a steady influx of arabs kurds and other iranian peoples 66 and later turkic peoples assyrians were increasingly marginalized persecuted and gradually became a minority in their own homeland conversion to islam as a result of heavy taxation which also resulted in decreased revenue from their rulers as a result the new converts migrated to muslim garrison towns nearby assyrians remained dominant in upper mesopotamia as late as the 14th century 67 and the city of ashur was still occupied by assyrians during the islamic period until the mid-14th century when the muslim turco-mongol ruler timur conducted a religiously motivated massacre against assyrians after there were no records of assyrians remaining in ashur according to the archaeological and numismatic record from this point the assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland 68 from the 19th century after the rise of nationalism in the balkans the ottomans started viewing assyrians and other christians in their eastern front as a potential threat the kurdish emirs sought to consolidate their power by attacking assyrian communities which were already well-established there scholars estimate that tens of thousands of assyrian in the hakkari region were massacred in 1843 when bedr khan beg the emir of bohtan invaded their region 69 after a later massacre in 1846 the ottomans were forced by the western powers into intervening in the region and the ensuing conflict destroyed the kurdish emirates and reasserted the ottoman power in the area the assyrians were subject to the massacres of diyarbak r soon after 70 being culturally ethnically and linguistically distinct from their muslim neighbors in the middle east the arabs persians kurds turks the assyrians have endured much hardship throughout their recent history as a result of religious and ethnic persecution by these groups 71 mongolian and turkic rule after initially coming under the control of the seljuk empire and the buyid dynasty the region eventually came under the control of the mongol empire after the fall of baghdad in 1258 the mongol khans were sympathetic with christians and did not harm them the most prominent among them was probably isa kelemechi a diplomat astrologer and head of the christian affairs in yuan china he spent some time in persia under the ilkhanate the 14th century massacres of timur devastated the assyrian people timur s massacres and pillages of all that was christian drastically reduced their existence at the end of the reign of timur the assyrian population had almost been eradicated in many places toward the end of the thirteenth century bar hebraeus the noted assyrian scholar and hierarch found much quietness in his diocese in mesopotamia syria s diocese he wrote was wasted citation needed the region was later controlled by the in iran-based turkic confederations of the aq qoyunlu and kara koyunlu subsequently all assyrians like with the rest of the ethnicities living in the former aq qoyunlu territories fell into safavid hands from 1501 and on from iranian safavid to confirmed ottoman rule the ottomans secured their control over mesopotamia and syria in the first half of the 17th century following the ottoman safavid war 1623 39 and the resulting treaty of zuhab non-muslims were organised into millets syriac christians however were often considered one millet alongside armenians until the 19th century when nestorian syriac orthodox and chaldeans gained that right as well 72 a religious schism amongs the assyrians took place in the mid to late 16th century dissent over the hereditary succession within the assyrian church of the east grew until 1552 when a group of assyrian bishops from the northern regions of amid and salmas elected a priest mar yohannan sulaqa as a rival patriarch to look for a bishop of metropolitan rank to consecrate him patriarch sulaqa traveled to the pope in rome and entered into communion with the catholic church in 1553 he was consecrated bishop and elevated to the rank of patriarch taking the name of mar shimun viii he was granted the title of patriarch of the chaldeans and his church was named the church of athura and mosul 73 mar shimun viii yohannan sulaqa returned to northern mesopotamia in the same year and fixed his seat in amid before being put to death by the partisans of the assyrian church of the east patriarch of alqosh 74 57 he ordained five metropolitan bishops thus beginning a new ecclesiastical hierarchy the patriarchal line known as the shimun line the area of influence of this patriarchate soon moved from amid east fixing the see after many places in the isolated assyrian village of qochanis although this new church eventually drifted away from rome by 1600 ad and reentered communion with the assyrian church the archbishop of amid reinstated relations with rome in 1672 ad giving birth to the modern chaldean catholic church in the 1840s many of the assyrians living in the mountains of hakkari in the south eastern corner of the ottoman empire were massacred by the kurdish emirs of hakkari and bohtan 75 another major massacre of assyrians and armenians in the ottoman empire occurred between 1894 and 1897 ad by turkish troops and their kurdish allies during the rule of sultan abdul hamid ii the motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert pan-islamism in the ottoman empire resentment at the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous christian communities and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering ottoman empire assyrians were massacred in diyarbakir hasankeyef sivas and other parts of anatolia by sultan abdul hamid ii these attacks caused the death of over thousands of assyrians and the forced ottomanisation of the inhabitants of 245 villages the turkish troops looted the remains of the assyrian settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by kurds unarmed assyrian women and children were raped tortured and murdered 76 world war i and aftermath the assyrian flag prior to the first world war the burning of bodies of assyrian women the assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th 18th and 19th centuries ad 77 culminating in the large scale hamidian massacres of unarmed men women and children by muslim turks and kurds in the late 19th century at the hands of the ottoman empire and its associated largely kurdish and arab militias which further greatly reduced numbers particularly in southeastern turkey the most significant recent persecution against the assyrian population was the assyrian genocide which occurred during the first world war between 275,000 and 300,000 assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the ottoman empire and their kurdish allies totalling up to two-thirds of the entire assyrian population this led to a large-scale migration of turkish-based assyrian people into countries such as syria iran and iraq where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the arabs and kurds as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the middle east such as armenia georgia and russia 78 79 80 81 in reaction to the assyrian genocide and lured by british and russian promises of an independent nation the assyrians led by agha petros and malik khoshaba of the bit-tyari tribe fought alongside the allies against ottoman forces in an assyrian war of independence despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the assyrians fought successfully scoring a number of victories over the turks and kurds this situation continued until their russian allies left the war and armenian resistance broke leaving the assyrians surrounded isolated and cut off from lines of supply the sizable assyrian presence in south eastern anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of world war i modern history assyrian refugees on a wagon moving to a newly constructed village on the khabur river in syria the majority of assyrians living in what is today modern turkey were forced to flee to either syria or iraq after the turkish victory during the turkish war of independence in 1932 assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of iraq and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation the assyrian leader mar eshai shimun xxiii asked the league of nations to recognize the right of the assyrians to govern the area known as the assyrian triangle in northern iraq the assyrian levies were founded by the british in 1928 with ancient assyrian military rankings such as rab-shakeh rab-talia and tartan being revived for the first time in millennia for this force the assyrians were prized by the british rulers for their fighting qualities loyalty bravery and discipline 82 and were used to help the british put down insurrections among the arabs and kurds during world war ii eleven assyrian companies saw action in palestine and another four served in cyprus the parachute company was attached to the royal marine commando and were involved in fighting in albania italy and greece the assyrian levies played a major role in subduing the pro-nazi iraqi forces at the battle of habbaniya in 1941 however this cooperation with the british was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed kingdom of iraq the tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the simele massacre by the iraqi army in august 1933 the events lead to the expulsion of shimun xxiii eshai the catholicos patriarch of the assyrian church of the east to the united states where resided until his death in 1975 83 84 celebration at a syriac orthodox monastery in mosul ottoman syria early 20th century the period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the assyrians the regime of president abd al-karim qasim in particular saw the assyrians accepted into mainstream society many urban assyrians became successful businessmen others were well represented in politics and the military their towns and villages flourished undisturbed and assyrians came to excel and be over represented in sports the ba ath party seized power in iraq and syria in 1963 introducing laws aimed at suppressing the assyrian national identity via arabization policies the giving of traditional assyrian names was banned and assyrian schools political parties churches and literature were repressed assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as iraqi syrian christians assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among assyrians along religious lines e g assyrian church of the east vs chaldean catholic church vs syriac orthodox church 85 in response to baathist persecution the assyrians of the zowaa movement within the assyrian democratic movement took up armed struggle against the iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of yonadam kanna 86 and then joined up with the iraqi-kurdistan front in the early 1990s yonadam kanna in particular was a target of the saddam hussein ba ath government for many years the anfal campaign of 1986 1989 in iraq resulted in 2,000 assyrians being murdered through its gas campaigns over 31 towns and villages 25 assyrian monasteries and churches were razed to the ground some assyrians were murdered others were deported to large cities and their lands and homes then being appropriated by arabs and kurds 87 88 21st century assyrian genocide memorial in yerevan armenia since the 2003 iraq war social unrest and chaos have resulted in the unprovoked persecution of assyrians in iraq mostly by islamic extremists both shia and sunni and kurdish nationalists ex dohuk riots of 2011 aimed at assyrians yazidis in places such as dora a neighborhood in southwestern baghdad the majority of its assyrian population has either fled abroad or to northern iraq or has been murdered 89 islamic resentment over the united states occupation of iraq and incidents such as the jyllands-posten muhammad cartoons and the pope benedict xvi islam controversy have resulted in muslims attacking assyrian communities since the start of the iraq war at least 46 churches and monasteries have been bombed 90 in recent years the assyrians in northern iraq and northeast syria have become the target of extreme unprovoked islamic terrorism as a result assyrians have taken up arms alongside other groups such as the kurds turcomans and armenians in response to unprovoked attacks by al qaeda isis isil nusra front and other terrorist islamic fundamentalist groups in 2014 islamic terrorists of isis attacked assyrian towns and villages in the assyrian homeland of northern iraq together with cities such as mosul and kirkuk which have large assyrian populations there have been reports of atrocities committed by isis terrorists since including beheadings crucifixions child murders rape forced conversions ethnic cleansing robbery and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non muslims assyrians in iraq have responded by forming armed militias to defend their territories the dawronoye modernization movement has a growing influence on assyrian identity in the 21st century 91 it is particularly influential in syria where the syriac union party sup has become a major political actor in the democratic federation of northern syria in august 2016 the ourhi centre in the city of zalin was started by the assyrian community to educate teachers in order to make syriac an optional language of instruction in public schools 92 93 which then started with the 2016 17 academic year 94 with that academic year states the rojava education committee three curriculums have replaced the old one to include teaching in three languages kurdish arabic and assyrian 95 associated with the sup is the syriac military council an assyrian militia operating in syria established in january 2013 to protect and stand up for the national rights of assyrians in syria as well as working together with the other communities in syria to change the current government of bashar al-assad 96 since 2015 it is a component of the syrian democratic forces demographics homeland the assyrian triangle is the area with the greatest concentration of assyrians in the assyrian homeland and where they seek autonomy today the assyrian homeland constitutes northern iraq southeastern turkey northwestern iran and northeastern syria 97 42 this includes the ancient cities of nineveh mosul nuhadra dohuk arrapha beth garmai kirkuk amida diyarbakir edessa urhoy urfa harran nisabina zalin nusaybin qamishli arbela erbil and also the christianized settlements from the 5th century ad after the spread of islam such as urmia in iran hakkari yuksekova ukurca and semdinli uludere and tur abdin midyat and kafro in turkey among others 98 assyrians have existed in what is now syria since ancient times 99 but more recent settlement in qamishli al-hasakah al-qahtaniyah al darbasiyah al-malikiyah amuda tel tamer and a few other small towns in al-hasakah governorate were populated by assyrians in the early 20th century after the assyrian genocide in 1914 when they were displaced from other areas of their homeland by the ottoman turks and kurdish tribes 100 during the 1930s and 1940s an influx of assyrians mainly those from northern iraq who were targeted during the simele massacre resettled in northeastern syrian villages mainly in tel tamer and smaller villages along the khabour river valley 101 the assyrians in syria did not have syrian citizenship and title to their land until late 1940s 102 sizable assyrian populations only remain in syria where an estimated 400,000 assyrians live 4 and in iraq where an estimated 300,000 assyrians live 49 in iran and turkey only small populations remain with only 20,000 assyrians in iran 9 10 and a small but growing assyrian population in turkey where 25,000 assyrians live the assyro-chaldean delegation s map of an independent assyria presented at the paris peace conference 1919 in tur abdin a traditional center of assyrian culture there are only 2,500 assyrians left 103 down from 50,000 in the 1960 census but up from 1,000 in 1992 this sharp decline is due to an intense conflict between turkey and the pkk in the 1980s however there are an estimated 25,000 assyrians in all of turkey with most living in istanbul 104 hakkari s assyrian population was ethnically cleansed during the assyrian genocide of the first world war those who survived fled to unaffected areas of assyrian settlement in syria iran and iraq many went to neighboring countries in and around the caucasus and middle east like armenia georgia southern russia lebanon jordan most assyrians currently reside in the west due to the centuries of persecution by the neighboring muslims assyrian subgroups there are three main assyrian subgroups eastern western chaldean these subdivisions range from fully or semi-overlapping linguistic historical cultural and religious similarities between each grouping the eastern subgroup historically inhabited the northern zagros mountains the nahla and sapna valleys in nuhadra and the nineveh and urmia plains speaking northeastern neo-aramaic languages they are religiously diverse adhering to the east syriac churches protestantism judaism or are irreligious the chaldean subgroup is a subset of the eastern one as they are traditionally speakers of northeastern neo-aramaic and belong to the east syriac rite while some today consider themselves as having a distinct chaldean identity or belonging to a distinct chaldean culture many chaldean catholics identify as assyrian or chaldo-assyrian 105 the western subgroup historically inhabited tur abdin and upper mesopotamia speaking central neo-aramaic languages most adhere to the west syriac churches but a number are irreligious map depicting assyrian relocation after seyfo in 1914 persecution due to their christian faith and ethnicity the assyrians have been persecuted since their adoption of christianity during the reign of yazdegerd i christians in persia were viewed with suspicion as potential roman subversives resulting in persecutions while at the same time promoting nestorian christianity as a buffer between the churches of rome and persia persecutions and attempts to impose zoroastrianism continued during the reign of yazdegerd ii 106 107 during the eras of mongol rule under genghis khan and timur there was indiscriminate slaughter of tens of thousands of assyrians and destruction of the assyrian population of northwestern iran and central and northern iran 108 more recent persecutions since the 19th century include the massacres of badr khan the massacres of diyarbak r 1895 the adana massacre the assyrian genocide the simele massacre and the al-anfal campaign diaspora assyrian world population more than 500,000 100,000 500,000 50,000 100,000 10,000 50,000 less than 10,000 since the assyrian genocide many assyrians have left the middle east entirely for a more safe and comfortable life in the countries of the western world as a result of this the assyrian population in the middle east has decreased dramatically as of today there are more assyrians in the diaspora than in their homeland the largest assyrian diaspora communities are found in sweden 100,000 109 germany 100,000 110 the united states 80,000 111 and in australia 46,000 112 by ethnic percentage the largest assyrian diaspora communities are located in s dert lje in stockholm county sweden and in fairfield city in sydney australia where they are the leading ethnic group in the suburbs of fairfield fairfield heights and greenfield park 113 114 115 there is also a sizable assyrian community in melbourne australia broadmeadows meadow heights and craigieburn 116 in the united states assyrians are mostly found in chicago niles and skokie detroit sterling heights and west bloomfield township phoenix modesto stanislaus county and turlock 117

assyrian communities are scattered throughout munich frankfurt stuttgart berlin and wiesbaden in paris france the commune of sarcelles has a small number of assyrians assyrians in the netherlands mainly live in the east of the country in the province of overijssel in russia small groups of assyrians mostly reside in krasnodar kray and moscow 29 to note the assyrians residing in california and russia tend to be from iran whilst those in chicago and sydney are predominantly iraqi assyrians the assyrians in detroit are primarily chaldean speakers who also originate from iraq assyrians in such european countries as sweden and germany would usually be turoyo-speakers or western assyrians 118 identity and subdivisions assyrian flag adopted in 1968 119 syriac-aramean flag 120 assyrians of the middle east and diaspora employ different terms for self-identification based on conflicting beliefs in the origin and identity of their respective communities 121 in certain areas of the assyrian homeland identity within a community depends on a person s village of origin see list of assyrian villages or christian denomination rather than their ethnic commonality for instance chaldean catholics preferring to be called chaldeans instead of assyrians or a syriac orthodox christian preferring to be called a syriac 122 during the 19th century english archaeologist austen henry layard believed that the syriac christian communities were descended from the ancient assyrians a view that was also shared by william ainger wigram 123 today assyrians and other minority ethnic groups in the middle east feel pressure to identify as arabs 124 125 turks and kurds 126 in addition western media often makes no mention of any ethnic identity of the christian people of the region and simply call them christians 127 iraqi christians iranian christians syrian christians and turkish christians a label rejected by assyrians self-designation below are terms commonly used by assyrians to self-identify assyrian named after the ancient assyrian people is advocated by followers from within all middle eastern based east and west syrian rite churches as a catch all term see syriac christianity 121 128 chaldean named after the ancient chaldean people is advocated by some followers of the chaldean catholic church 127 syriac named after the syriac language and as a corruption of syrian can be found advocated by followers of the western rite syriac orthodox church and syriac catholic church 127 aramean also known as west assyrian or syriac-aramean 129 named after the ancient aramean people is advocated by followers of the syriac orthodox church in syria 130 131 and some followers of syriac catholic church in israel 132 some scholars argue that the aramean identity has become predominant amongst followers of west syrian churches and has been partially merged with the syriac identification 129 assyrian vs syrian naming controversy as early as the 8th century bc luwian and cilician subject rulers referred to their assyrian overlords as syrian a western indo-european corruption of the original term assyrian this version of the name took hold in the hellenic lands to the west of the old assyrian empire thus during greek seleucid rule from 323 bc the name assyria was altered to syria and this term was also applied to aramea to the west which had been an assyrian colony when the seleucids lost control of assyria to the parthians they retained the corrupted term syria applying it to ancient aramea while the parthians called assyria assuristan a parthian form of the original name it is from this period that the syrian vs assyrian controversy arises today it is accepted by the majority of scholars that the medieval renaissance and victorian term syriac when used to describe the indigenous christians of mesopotamia and its immediate surrounds in effect means aramean 133 the modern terminological problem goes back to colonial times but it became more acute in 1946 when with the independence of syria the adjective syrian referred to an independent state the controversy isn t restricted to exonyms like english assyrian vs aramaean but also applies to self-designation in neo-aramaic the minority aramaean faction endorses both s ry y and r may while the majority assyrian faction insists on r y but also accepts s ry y however an increasing number of scholars as well as syriacs have begun to use aramean to refer to this distinct ethnicity as opposed to ethic assyrians since this is historically culturally and linguistically a more accurate term alqosh located in the midst of assyrian contemporary civilization the question of ethnic identity and self-designation is sometimes connected to the scholarly debate on the etymology of syria the question has a long history of academic controversy but majority mainstream opinion currently strongly favours that syria is indeed ultimately derived from the assyrian term a r yu 134 135 meanwhile some scholars has disclaimed the theory of syrian being derived from assyrian as simply naive and detracted its importance to the naming conflict 136 rudolf macuch points out that the eastern neo-aramaic press initially used the term syrian sury ta and only much later with the rise of nationalism switched to assyrian ator ta 137 according to tsereteli however a georgian equivalent of assyrians appears in ancient georgian armenian and russian documents 138 this correlates with the theory of the nations to the east of mesopotamia knew the group as assyrians while to the west beginning with greek influence the group was known as syrians syria being a greek corruption of assyria the debate appears to have been settled by the discovery of the inek y inscription in favour of syria being derived from assyria the inek y inscription is a hieroglyphic luwian-phoenician bilingual uncovered from inek y adana province turkey ancient cilicia dating to the 8th century bc originally published by tekoglu and lemaire 2000 139 it was more recently the subject of a 2006 paper published in the journal of near eastern studies in which the author robert rollinger lends support to the age-old debate of the name syria being derived from assyria see etymology of syria the object on which the inscription is found is a monument belonging to urikki vassal king of hiyawa i e cilicia dating to the eighth century bc in this monumental inscription urikki made reference to the relationship between his kingdom and his assyrian overlords the luwian inscription reads sura i whereas the phoenician translation reads r or ashur which according to rollinger 2006 settles the problem once and for all 140 culture assyrian child dressed in traditional clothes the assyrian dialects assyrian culture is largely influenced by christianity 141 main festivals occur during religious holidays such as easter and christmas there are also secular holidays such as kha b-nisan vernal equinox 142 people often greet and bid relatives farewell with a kiss on each cheek and by saying shlama shlomo lokh which means peace be upon you in neo-aramaic others are greeted with a handshake with the right hand only according to middle eastern customs the left hand is associated with evil similarly shoes may not be left facing up one may not have their feet facing anyone directly whistling at night is thought to waken evil spirits etc 143 there are many assyrian customs that are common in other middle eastern cultures a parent will often place an eye pendant on their baby to prevent an evil eye being cast upon it 144 spitting on anyone or their belongings is seen as a grave insult assyrians are endogamous meaning they generally marry within their own ethnic group although exogamous marriages are not perceived as a taboo not unless if the foreigner is of a different religious background especially a muslim 145 language the neo-aramaic languages are ultimately descended from late old eastern aramaic the lingua franca in the later phase of the neo-assyrian empire displacing the east semitic assyrian dialect of akkadian and sumerian aramaic was the language of commerce trade and communication and became the vernacular language of assyria in classical antiquity 146 147 148 by the 1st century ad akkadian was extinct although its influence on modern assyrian is significant and some loaned vocabulary still survives in assyrian neo-aramaic to this day 149 150 to the native speaker syriac is usually called soureth or suret a wide variety of languages and dialects exist including assyrian neo-aramaic chaldean neo-aramaic and turoyo minority dialects include senaya and bohtan neo-aramaic which are both near extinction all are classified as neo-aramaic languages and are written using syriac script a derivative of the ancient aramaic script jewish varieties such as lishanid noshan lish n did n and lishana deni written in the hebrew script are spoken by assyrian jews 151 152 153 there is a considerable amount of mutual intelligibility between assyrian neo-aramaic chaldean neo-aramaic senaya lishana deni and bohtan neo-aramaic therefore these languages would generally be considered to be dialects of assyrian neo-aramaic rather than separate languages the jewish aramaic languages of lishan didan and lishanid noshan share a partial intelligibility with these varieties the mutual intelligibility between the aforementioned languages and turoyo is depending on the dialect limited to partial and may be asymmetrical 151 154 155 being stateless assyrians are typically multilingual speaking both their native languages and those of the societies they reside in such as english arabic french german and swedish and historically turkish armenian azeri kurdish and persian many loanwords from the aforementioned languages also exist in the neo-aramaic languages in turkey istanbul and tur abdin northern syria and northern iraq turkish and kurdish are widely spoken but only turkey is reported to be experiencing a population increase of assyrians in the four countries constituting their historical homeland 156 script assyrians predominantly use the syriac script which is written from right to left it is one of the semitic abjads directly descending from the aramaic alphabet and shares similarities with the phoenician hebrew and the arabic alphabets 157 it has 22 letters representing consonants three of which can be also used to indicate vowels the vowel sounds are supplied either by the reader s memory or by optional diacritic marks syriac is a cursive script where some but not all letters connect within a word it was used to write the syriac language from the 1st century ad 158 the oldest and classical form of the alphabet is the es rang l script 159 although es rang l is no longer used as the main script for writing syriac it has received some revival since the 10th century and it has been added to the unicode standard in september 1999 the east syriac dialect is usually written in the ma n y form of the alphabet which is often translated as contemporary reflecting its use in writing modern neo-aramaic the west syriac dialect is usually written in the ser form of the alphabet most of the letters are clearly derived from es rang l but are simplified flowing lines 160 furthermore for practical reasons assyrian people would also use the latin alphabet especially in social media religion historical divisions within syriac christian churches in the middle east assyrians belong to various christian denominations such as the assyrian church of the east with an estimated 400,000 members 161 the chaldean catholic church with about 600,000 members 162 and the syriac orthodox church idto suryoyto tri a u o which has between 1,000,000 and 4,000,000 members around the world only some of whom are assyrians 163 the ancient church of the east with some 100,000 members a small minority of assyrians accepted the protestant reformation in the 20th century possibly due to british influences and is now organized in the assyrian evangelical church the assyrian pentecostal church and other protestant assyrian groups while assyrians are predominantly christians a number are irreligious many members of the following churches consider themselves assyrian ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion a legacy of the ottoman millet system the group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of syriac christianity and speaking neo-aramaic languages it is subdivided into adherents of the assyrian church of the east and ancient church of the east following the east syrian rite also known as nestorians adherents of the syriac orthodox church following the west syrian rite also known as jacobites adherents of the syriac catholic church following the west syrian rite for obvious reasons the chaldean catholics who follow the east syrian rite and were originally members of the historical church of the east are not nestorian in theology a designation which the church of the east itself denied baptism and first communion are celebrated extensively similar to a brit milah or bar mitzvah in jewish communities after a death a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person as of jesus after seven days another gathering commemorates their death a close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights or sometimes a year as a sign of mourning music traditional clothing may be worn in the assyrian folk dance assyrian music is a combination of traditional folk music and western contemporary music genres namely pop but also rap and recently edm instruments traditionally used by assyrians include the zurna and davula but has expanded to include guitars pianos violins synthesizers keyboards and electronic drums and other instruments some well known assyrian singers in modern times are ashur bet sargis sargon gabriel evin agassi janan sawa juliana jendo and linda george assyrian artists that traditionally sing in other languages include melechesh timz and aril brikha the first international aramaic music festival was held in lebanon in august 2008 for assyrian people internationally dance assyrians have numerous traditional dances which are performed mostly for special occasions such as weddings assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general near eastern elements assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of circle dances that are performed in a line which may be straight curved or both most of the dances allow unlimited number of participants with the exception of the sabre dance which require three at most assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong depending on the mood and tempo of a song festivals assyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their christian faith of which easter is the most prominent of the celebrations members of the assyrian church of the east chaldean catholic church and syriac catholic church follow the gregorian calendar and as a result celebrate easter on a sunday between march 22 and april 25 inclusively 164 however members of the syriac orthodox church and ancient church of the east celebrate easter on a sunday between april 4 and may 8 inclusively on the gregorian calendar march 22 and april 25 on the julian calendar during lent assyrians are encouraged to fast for 50 days from meat and any other foods which are animal based assyrians celebrate a number of festivals unique to their culture and traditions as well as religious ones kha b-nisan the assyrian new year traditionally on april 1 though usually celebrated on january 1 assyrians usually wear traditional costumes and hold social events including parades and parties dancing and listening to poets telling the story of creation 165 sauma d-ba utha the nineveh fast is a three-day period of fasting and prayer 166 somikka all saints day is celebrated to motivate children to fast during lent through use of frightening costumes kalu d sulaqa feast of the bride of the ascension celebrates assyrian resistance to the invasion of assyria by tamerlane nusardyl commemorating the baptism of the assyrians of urmia by st thomas 167 sharra d mart maryam usually on august 15 a festival and feast celebrating st mary with games food and celebration 167 other sharras special festivals include sharra d mart shmuni sharra d mar shimon bar-sabbaye sharra d mar mari and shara d mar zaia mar bishu mar sawa mar sliwa and mar odisho yoma d sah deh day of martyrs commemorating the thousands massacred in the simele massacre and the hundreds of thousands massacred in the assyrian genocide assyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies the rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years an assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week today weddings in the assyrian homeland usually last 2 3 days in the assyrian diaspora they last 1 2 days traditional clothing assyrian clothing varies from village to village clothing is usually blue red green yellow and purple these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing decoration is lavish in assyrian costumes and sometimes involves jewellery the conical hats of traditional assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient mesopotamia and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair beards and moustaches was still commonplace cuisine assyrian cuisine is similar to other middle eastern cuisines it is rich in grain meat potato cheese bread and tomato typically rice is served with every meal with a stew poured over it tea is a popular drink and there are several dishes of desserts snacks and beverages alcoholic drinks such as wine and wheat beer are organically produced and drank genetics late 20th century dna analysis conducted by cavalli-sforza paolo menozzi and alberto piazza shows that assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population 168 genetic analysis of the assyrians of persia demonstrated that they were closed with little intermixture with the muslim persian population and that an individual assyrian s genetic makeup is relatively close to that of the assyrian population as a whole 169 170 the genetic data are compatible with historical data that religion played a major role in maintaining the assyrian population s separate identity during the christian era 168 in a 2006 study of the y chromosome dna of six regional armenian populations including for comparison assyrians and syrians researchers found that the semitic populations assyrians and syrians are very distinct from each other according to both comparative axes this difference supported also by other methods of comparison points out the weak genetic affinity between the two populations with different historical destinies 171 a 2008 study on the genetics of old ethnic groups in mesopotamia including 340 subjects from seven ethnic communities assyrian jewish zoroastrian armenian turkmen the arab peoples in iran iraq and kuwait found that assyrians were homogeneous with respect to all other ethnic groups sampled in the study regardless of religious affiliation 172 in a 2011 study focusing on the genetics of marsh arabs of iraq researchers identified y chromosome haplotypes shared by marsh arabs iraqis and assyrians supporting a common local background 173 in a 2017 study focusing on the genetics of northern iraqi populations it was found that iraqi assyrians and iraqi yazidis clustered together but away from the other northern iraqi populations analyzed in the study and largely in between the west asian and southeastern european populations according to the study contemporary assyrians and yazidis from northern iraq may in fact have a stronger continuity with the original genetic stock of the mesopotamian people which possibly provided the basis for the ethnogenesis of various subsequent near eastern populations 174 see also assyria assyrian diaspora assyrian genocide assyrian homeland assyrian universal alliance neo-aramaic languages syriac
