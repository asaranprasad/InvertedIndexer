neoproterozoic events axis scale millions of years ago the neoproterozoic era is the unit of geologic time from million years ago 1 it is the last era of the precambrian supereon and the proterozoic eon it is subdivided into the tonian cryogenian and ediacaran periods it is preceded by the mesoproterozoic era and succeeded by the paleozoic era the most severe glaciation known in the geologic record occurred during the cryogenian when ice sheets reached the equator and formed a possible snowball earth the earliest fossils of multicellular life are found in the ediacaran including the ediacarans which were the earliest animals according to rino and co-workers the sum of the continental crust formed in the pan-african orogeny and the grenville orogeny makes the neoproterozoic the period of earth s history that has produced most continental crust 2 contents 1 geology 2 subdivisions 3 paleobiology 4 terminal period 5 see also 6 references 7 external links geology edit at the onset of the neoproterozoic the supercontinent rodinia which had assembled during the late mesoproterozoic straddled the equator during the tonian rifting commenced which broke rodinia into a number of individual land masses possibly as a consequence of the low-latitude position of most continents several large-scale glacial events occurred during the neoproterozoic era including the sturtian and marinoan glaciations of the cryogenian period these glaciations are believed to have been so severe that there were ice sheets at the equator a state known as the snowball earth subdivisions edit russian geologists divide the neoproterozoic of siberia into the baikalian from 850 to 650 ma loosely equivalent to the cryogenian which follows the mayanian from 1000 to 850 ma then the aimchanian 3 paleobiology edit the idea of the neoproterozoic era was introduced in the 1960s nineteenth-century paleontologists set the start of multicelled life at the first appearance of hard-shelled animals called trilobites and archeocyathid sponges this set the beginning of the cambrian period in the early 20th century paleontologists started finding fossils of multicellular animals that predated the start of the cambrian a complex fauna was found in south west africa in the 1920s but was inaccurately dated another fauna was found in south australia in the 1940s but was not thoroughly examined until the late 1950s other possible early fossils were found in russia england canada and elsewhere see ediacaran biota some were determined to be pseudofossils but others were revealed to be members of rather complex biotas that are still poorly understood at least 25 regions worldwide yielded metazoan fossils older than the classical cambrian boundary at million years ago 4 a few of the early animals appear possibly to be ancestors of modern animals most fall into ambiguous groups of frond-like organisms discoids that might be holdfasts for stalked organisms medusoids mattress-like forms small calcareous tubes and armored animals of unknown provenance these were most commonly known as vendian biota until the formal naming of the period and are currently known as ediacaran period biota most were soft bodied the relationships if any to modern forms are obscure some paleontologists relate many or most of these forms to modern animals others acknowledge a few possible or even likely relationships but feel that most of the ediacaran forms are representatives of unknown animal types in addition to ediacaran biota two other types of biota were discovered in china the doushantuo formation and hainan formation terminal period edit the nomenclature for the terminal period of the neoproterozoic era has been unstable russian and nordic geologists referred to the last period of the neoproterozoic as the vendian while chinese geologists referred to it as the sinian and most australians and north americans used the name ediacaran however in 2004 the international union of geological sciences ratified the ediacaran period to be a geological age of the neoproterozoic ranging from 635 to 541 million years ago 1 the ediacaran period boundaries are the only precambrian boundaries defined by biologic global boundary stratotype section and points rather than the absolute global standard stratigraphic ages see also edit boring billion references edit a b ogg james g
