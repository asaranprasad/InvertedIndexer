x-ray telescope - wikipedia x-ray telescope from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search international x-ray observatory concept an x-ray telescope xrt is a telescope that is designed to observe remote objects in the x-ray spectrum in order to get above the earth s atmosphere which is opaque to x-rays x-ray telescopes must be mounted on high altitude rockets balloons or artificial satellites the basic elements of the telescope are the optics focusing or collimating that collects the radiation entering the telescope and the detector on which the radiation is collected and measured a variety of different designs and technologies have been used for these elements many of the existing telescopes on satellites are compounded of multiple copies or variations of a detector-telescope system whose capabilities add or complement each other and additional fixed or removable elements 1 2 filters spectrometers that add functionalities to the instrument contents 1

most common methods used in x-ray optics are grazing incidence mirrors and collimated apertures focusing mirrors edit nustar has captured these first focused views of the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy in high-energy x-ray light the utilization of x-ray mirrors allows to focus the incident radiation on the detector plane different geometries e g kirkpartick-baez or lobster-eye have been suggested or employed but almost the totality of existing telescopes employs some variation of the wolter i design the limitations of this type of x-ray optics result in much narrower fields of view typically 1 degree than visible or uv telescopes with respect to collimated optics focusing optics allow a high resolution imaging a high telescope sensitivity since radiation is focused on a small area signal-to-noise ratio is much higher for this kind of instruments the mirrors can be made of ceramic or metal foil 3 coated with a thin layer of a reflective material typically gold or iridium mirrors based on this construction work on the basis of total reflection of light at grazing incidence this technology is limited in energy range by the inverse relation between critical angle for total reflection and radiation energy the limit in the early 2000s with chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observatories was about 15 kilo-electronvolt kev light 4 using new multi-layered coated mirrors the x-ray mirror for the nustar telescope pushed this up to 79 kev light 4 to reflect at this level glass layers were multi-coated with tungsten w silicon si or platinum pt silicon carbide sic 4 collimating optics edit while earlier x-ray telescopes were using simple collimating techniques e g rotating collimators wire collimators 5 the technology most currently used on present days employs coded aperture masks this technique uses a flat aperture patterned grille in front of the detector this design results less sensitive than focusing optics and imaging quality and identification of source position is much poorer however it offers a larger field of view and can be employed at higher energies where grazing incidence optics become ineffective also the imaging is not direct but the image is rather reconstructed by post-processing of the signal detectors edit several technologies have been employed on detectors for x-ray telescopes ranging from counters like ionization chambers geiger counters or scintillators to imaging detectors like ccds or cmos sensors the use of micro-calorimeters that offer the added capability of measuring with great accuracy the energy of the radiation is planned for future missions missions employing x-ray telescopes edit sigma instrument art-p instrument the layout of the swift xrt sounding rocket 36.049 carrying the mssta

the xrt on the swift midex mission 0.2 10 kev energy range uses a wolter i telescope to focus x-rays onto a thermoelectrically cooled ccd 12 it was designed to measure the fluxes spectra and lightcurves of gamma-ray bursts grbs and afterglows over a wide dynamic range covering more than 7 orders of magnitude in flux the xrt can pinpoint grbs to 5-arcsec accuracy within 10 seconds of target acquisition for a typical grb and can study the x-ray counterparts of grbs beginning 20 70 seconds from burst discovery and continuing for days to weeks the overall telescope length is 4.67 m

made of graphite fiber cyanate ester in two sections the outer graphite fiber layup is designed to minimize the longitudinal coefficient of thermal expansion whereas the inner composite tube is lined internally with an aluminum foil vapor barrier to guard against outgassing of water vapor or epoxy contaminants into the telescope interior 12 the telescope has a forward tube which encloses the mirrors and supports the door assembly and star trackers and an aft tube which supports the focal plane camera and internal optical baffles 12 the mirror module consists of 12 nested wolter i grazing
