photosphere - wikipedia photosphere from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the structure of the sun a g-type star core radiation zone convection zone photosphere chromosphere corona sunspot granules prominence not labelled solar wind the photosphere is a star s outer shell from which light is radiated the term itself is derived from ancient greek roots phos photos meaning light and sphaira meaning sphere in reference to it being a spherical surface that is perceived to emit light it extends into a star s surface until the plasma becomes opaque equivalent to an optical depth of approximately 2 3 1 in other words a photosphere is the deepest region of a luminous object usually a star that is transparent to photons of certain wavelengths contents 1 temperature 2 composition 3 sun 4 other layers 5 references 6 external links temperature edit the surface of a star is defined to have a temperature given by the effective temperature in the stefan boltzmann law stars except neutron stars have no solid surface 2 therefore the photosphere is typically used to describe the sun s or another star s visual surface composition edit the sun is composed primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium they account for 74.9 and 23.8 of the mass of the sun in the photosphere respectively all heavier elements called metals in astronomy account for less than 2 of the mass with oxygen roughly 1 of the sun s mass carbon 0.3 neon 0.2 and iron 0.2 being the most abundant sun edit solar atmosphere temperature and density see here for meanings of extra lines in the graph the sun s photosphere has a temperature between 4,500 and 6,000 k 4,230 and 5,730 c 3 with an effective temperature of 5,777 k 5,504 c 4 and a density of about 1 10 12 kg m3 5 other stars may have hotter or cooler photospheres the sun s photosphere is composed of convection cells called granules cells of plasma each approximately 1000 kilometers in diameter 6 with hot rising plasma in the center and cooler plasma falling in the narrow spaces between them each granule has a lifespan of only about eight minutes resulting in a continually shifting boiling pattern grouping the typical granules are super granules up to 30,000 kilometers in diameter with lifespans of up to 24 hours these details are too fine to see on other stars other layers edit the sun s visible atmosphere has other layers above the photosphere the 2,000 kilometer-deep chromosphere typically observed by filtered light for example h-alpha lies just between the photosphere and the much hotter but more tenuous corona other surface features on the photosphere are solar flares and sunspots references edit carroll ostlie 1996 modern astrophysics addison-wesley as of 2004 although white dwarfs are believed to crystallize from the middle out none have fully solidified yet 1 and only neutron stars are believed to have a solid albeit unstable 2 crust 3 nasa external links edit university of south wales university of south wales mps retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title photosphere oldid 828202109 categories stellar astronomy sun light sources hidden categories pages using div col with deprecated parameters navigation menu search this page was last edited on 1 march 2018 at 03 58 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
