magnetosphere - wikipedia magnetosphere from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search play media a rendering of the magnetic field lines of earth s magnetosphere a magnetosphere is the region of space surrounding an astronomical object in which charged particles are manipulated or affected by that object s magnetic field 1 2 it is created by planets having active hot iron and nickle or metallic cores whose motion generated a planetary magnetic field but such fields can also occur in stars by the interactions of plasma near the surfaces of many astronomical objects magnetic fields resembles a magnetic dipole where field lines extending farther away from the surface can be significantly distorted flowing electrically conducting plasma as emitted from the sun or a nearby star e g the solar wind 3 4 planets having active magnetospheres like the earth are capable of mitigating or blocking the effects of solar radiation or cosmic radiation that also protects all living organisms from potentially detrimental and dangerous consequences this is studied under the specialised scientific subjects of plasma physics space physics and aeronomy contents 1 history 2 structure

magnetosphere began in 1600 when william gilbert discovered that the magnetic field on the surface of earth resembled that on a terrella a small magnetized sphere in the 1940s walter m elsasser proposed the model of dynamo theory which attributes earth s magnetic field to the motion of earth s iron outer core through the use of magnetometers scientists were able to study the variations in earth s magnetic field as functions of both time and latitude and longitude beginning in the late 1940s rockets were used to study cosmic rays in 1958 explorer 1 the first of the explorer series of space missions was launched to study the intensity of cosmic rays above the atmosphere and measure the fluctuations in this activity this mission observed the existence of the van allen radiation belt located in the inner region of earth s magnetosphere with the follow up explorer 3 later that year definitively proving its existence also during 1958 eugene parker proposed the idea of the solar wind with the term magnetosphere being proposed by thomas gold in 1959 to explain how the solar wind interacted with the earth s magnetic field the later mission of explorer 12 in 1961 led by the cahill and amazeen observation in 1963 of a sudden decrease in magnetic field strength near the noon-time meridian later was named the magnetopause by 1983 the international cometary explorer observed the magnetotail or the distant magnetic field 4 structure and behavior edit magnetospheres are dependent on several variables the type of astronomical object the nature of sources of plasma and momentum the period of the object s spin the nature of the axis about which the object spins the axis of the magnetic dipole and the magnitude and direction of the flow of solar wind the planetary distance where the magnetosphere can withstand the solar wind pressure is called the chapman ferraro distance this is usefully modeled by the formula wherein r p displaystyle r p represents the radius of the planet b s u r f displaystyle b surf represents the magnetic field on the surface of the planet at the equator and v s w displaystyle v sw represents the velocity of the solar wind r c f r p b s u r f

opposition to the flow of solar wind is the magnetic field of the object mercury earth jupiter ganymede saturn uranus and neptune for example exhibit intrinsic magnetospheres a magnetosphere is classified as induced when r c f r p displaystyle r cf ll r p or when the solar wind is not opposed by the object s magnetic field in this case the solar wind interacts with the atmosphere or ionosphere of the planet or surface of the planet if the planet has no atmosphere venus has an induced magnetic field which means that because venus appears to have no internal dynamo effect the only magnetic field present is that formed by the solar wind s wrapping around the physical obstacle of venus see also venus induced magnetosphere when r c f r p displaystyle r cf approx r p the planet itself and its magnetic field both contribute it is possible that mars is of this type 5 structure edit an artist s rendering of the structure of a magnetosphere 1 bow shock 2 magnetosheath 3 magnetopause 4 magnetosphere 5 northern tail lobe 6 southern tail lobe 7 plasmasphere bow shock edit infrared image and artist s concept of the bow shock around r hydrae the bow shock forms the outermost layer of the magnetosphere the boundary between the magnetosphere and the ambient medium for stars this is usually the boundary between the stellar wind and interstellar medium for planets the speed of the solar wind there decreases as it approaches the magnetopause 6 magnetosheath edit the magnetosheath is the region of the magnetosphere between the bow shock and the magnetopause it is formed mainly from shocked solar wind though it contains a small amount of plasma from the magnetosphere 7 it is an area exhibiting high particle energy flux where the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field varies erratically this is caused by the collection of solar wind gas that has effectively undergone thermalization it acts as a cushion that transmits the pressure from the flow of the solar wind and the barrier of the magnetic field from the object 4 magnetopause edit the magnetopause is the area of the magnetosphere wherein the pressure from the planetary magnetic field is balanced with the pressure from the solar wind 3 it is the convergence of the shocked solar wind from the magnetosheath with the magnetic field of the object and plasma from the magnetosphere because both sides of this convergence contain magnetized plasma the interactions between them are complex the structure of the magnetopause depends upon the mach number and beta of the plasma as well as the magnetic field 8 the magnetopause changes size and shape as the pressure from the solar wind fluctuates 9 magnetotail edit opposite the compressed magnetic field is the magnetotail where the magnetosphere extends far beyond the astronomical object it contains two lobes referred to as the northern and southern tail lobes magnetic field lines in the northern tail lobe point towards the object while those in the southern tail lobe point away the tail lobes are almost empty with few charged particles opposing the flow of the solar wind the two lobes are separated by a plasma sheet an area where the magnetic field is weaker and the density of charged particles is higher 10 earth s magnetosphere edit artist s rendition of earth s magnetosphere diagram of earth s magnetosphere over earth s equator the magnetic field lines become almost horizontal then return to reconnect at high latitudes however at high altitudes the magnetic field is significantly distorted by the solar wind and its solar magnetic field on the dayside of earth the magnetic field is significantly compressed by the solar wind to a distance of approximately 65,000 kilometers 40,000 mi earth s bow shock is about 17 kilometers 11 mi thick 11 and located about 90,000 kilometers 56,000 mi from earth 12 the magnetopause exists at a distance of several hundred kilometers above earth s surface earth s magnetopause has been compared to a sieve because it allows solar wind particles to enter kelvin helmholtz instabilities occur when large swirls of plasma travel along the edge of the magnetosphere at a different velocity from the magnetosphere causing the plasma to slip past this results in magnetic reconnection and as the magnetic field lines break and reconnect solar wind particles are able to enter the magnetosphere 13 on earth s nightside the magnetic field extends in the magnetotail which lengthwise exceeds 6,300,000 kilometers 3,900,000 mi 3 earth s magnetotail is the primary source of the polar aurora 10 also nasa scientists have suggested that earth s magnetotail might cause dust storms on the moon by creating a potential difference between the day side and the night side 14 other objects edit the magnetosphere of jupiter is the largest planetary magnetosphere in the solar system extending up to 7,000,000 kilometers 4,300,000 mi on the dayside and almost to the orbit of saturn on the nightside 15 jupiter s magnetosphere is stronger than earth s by an order of magnitude and its magnetic moment is approximately 18,000 times larger 16 pluto on the other hand has no magnetic field 17 see also edit geomagnetism wikipedia book plasma physics references edit nasa science nasa ratcliffe john ashworth 1972 cup archive isbn 9780521083416 a b c encyclop dia britannica encyclop
