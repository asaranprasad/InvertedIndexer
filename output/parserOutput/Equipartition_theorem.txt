random and complex and the energy of any particular atom can fluctuate wildly nevertheless the equipartition theorem allows the average kinetic energy of each atom to be computed as well as the average potential energies of many vibrational modes the grey red and blue spheres represent atoms of carbon oxygen and nitrogen respectively the smaller white spheres represent atoms of hydrogen in classical statistical mechanics the equipartition theorem relates the temperature of a system to its average energies the equipartition theorem is also known as the law of equipartition equipartition of energy or simply equipartition the original idea of equipartition was that in thermal equilibrium energy is shared equally among all of its various forms for example the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom in translational motion of a molecule should equal that in rotational motion the equipartition theorem makes quantitative predictions like the virial theorem it gives the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature from which the system s heat capacity can be computed however equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single spring for example it predicts that every atom in a monatomic ideal gas has an average kinetic energy of 3 2 kbt in thermal equilibrium where kb is the boltzmann constant and t is the thermodynamic temperature more generally equipartition can be applied to any classical system in thermal equilibrium no matter how complicated it can be used to derive the ideal gas law and the dulong petit law for the specific heat capacities of solids the equipartition theorem can also be used to predict the properties of stars even white dwarfs and neutron stars since it holds even when relativistic effects are considered although the equipartition theorem makes accurate predictions in certain conditions it is inaccurate when quantum effects are significant such as at low temperatures when the thermal energy kbt is smaller than the quantum energy spacing in a particular degree of freedom the average energy and heat capacity of this degree of freedom are less than the values predicted by equipartition such a degree of freedom is said to be frozen out when the thermal energy is much smaller than this spacing for example the heat capacity of a solid decreases at low temperatures as various types of motion become frozen out rather than remaining constant as predicted by equipartition such decreases in heat capacity were among the first signs to physicists of the 19th century that classical physics was incorrect and that a new more subtle scientific model was required along with other evidence equipartition s failure to model black-body radiation also known as the ultraviolet catastrophe led max planck to suggest that energy in the oscillators in an object which emit light were quantized a revolutionary hypothesis that spurred the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory contents 1 basic concept and simple examples 1.1 translational energy

c the four gases are helium 4he neon 20ne argon 40ar and xenon 132xe the superscripts indicate their mass numbers these probability density functions have dimensions of probability times inverse speed since probability is dimensionless they can be expressed in units of seconds per meter the name equipartition means equal division as derived from the latin equi from the antecedent quus equal or even and partition from the noun partitio division portion 1 2 the original concept of equipartition was that the total kinetic energy of a system is shared equally among all of its independent parts on the average once the system has reached thermal equilibrium equipartition also makes quantitative predictions for these energies for example it predicts that every atom of an inert noble gas in thermal equilibrium at temperature t has an average translational kinetic energy of 3 2 kbt where kb is the boltzmann constant as a consequence since kinetic energy is equal to 1 2 mass velocity 2 the heavier atoms of xenon have a lower average speed than do the lighter atoms of helium at the same temperature figure 2 shows the maxwell boltzmann distribution for the speeds of the atoms in four noble gases in this example the key point is that the kinetic energy is quadratic in the velocity the equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium any degree of freedom such as a component of the position or velocity of a particle which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of 1 2kbt and therefore contributes 1 2kb to the system s heat capacity this has many applications translational energy and ideal gases edit the newtonian kinetic energy of a particle of mass m velocity v is given by h kin 1 2 m v 2 1 2 m v x 2 v y 2 v z 2 displaystyle h text kin tfrac 1 2 m mathbf v 2 tfrac 1 2 m left v x 2 v y 2 v z 2 right where vx vy and vz are the cartesian components of the velocity v here h is short for hamiltonian and used henceforth as a symbol for energy because the hamiltonian formalism plays a central role in the most general form of the equipartition theorem since the kinetic energy is quadratic in the components of the velocity by equipartition these three components each contribute 1 2kbt to the average kinetic energy in thermal equilibrium thus the average kinetic energy of the particle is 3 2 kbt as in the example of noble gases above more generally in an ideal gas the total energy consists purely of translational kinetic energy by assumption the particles have no internal degrees of freedom and move independently of one another equipartition therefore predicts that the average total energy of an ideal gas of n particles is 3 2 n kb t it follows that the heat capacity of the gas is 3 2 n kb and hence in particular the heat capacity of a mole of such gas particles is 3 2 nakb 3 2 r where na is the avogadro constant and r is the gas constant since r 2 cal mol k equipartition predicts that the molar heat capacity of an ideal gas is roughly 3 cal mol k this prediction is confirmed by experiment 3 the mean kinetic energy also allows the root mean square speed vrms of the gas particles to be calculated v rms v 2 3 k b t m 3 r t m displaystyle v text rms sqrt langle v 2 rangle sqrt frac 3k b t m sqrt frac 3rt m where m nam is the mass of a mole of gas particles this result is useful for many applications such as graham s law of effusion which provides a method for enriching uranium 4 rotational energy and molecular tumbling in solution edit a similar example is provided by a rotating molecule with principal moments of inertia i1 i2 and i3 the rotational energy of such a molecule is given by h r o t 1 2 i 1 1 2 i 2 2 2 i 3 3 2 displaystyle h mathrm rot tfrac 1 2 i 1 omega 1 2 i 2 omega 2 2 i 3 omega 3 2 where 1 2 and 3 are the principal components of the angular velocity by exactly the same reasoning as in the translational case equipartition implies that in thermal equilibrium the average rotational energy of each particle is 3 2 kbt similarly the equipartition theorem allows the average more precisely the root mean square angular speed of the molecules to be calculated 5 the tumbling of rigid molecules that is the random rotations of molecules in solution plays a key role in the relaxations observed by nuclear magnetic resonance particularly protein nmr and residual dipolar couplings 6 rotational diffusion can also be observed by other biophysical probes such as fluorescence anisotropy flow birefringence and dielectric spectroscopy 7 potential energy and harmonic oscillators edit equipartition applies to potential energies as well as kinetic energies important examples include harmonic oscillators such as a spring which has a quadratic potential energy h pot 1 2 a q 2 displaystyle h text pot tfrac 1 2 aq 2 where the constant a describes the stiffness of the spring and q is the deviation from equilibrium if such a one-dimensional system has mass m then its kinetic energy hkin is h kin 1 2 m v 2 p 2 2 m displaystyle h text kin frac 1 2 mv 2 frac p 2 2m where v and p mv denote the velocity and momentum of the oscillator combining these terms yields the total energy 8 h h kin h pot p 2 2 m 1 2 a q 2 displaystyle h h text kin h text pot frac p 2 2m frac 1 2 aq 2 equipartition therefore implies that in thermal equilibrium the oscillator has average energy h h kin h pot 1 2 k b t 1 2 k b t k b t displaystyle langle h rangle langle h text kin rangle langle h text pot rangle tfrac 1 2 k b t tfrac 1 2 k b t k b t where the angular brackets displaystyle left langle ldots right rangle denote the average of the enclosed quantity 9 this result is valid for any type of harmonic oscillator such as a pendulum a vibrating molecule or a passive electronic oscillator systems of such oscillators arise in many situations by equipartition each such oscillator receives an average total energy kbt and hence contributes kb to the system s heat capacity this can be used to derive the formula for johnson nyquist noise 10 and the dulong petit law of solid heat capacities the latter application was particularly significant in the history of equipartition figure 3 atoms in a crystal can vibrate about their equilibrium positions in the lattice such vibrations account largely for the heat capacity of crystalline dielectrics with metals electrons also contribute to the heat capacity specific heat capacity of solids edit for more details on the molar specific heat capacities of solids see einstein solid and debye model an important application of the equipartition theorem is to the specific heat capacity of a crystalline solid each atom in such a solid can oscillate in three independent directions so the solid can be viewed as a system of 3n independent simple harmonic oscillators where n denotes the number of atoms in the lattice since each harmonic oscillator has average energy kbt the average total energy of the solid is 3nkbt and its heat capacity is 3nkb by taking n to be the avogadro constant na and using the relation r nakb between the gas constant r and the boltzmann constant kb this provides an explanation for the dulong petit law of specific heat capacities of solids which stated that the specific heat capacity per unit mass of a solid element is inversely proportional to its atomic weight a modern version is that the molar heat capacity of a solid is 3r 6 cal mol k however this law is inaccurate at lower temperatures due to quantum effects it is also inconsistent with the experimentally derived third law of thermodynamics according to which the molar heat capacity of any substance must go to zero as the temperature goes to absolute zero 10 a more accurate theory incorporating quantum effects was developed by albert einstein 1907 and peter debye 1911 11 many other physical systems can be modeled as sets of coupled oscillators the motions of such oscillators can be decomposed into normal modes like the vibrational modes of a piano string or the resonances of an organ pipe on the other hand equipartition often breaks down for such systems because there is no exchange of energy between the normal modes in an extreme situation the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved this shows that some sort of mixing of energies formally called ergodicity is important for the law of equipartition to hold sedimentation of particles edit potential energies are not always quadratic in the position however the equipartition theorem also shows that if a degree of freedom x contributes only a multiple of xs for a fixed real number s to the energy then in thermal equilibrium the average energy of that part is kbt s there is a simple application of this extension to the sedimentation of particles under gravity 12 for example the haze sometimes seen in beer can be caused by clumps of proteins that scatter light 13 over time these clumps settle downwards under the influence of gravity causing more haze near the bottom of a bottle than near its top however in a process working in the opposite direction the particles also diffuse back up towards the top of the bottle once equilibrium has been reached the equipartition theorem may be used to determine the average position of a particular clump of buoyant mass mb for an infinitely tall bottle of beer the gravitational potential energy is given by h g r a v m b g z displaystyle h mathrm grav m rm b gz where z is the height of the protein clump in the bottle and g is the acceleration due to gravity since s 1 the average potential energy of a protein clump equals kbt hence a protein clump with a buoyant mass of 10 mda roughly the size of a virus would produce a haze with an average height of about 2 cm at equilibrium the process of such sedimentation to equilibrium is described by the mason weaver equation 14 history edit this article uses the non-si unit of cal mol k for heat capacity because it offers greater accuracy for single digits for an approximate conversion to the corresponding si unit of j mol k such values should be multiplied by 4.2 j cal the equipartition of kinetic energy was proposed initially in 1843 and more correctly in 1845 by john james waterston 15 in 1859 james clerk maxwell argued that the kinetic heat energy of a gas is equally divided between linear and rotational energy 16 in 1876 ludwig boltzmann expanded on this principle by showing that the average energy was divided equally among all the independent components of motion in a system 17 18 boltzmann applied the equipartition theorem to provide a theoretical explanation of the dulong petit law for the specific heat capacities of solids figure 4 idealized plot of the molar specific heat of a diatomic gas against temperature it agrees with the value 7 2 r predicted by equipartition at high temperatures where r is the gas constant but decreases to 5 2 r and then 3 2 r at lower temperatures as the vibrational and rotational modes of motion are frozen out the failure of the equipartition theorem led to a paradox that was only resolved by quantum mechanics for most molecules the transitional temperature t rot is much less than room temperature whereas t vib can be ten times larger or more a typical example is carbon monoxide co for which t rot 2.8 k and t vib 3103 k for molecules with very large or weakly bound atoms t vib can be close to room temperature about 300 k for example t vib 308 k for iodine gas i 2 19 the history of the equipartition theorem is intertwined with that of specific heat capacity both of which were studied in the 19th century in 1819 the french physicists pierre louis dulong and alexis th r se petit discovered that the specific heat capacities of solid elements at room temperature were inversely proportional to the atomic weight of the element 20 their law was used for many years as a technique for measuring atomic weights 11 however subsequent studies by james dewar and heinrich friedrich weber showed that this dulong petit law holds only at high temperatures 21 at lower temperatures or for exceptionally hard solids such as diamond the specific heat capacity was lower 22 experimental observations of the specific heat capacities of gases also raised concerns about the validity of the equipartition theorem the theorem predicts that the molar heat capacity of simple monatomic gases should be roughly 3 cal mol k whereas that of diatomic gases should be roughly 7 cal mol k experiments confirmed the former prediction 3 but found that molar heat capacities of diatomic gases were typically about 5 cal mol k 23 and fell to about 3 cal mol k at very low temperatures 24 maxwell noted in 1875 that the disagreement between experiment and the equipartition theorem was much worse than even these numbers suggest 25 since atoms have internal parts heat energy should go into the motion of these internal parts making the predicted specific heats of monatomic and diatomic gases much higher than 3 cal mol k and 7 cal mol k respectively a third discrepancy concerned the specific heat of metals 26 according to the classical drude model metallic electrons act as a nearly ideal gas and so they should contribute 3 2 nekb to the heat capacity by the equipartition theorem where ne is the number of electrons experimentally however electrons contribute little to the heat capacity the molar heat capacities of many conductors and insulators are nearly the same 26 several explanations of equipartition s failure to account for molar heat capacities were proposed boltzmann defended the derivation of his equipartition theorem as correct but suggested that gases might not be in thermal equilibrium because of their interactions with the aether 27 lord kelvin suggested that the derivation of the equipartition theorem must be incorrect since it disagreed with experiment but was unable to show how 28 in 1900 lord rayleigh instead put forward a more radical view that the equipartition theorem and the experimental assumption of thermal equilibrium were both correct to reconcile them he noted the need for a new principle that would provide an escape from the destructive simplicity of the equipartition theorem 29 albert einstein provided that escape by showing in 1906 that these anomalies in the specific heat were due to quantum effects specifically the quantization of energy in the elastic modes of the solid 30 einstein used the failure of equipartition to argue for the need of a new quantum theory of matter 11 nernst s 1910 measurements of specific heats at low temperatures 31 supported einstein s theory and led to the widespread acceptance of quantum theory among physicists 32 general formulation of the equipartition theorem edit the most general form of the equipartition theorem states that under suitable assumptions discussed below for a physical system with hamiltonian energy function h and degrees of freedom xn the following equipartition formula holds in thermal equilibrium for all indices m and n 5 9 12 x m h x n m n k b t displaystyle bigl langle x m frac

assumed to be an ensemble average over phase space or under an assumption of ergodicity a time average of a single system the general equipartition theorem holds in both the microcanonical ensemble 9 when the total energy of the system is constant and also in the canonical ensemble 5 33 when the system is coupled to a heat bath with which it can exchange energy derivations of the general formula are given later in the article the general formula is equivalent to the following two x n h x n k b t for all n displaystyle bigl langle x n frac partial h partial x n bigr rangle k b t quad mbox for all n x m h x n 0 for all m n displaystyle bigl langle x m frac partial h partial x n bigr rangle 0 quad mbox for all m neq n if a degree of freedom xn appears only as a quadratic term anxn2 in the

twice the contribution that this degree of freedom makes to the average energy h displaystyle langle h rangle thus the equipartition theorem for systems with quadratic energies follows easily from the general formula a similar argument with 2 replaced by s applies to energies of the form anxns the degrees of freedom xn are coordinates on the phase space of the system and are therefore commonly

another difference is that traditional derivations of the virial theorem use averages over time whereas those of the equipartition theorem use averages over phase space applications edit ideal gas law

energy the same results can be obtained by an alternative method using the partition function 35 diatomic gases edit a diatomic gas can be modelled as two masses m1 and m2 joined by a spring of stiffness a which is called the rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation 19 the classical energy of this system is h p 1 2 2 m 1 p 2 2 2 m 2 1 2 a q 2 displaystyle h frac left mathbf p 1 right 2 2m 1 frac left mathbf p 2 right 2 2m 2 frac 1 2 aq 2 where p1 and p2 are the momenta of the two atoms and q is the deviation of the inter-atomic separation from its equilibrium value every degree of freedom in the energy is quadratic and thus should contribute 1 2kbt to the total average energy and 1 2kb to the heat capacity therefore the heat capacity of a gas of n diatomic molecules is predicted to be 7n 1 2kb the momenta p1 and p2 contribute three degrees of freedom each and the extension q contributes the seventh it follows that the heat capacity of a mole of diatomic molecules with no other degrees of freedom should be 7 2 nakb 7 2 r and thus the predicted molar heat capacity should be roughly 7 cal mol k however the experimental values for molar heat capacities of diatomic gases are typically about 5 cal mol k 23 and fall to 3 cal mol k at very low temperatures 24 this disagreement between the equipartition prediction and the experimental value of the molar heat capacity cannot be explained by using a more complex model of the molecule since adding more degrees of freedom can only increase the predicted specific heat not decrease it 25 this discrepancy was a key piece of evidence showing the need for a quantum theory of matter figure 6 a combined x-ray and optical image of the crab nebula at the heart of this nebula there is a rapidly rotating neutron star which has about one and a half times the mass of the sun but is only 25 km across the equipartition theorem is useful in predicting the properties of such neutron stars extreme relativistic ideal gases edit equipartition was used above to derive the classical ideal gas law from newtonian mechanics however relativistic effects become dominant in some systems such as white dwarfs and neutron stars 9 and the ideal gas equations must be modified the equipartition theorem provides a convenient way to derive the corresponding laws for an extreme relativistic ideal gas 5 in such cases the

energy of an extreme relativistic gas is twice that of the non-relativistic case for n particles it is 3 nkbt non-ideal gases edit in an ideal gas the particles are assumed to interact only through collisions the equipartition theorem may also be used to derive the energy and pressure of non-ideal gases in which the particles also interact with one another through conservative forces whose potential u r depends only on the distance r between the particles 5 this situation can be described by first restricting attention to a single gas particle and approximating the rest of the gas by a spherically symmetric distribution it is then customary to introduce a radial distribution function g r such that the probability density of finding another particle at a distance r from the given particle is equal to 4 r2 g r where n v is the mean density of the gas 36 it follows that the mean potential energy associated to the interaction of the given particle with the rest of the gas is h p

motion of a particle in three dimensions the equipartition theorem can be used to derive the brownian motion of a particle from the langevin equation 5 according to that equation the motion of a

theorem have long been used as a tool in astrophysics 39 as examples the virial theorem may be used to estimate stellar temperatures or the chandrasekhar limit on the mass of white dwarf stars 40 41 the average temperature of a star can be estimated from the equipartition theorem 42 since most stars are spherically symmetric the total gravitational potential energy can be estimated by integration

kelvins however the sun is much more complex than assumed by this model both its temperature and density vary strongly with radius and such excellent agreement 7 relative error is partly fortuitous 43 star formation edit the same formulae may be applied to determining the conditions for star formation in giant molecular clouds 44 a local fluctuation in the density of such a cloud can lead to a runaway condition in which the cloud collapses inwards under its own gravity such a collapse occurs when the equipartition theorem or equivalently the virial theorem is no longer valid i e when the

instability after the british physicist james hopwood jeans who published it in 1902 45 derivations edit kinetic energies and the maxwell boltzmann distribution edit the original formulation of the equipartition theorem states that in any physical system in thermal equilibrium every particle has exactly the same average kinetic energy 3 2 kbt 46 this may be shown using the maxwell boltzmann

mathbf v v x v y v z the maxwell boltzmann distribution applies to any system composed of atoms and assumes only a canonical ensemble specifically that the kinetic energies are distributed according to their boltzmann factor at a temperature t 46 the average kinetic energy for a particle of mass m is then given by the integral formula h k i n 1 2 m v 2 0 1 2 m v 2 f v d v 3 2 k b t displaystyle

the particle energy using the probability of finding the particle in certain quantum energy state 35 quadratic energies and the partition function edit more generally the equipartition theorem states that any degree of freedom x which appears in the total energy h only as a simple quadratic term ax2 where a is a constant has an average energy of kbt in thermal equilibrium in this case the equipartition theorem may be derived from the partition function z where 1 kbt is the canonical inverse temperature 47 integration over the variable x yields a factor z x d x e a x 2 a displaystyle z

statistical mechanics textbooks both for the microcanonical ensemble 5 9 and for the canonical ensemble 5 33 they involve taking averages over the phase space of the system which is a symplectic manifold to explain these derivations the following notation is introduced first the phase space is described in terms of generalized position coordinates qj together with their conjugate momenta pj the quantities qj completely describe the configuration of the system while the quantities qj pj together completely describe its state secondly the infinitesimal volume d i d q i d p i displaystyle d

symbolized by displaystyle langle ldots rangle is the ensemble average taken over the canonical ensemble the microcanonical ensemble edit in the microcanonical ensemble the system is isolated from the rest of the world or at least very weakly coupled to it 9 hence its total energy is effectively constant to be definite we say that the total energy h is confined between e and e de for a given energy e and spread de there is a region of phase space in which the system has that energy and the probability of each state in that region of phase space is equal by the definition of the microcanonical ensemble given these definitions the equipartition average of phase-space variables xm which could be either qkor pk and xn is given by x m h x n 1 h e e e x m h x n d e e h e x m h x n d 1 e h e x m

limitations edit figure 9 energy is not shared among the various normal modes in an isolated system of ideal coupled oscillators the energy in each mode is constant and independent of the energy in the other modes hence the equipartition theorem does not hold for such a system in the microcanonical ensemble when isolated although it does hold in the canonical ensemble when coupled to a heat bath however by adding a sufficiently strong nonlinear coupling between the modes energy will be shared and equipartition holds in both ensembles requirement of ergodicity edit the law of equipartition holds only for ergodic systems in thermal equilibrium which implies that all states with the same energy must be equally likely to be populated 9 consequently it must be possible to exchange energy among all its various forms within the system or with an external heat bath in the canonical ensemble the number of physical systems that have been rigorously proven to be ergodic is small a famous example is the hard-sphere system of yakov sinai 48 the requirements for isolated systems to ensure ergodicity and thus equipartition have been studied and provided motivation for the modern chaos theory of dynamical systems a chaotic hamiltonian system need not be ergodic although that is usually a good assumption 49 a commonly cited counter-example where energy is not shared among its various forms and where equipartition does not hold in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators 49 if the system is isolated from the rest of the world the energy in each normal mode is constant energy is not transferred from one mode to another hence equipartition does not hold for such a system the amount of energy in each normal mode is fixed at its initial value if sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the energy function energy may be transferred between the normal modes leading to ergodicity and rendering the law of equipartition valid however the kolmogorov arnold moser theorem states that energy will not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough if they are too small the energy will remain trapped in at least some of the modes another way ergodicity can be broken is by the existence of nonlinear soliton symmetries in 1953 fermi pasta ulam and tsingou conducted computer simulations of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term quadratic in one test cubic in another and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third they found that the behavior of the system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared the system exhibited a very complicated quasi-periodic behavior this puzzling result was eventually explained by kruskal and zabusky in 1965 in a paper which by connecting the simulated system to the korteweg de vries equation led to the development of soliton mathematics failure due to quantum effects edit the law of equipartition breaks down when the thermal energy kbt is significantly smaller than the spacing between energy levels equipartition no longer holds because it is a poor approximation to assume that the energy levels form a smooth continuum which is required in the derivations of the equipartition theorem above 5 9 historically the failures of the classical equipartition theorem to explain specific heats and blackbody radiation were critical in showing the need for a new theory of matter and radiation namely quantum mechanics and quantum field theory 11 figure 10 log log plot of the average energy of a quantum mechanical oscillator shown in red as a function of temperature for comparison the value predicted by the equipartition theorem is shown in black at high temperatures the two agree nearly perfectly but at low temperatures when kbt h the quantum mechanical value decreases much more rapidly this resolves the problem of the ultraviolet catastrophe for a given temperature the energy in the high-frequency modes where h kbt is almost zero to illustrate the breakdown of equipartition consider the average energy in a single quantum harmonic oscillator which was discussed above for the classical case neglecting the irrelevant zero-point energy term its quantum energy levels are given by en nh where h is the planck constant is the fundamental frequency of the oscillator and n is an integer the probability of a given energy level being populated in the canonical ensemble is given by its boltzmann factor p e n e n h z displaystyle p e n frac e -n beta h nu z where 1 kbt and the denominator z is the partition function here a geometric series z n 0 e n h 1 1 e h displaystyle z sum n 0 infty e -n beta h nu frac 1 1-e - beta h nu its average energy is given by h n 0 e n p e n 1 z n 0 n h e n h 1 z z log z displaystyle langle h rangle sum n 0 infty e n p e n frac 1 z sum n 0 infty nh nu e -n beta h nu - frac 1 z frac partial z partial beta - frac partial log z partial beta substituting the formula for z gives the final result 9 h h e h 1 e h displaystyle langle h rangle h nu frac e - beta h nu 1-e - beta h nu at high temperatures when the thermal energy kbt is much greater than the spacing h between energy levels the exponential argument h is much less than one and the average energy becomes kbt in agreement with the equipartition theorem figure 10 however at low temperatures when h kbt the average energy goes to zero the higher-frequency energy levels are frozen out figure 10 as another example the internal excited electronic states of a hydrogen atom do not contribute to its specific heat as a gas at room temperature since the thermal energy kbt roughly 0.025 ev is much smaller than the spacing between the lowest and next higher electronic energy levels roughly 10 ev similar considerations apply whenever the energy level spacing is much larger than the thermal energy for example this reasoning was used by max planck and albert einstein to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe of blackbody radiation 50 the paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the electromagnetic field in a closed container each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator if each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy kbt there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container 50 51 however by the reasoning above the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as goes to infinity moreover planck s law of black body radiation which describes the experimental distribution of energy in the modes follows from the same reasoning 50 other more subtle quantum effects can lead to corrections to equipartition such as identical particles and continuous symmetries the effects of identical particles can be dominant at very high densities and low temperatures for example the valence electrons in a metal can have a mean kinetic energy of a few electronvolts which would normally correspond to a temperature of tens of thousands of kelvins such a state in which the density is high enough that the pauli exclusion principle invalidates the classical approach is called a degenerate fermion gas such gases are important for the structure of white dwarf and neutron stars at low temperatures a fermionic analogue of the bose einstein condensate in which a large number of identical particles occupy the lowest-energy state can form such superfluid electrons are responsible for superconductivity see also edit kinetic theory quantum
