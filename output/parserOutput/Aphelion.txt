perihelion and aphelion - wikipedia perihelion and aphelion from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from aphelion jump to navigation search it has been suggested that this article be merged into apsis discuss proposed since january 2018 the perihelion and aphelion are the nearest and farthest points apsides of a body s direct orbit around the sun the perihelion p r hi li n of any orbit of a celestial body about the sun is the point where the body comes nearest to the sun it is the opposite of aphelion p hi li n which is the point in the orbit where the celestial body is farthest from the sun 1 contents 1 etymology 2 astronomical meaning 3 application to earth 4 see also 5 references 6 external links etymology edit the words perihelion and aphelion were coined by johannes kepler 2 to describe the orbital motion of the planets the words are formed from the prefixes peri- greek near and apo- greek away from affixed to the greek word for the sun 3 perihelion and aphelion are sometimes incorrectly used for the orbits of objects about bodies other than the sun the correct terms are for orbits around the earth perigee and apogee for orbits around a star periastron and apastron for orbits around any center of mass periapsis or pericenter and apoapsis or apocenter astronomical meaning edit according to kepler s first law of planetary motion all planets comets and asteroids in the solar system have approximately elliptical orbits around the sun 4 it is only approximate because of perturbations due to the gravity of other bodies every ellipse has two focus points and the sun is at one of these focus points for the elliptical orbits of its satellites hence an orbiting body has a closest and a farthest point from its parent object that is a perihelion and an aphelion each extreme is known as an apsis orbital eccentricity measures the flatness departure from a perfect circle of the orbit earth alwalys moves around the sun application to earth edit earth is about 147.1 million kilometers 91.4 million miles from the sun at perihelion around january 3 in contrast to about 152.1 million kilometers 94.5 million miles at aphelion around july 4 a difference of about 5.0 million kilometers 3.1 million miles these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles for a table of these dates for various years see apsis because of the increased distance at aphelion only 93.55 of the solar radiation from the sun falls on a given area of land as does at perihelion however this fluctuation does not account for the seasons 5 as it is summer in the northern hemisphere when it is winter in the southern hemisphere and vice versa instead seasons result from the tilt of earth s axis which is 23.4 degrees away from perpendicular to the plane of earth s orbit around the sun winter falls on the hemisphere where sunlight strikes least directly and summer falls where sunlight strikes most directly regardless of the earth s distance from the sun in the northern hemisphere summer occurs at the same time as aphelion despite this there are larger land masses in the northern hemisphere which are easier to heat than the seas consequently summers are 2.3 c 4 f warmer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere under similar conditions 6 see also edit apsis
