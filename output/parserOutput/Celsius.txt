celsius - wikipedia celsius from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a thermometer calibrated in degrees celsius the celsius scale previously known as the centigrade scale 1 2 is a temperature scale used by the international system of units si as an si derived unit it is used by all countries in the world except the u s it is named after the swedish astronomer anders celsius 1701 1744 who developed a similar temperature scale the degree celsius symbol c can refer to a specific temperature on the celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty before being renamed to honor anders celsius in 1948 the unit was called centigrade from the latin centum which means 100 and gradus which means steps before 1954 the celsius scale was based on 0 c for the freezing point of water and 100 c for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure following a change introduced in 1743 by jean-pierre christin to reverse the celsius thermometer scale from water boiling at 0 degrees and ice melting at 100 degrees this scale is widely taught in schools today by international agreement since 1954 the unit degree celsius and the celsius scale are defined by absolute zero and the triple point of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow a specially purified water this definition also precisely relates the celsius scale to the kelvin scale which defines the si base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol k absolute zero the lowest temperature possible is defined as being exactly 0 k and 273.15 c the temperature of the triple point of water is defined as exactly 273.16 k 0.01 c 32.02 f 3 thus a temperature difference of one degree celsius and that of one kelvin is exactly the same with the null point of the kelvin scale 0 k at exactly 273.15 c and the null point of the celsius scale 0 c at exactly 273.15 k 4 contents 1 history 1.1 centigrade hectograde and celsius 1.2 common

swedish astronomer anders celsius 1701 1744 created a temperature scale which was the reverse of the scale now known by the name celsius 0 represented the boiling point of water while 100 represented the freezing point of water 5 in his paper observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer he recounted his experiments showing that the melting point of ice is essentially unaffected by pressure he also determined with remarkable precision how the boiling point of water varied as a function of atmospheric pressure he proposed that the zero point of his temperature scale being the boiling point would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level this pressure is known as one standard atmosphere the bipm s 10th general conference on weights and measures cgpm later defined one standard atmosphere to equal precisely 1013250dynes per square centimetre 101.325 kpa 6 in 1743 the lyonnais physicist jean-pierre christin permanent secretary of the acad mie des sciences belles-lettres et arts de lyonfr working independently of celsius developed a scale where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water 7 8 on 19 may 1743 he published the design of a mercury thermometer the thermometer of lyon built by the craftsman pierre casati that used this scale 9 10 11 in 1744 coincident with the death of anders celsius the swedish botanist carl linnaeus 1707 1778 reversed celsius s scale 12 his custom-made linnaeus-thermometer for use in his greenhouses was made by daniel ekstr m sweden s leading maker of scientific instruments at the time and whose workshop was located in the basement of the stockholm observatory as often happened in this age before modern communications numerous physicists scientists and instrument makers are credited with having independently developed this same scale 13 among them were pehr elvius the secretary of the royal swedish academy of sciences which had an instrument workshop and with whom linnaeus had been corresponding daniel ekstr m sv the instrument maker and m rten str mer 1707 1770 who had studied astronomy under anders celsius the first known swedish document 14 reporting temperatures in this modern forward celsius scale is the paper hortus upsaliensis dated 16 december 1745 that linnaeus wrote to a student of his samuel naucl r in it linnaeus recounted the temperatures inside the orangery at the university of uppsala botanical garden since the caldarium the hot part of the greenhouse by the angle of the windows merely from the rays of the sun obtains such heat that the thermometer often reaches 30 degrees although the keen gardener usually takes care not to let it rise to more than 20 to 25 degrees and in winter not under 15 degrees centigrade hectograde and celsius edit since the 19th century the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade scale temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or when greater specificity was desired as degrees centigrade symbol c because the term centigrade was also the spanish and french language name for a unit of angular measurement 1 10000 of a right angle and had a similar connotation in other languages the term centesimal degree known as the gradian grad or gon 1 0.9 100 90 was used when very precise unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the bipm more properly what was defined as centigrade then would now be hectograde furthermore in the context here centigrade hectograde is referring to the whole 0 100 range not the given part thereof hence 20 centigrade means 20 per 100 gradians or 20 hectograde not its literal description 0.2 gradians to be descriptively correct 20 centigrade should be 20 hectocentigrade or just 20 gradians 20 to eliminate such confusion the 9th cgpm and the cipm comit international des poids et mesures formally adopted degree celsius in 1948 15 a formally keeping the recognized degree symbol rather than adopting the gradian centesimal degree symbol for scientific use celsius is the term usually used with centigrade otherwise continuing to be in common but decreasing use especially in informal contexts in english-speaking countries 16 it was not until february 1985 that the forecasts issued by the bbc switched from centigrade to celsius 17 common temperatures edit some key temperatures relating the celsius scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below key scale relations kelvin celsius

edit the degree celsius has been the only si unit whose full unit name contains an uppercase letter since the si base unit for temperature the kelvin became the proper name in 1967 replacing the term degrees kelvin the plural form is degrees celsius 21 the general rule of the international bureau of weights and measures bipm is that the numerical value always precedes the unit and a space is always used to separate the unit from the number e g 30.2 c not 30.2 c or 30.2 c 22 thus the value of the quantity is the product of the number and the unit the space being regarded as a multiplication sign just as a space between units implies multiplication the only exceptions to this rule are for the unit symbols for degree minute and second for plane angle and respectively for which no space is left between the numerical value and the unit symbol 23 other languages and various publishing houses may follow different typographical rules unicode character edit unicode provides the celsius symbol at codepoint u 2103 degree celsius however this is a compatibility character provided for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings it easily allows correct rendering for vertically written east asian scripts such as chinese the unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character in normal use it is better to represent degrees celsius c with a sequence of u 00b0 degree sign u 0043 c latin capital letter c rather than u 2103 degree celsius for searching treat these two sequences as identical 24 shown below is the degree celsius character followed immediately by the two-component version c when viewed on computers that properly support unicode the above line may be similar to the image in the line below enlarged for clarity the canonical decomposition is simply an ordinary degree sign and c so some browsers may simply display c in its place due to unicode normalization temperatures and intervals edit the degree celsius is a special name for the kelvin for use in expressing celsius temperatures 25 the degree celsius is also subject to the same rules as the kelvin with regard to the use of its unit name and symbol thus besides expressing specific temperatures along its scale e g gallium melts at 29.7646 c and the temperature outside is 23 degrees celsius the degree celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature intervals differences between temperatures or their uncertainties e g the output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees celsius and our standard uncertainty is 3 c 26 because of this dual usage one must not rely upon the unit name or its symbol to denote that a quantity is a temperature interval it must be unambiguous through context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval c this is sometimes solved by using the symbol c pronounced degrees celsius for a temperature and c pronounced celsius degrees for a temperature interval although this usage is non-standard 27 what is often confusing about the celsius measurement is that it follows an interval system but not a ratio system that it follows a relative scale not an absolute scale this is put simply by illustrating that while 10 c and 20 c have the same interval difference as 20 c and 30 c the temperature 20 c is not twice the air heat energy as 10 c as this example shows degrees celsius is a useful interval measurement but does not possess the characteristics of ratio measures like weight or distance 28 coexistence of kelvin and celsius scales edit in science and in engineering the celsius scale and the kelvin scale are often used in combination in close contexts e g a measured value was 0.01023 c with an uncertainty of 70 k this practice is permissible because the magnitude of the degree celsius is equal to that of the kelvin but referring to a microdegree celsius would be awkward notwithstanding the official endorsement provided by decision which stated a temperature interval may also be expressed in degrees celsius the practice of simultaneously using both c and k remains widespread throughout the scientific world as the use of si-prefixed forms of the degree celsius such as c or microdegrees celsius to express a temperature interval has not been well-adopted melting and boiling points of water edit one effect of defining the celsius scale at the triple point of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 273.16 k and 0.01 c and at absolute zero 0 k and 273.15 c is that neither the melting nor boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere 101.325 kpa remains a defining point for the celsius scale in 1948 when the 9th general conference on weights and measures cgpm in resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point the triple point was so close to being 0.01 c greater than water s known melting point it was simply defined as precisely 0.01 c 29 however current measurements show that the difference between the triple and melting points of vsmow is actually very slightly 0.001 c greater than 0.01 c thus the actual melting point of ice is very slightly less than a thousandth of a degree below 0 c also defining water s triple point at 273.16 k precisely defined the magnitude of each 1 c increment in terms of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale referencing absolute zero now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water the value 100 c is hotter than 0 c in absolute terms by a factor of precisely 373.15 273.15 approximately 36.61 thermodynamically hotter when adhering strictly to the two-point definition for calibration the boiling point of vsmow under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339 k 99.9839 c when calibrated to its-90 a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation the boiling point of vsmow is slightly less about 99.974 c 30 this boiling-point difference of 16.1 millikelvin between the celsius scale s original definition and the current one based on absolute zero and the triple point has little practical meaning in common daily applications because water s boiling point is very sensitive to variations in barometric pressure for example an altitude change of only 28 cm 11 in causes the boiling point to change by one millikelvin celsius temperature conversion formulae from

comparisons among various temperature scales see also edit comparison of temperature scales degrees of frost its-90 r aumur scale thermodynamic temperature notes edit according to the oxford english dictionary oed the term celsius thermometer had been used at least as early as 1797 further the term the celsius or centigrade thermometer was again used in reference to a particular type of thermometer at least as early as 1850 the oed also cites this 1928 reporting of a temperature my altitude was about 5,800 metres the temperature was 28 celsius however dictionaries seek to find the earliest use of a word or term and are not a useful resource as regards to the terminology used throughout the history of science according to several writings of dr terry quinn cbe frs director of the bipm 1988 2004 including pdf 146 kib as well as temperature 2nd edition 1990 academic press 0125696817 the term celsius in connection with the centigrade scale was not used whatsoever by the scientific or thermometry communities until after the cipm and cgpm adopted the term in 1948 the bipm was not even aware that degree celsius was in sporadic non-scientific use before that time it is also noteworthy that the twelve-volume 1933 edition of oed didn t even have a listing for the word celsius but did have listings for both centigrade and centesimal in the context of temperature measurement the 1948 adoption of celsius accomplished three objectives 1 all common temperature scales would have their units named after someone closely associated with them namely kelvin celsius fahrenheit r aumur and rankine 2 notwithstanding the important contribution of linnaeus who gave the celsius scale its modern form celsius name was the obvious choice because it began with the letter c thus the symbol c that for centuries had been used in association with the name centigrade could continue to be used and would simultaneously inherit an intuitive association with the new name 3 the new name eliminated the ambiguity of the term centigrade freeing it to refer exclusively to the french-language name for the unit of angular measurement for vienna standard mean ocean water at one standard atmosphere 101.325 kpa when calibrated solely per the two-point definition of thermodynamic temperature older definitions of the celsius scale once defined the boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere as being precisely 100 c however the current definition results in a boiling point that is actually 16.1 mk less for more about the actual boiling point of water see vsmow in temperature measurement there is a different approximation using its-90 which approximates the temperature to 99.974 c in 1948 stated to indicate a temperature interval or difference rather than a temperature the word degree in full or the abbreviation deg must be used this resolution was abrogated in 1967 1968 by which stated that the names degree kelvin and degree the symbols k and deg and the rules for their use given in resolution 7 of the 9th cgpm 1948 and the designation of the unit to express an interval or a difference of temperatures are abrogated but the usages which derive from these decisions remain permissible for the time being consequently there is now wide freedom in usage regarding how to indicate a temperature interval the most important thing is that one s intention must be clear and the basic rule of the si must be followed namely that the unit name or its symbol must not be relied upon to indicate the nature of the quantity thus if a temperature interval is say 10 k or 10 c which may be written 10 kelvin or 10 degrees celsius it must be unambiguous through obvious context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval rules governing the expressing of temperatures and intervals are covered in the bipm s pdf 1.39 mib references edit encyclop dia britannica retrieved 19 february 2012 celsius temperature scale also called centigrade temperature
