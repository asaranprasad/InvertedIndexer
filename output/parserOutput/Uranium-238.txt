decay 4.267 mev uranium-238 238u or u-238 is the most common isotope of uranium found in nature with a relative abundance of 99 unlike uranium-235 it is non-fissile which means it cannot sustain a chain reaction however it is fissionable by fast neutrons and is fertile meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 238u cannot support a chain reaction because inelastic scattering reduces neutron energy below the range where fast fission of one or more next-generation nuclei is probable doppler broadening of u-238 s neutron absorption resonances increasing absorption as fuel temperature increases is also an essential negative feedback mechanism for reactor control around 99.284 of natural uranium s mass is uranium-238 which has a half-life of 1.41 1017 seconds 4.468 109 years or 4.468 billion years 1 due to its natural abundance and half-life relative to other radioactive elements 238 u displaystyle 238 u produces 40 of the radioactive heat produced within the earth 2 238 u displaystyle 238 u decay contributes 6 electron anti-neutrinos per decay 1 per beta decay resulting in a large detectable geoneutrino signal when decays occur within the earth 3 the decay of 238 u displaystyle 238 u to daughter isotopes is extensively used in radiometric dating particularly for material older than 1 million years depleted uranium has an even higher concentration of the 238u isotope and even low-enriched uranium leu while having a higher proportion of the uranium-235 isotope in comparison to depleted uranium is still mostly 238u reprocessed uranium is also mainly 238u with about as much uranium-235 as natural uranium a comparable proportion of uranium-236 and much smaller amounts of other isotopes of uranium such as uranium-234 uranium-233 and uranium-232 4

external links nuclear energy applications edit in a fission nuclear reactor uranium-238 can be used to generate 239pu which itself can be used in a nuclear weapon or as a nuclear-reactor fuel supply in a typical nuclear reactor up to one-third of the generated power does come from the fission of 239pu which is not supplied as a fuel to the reactor but rather produced from 238u breeder reactors edit 238u is not usable directly as nuclear fuel though it can produce energy via fast fission in this process a neutron that has a kinetic energy in excess of 1 mev can cause the nucleus of 238u to split in two depending on design this process can contribute some one to ten percent of all fission reactions in a reactor but too few of the about 2.5 neutrons 5 produced in each fission have enough speed to continue a chain reaction 238u can be used as a source material for creating plutonium-239 which can in turn be used as nuclear fuel breeder reactors carry out such a process of transmutation to convert the fertile isotope 238u into fissile pu-239 it has been estimated that there is anywhere from 10,000 to five billion years worth of 238u for use in these power plants 6 breeder technology has been used in several experimental nuclear reactors 7 by december 2005 the only breeder reactor producing power was the 600-megawatt bn-600 reactor at the beloyarsk nuclear power station in russia russia has planned to build another unit bn-800 at the beloyarsk nuclear power plant also japan s monju breeder reactor is planned to be started having been shut down since 1995 and both china and india have announced plans to build nuclear breeder reactors however after safety and design hazards were uncovered in 2016 the japanese government ordered the decommissioning of the monju reactor which may be completed by 2047 the breeder reactor as its name implies creates even larger quantities of pu-239 than the fission nuclear reactor the clean and environmentally safe advanced reactor caesar a nuclear reactor concept that would use steam as a moderator to control delayed neutrons will potentially be able to burn 238u as fuel once the reactor is started with leu fuel this design is still in the early stages of development radiation shielding edit 238u is also used as a radiation shield its alpha radiation is easily stopped by the non-radioactive casing of the shielding and the uranium s high atomic weight and high number of electrons are highly effective in absorbing gamma rays and x-rays it is not as effective as ordinary water for stopping fast neutrons both metallic depleted uranium and depleted uranium dioxide are used for radiation shielding uranium is about five times better as a gamma ray shield than lead so a shield with the same effectiveness can be packed into a thinner layer ducrete a concrete made with uranium dioxide aggregate instead of gravel is being investigated as a material for dry cask storage systems to store radioactive waste downblending edit the opposite of enriching is downblending surplus highly enriched uranium can be downblended with depleted uranium or natural uranium to turn it into low enriched uranium suitable for use in commercial nuclear fuel 238u from depleted uranium and natural uranium is also used with recycled pu-239 from nuclear weapons stockpiles for making mixed oxide fuel mox which is now being redirected to become fuel for nuclear reactors this dilution also called downblending means that any nation or group that acquired the finished fuel would have to repeat the very expensive and complex chemical separation of uranium and plutonium process before assembling a weapon nuclear weapons edit most modern nuclear weapons utilize 238u as a tamper material see nuclear weapon design a tamper which surrounds a fissile core works to reflect neutrons and to add inertia to the compression of the pu-239 charge as such it increases the efficiency of the weapon and reduces the critical mass required in the case of a thermonuclear weapon 238u can be used to encase the fusion fuel the high flux of very energetic neutrons from the resulting fusion reaction causes 238u nuclei to split and adds more energy to the yield of the weapon such weapons are referred to as fission-fusion-fission weapons after the order in which each reaction takes place an example of such a weapon is castle bravo the larger portion of the total explosive yield in this design comes from the final fission stage fueled by 238u producing enormous amounts of radioactive fission products for example an estimated 77 of the 10.4-megaton yield of the ivy mike thermonuclear test in 1952 came from fast fission of the depleted uranium tamper because depleted uranium has no critical mass it can be added to thermonuclear bombs in almost unlimited quantity the soviet union s test of the tsar bomba in 1961 produced only 50 megatons of explosive power over 90 of which came from fusion because the 238u final stage had been replaced with lead had 238u been used instead the yield of the tsar bomba could have been well-above 100 megatons and it would have produced nuclear fallout equivalent to one third of the global total that had been produced up to that time radium series or uranium series edit the decay chain of 238u is commonly called the radium series sometimes uranium series beginning with naturally occurring uranium-238 this series includes the following elements astatine bismuth lead polonium protactinium radium radon thallium and thorium all are present at least transiently in any

by 0.693 or multiplied by 1.443 i e ca 2 1017 seconds so 1 mole of 238u emits 3 106 alpha particles per second producing the same number of thorium-234 th-234 atoms in a closed system an equilibrium would be reached with all amounts except for lead-206 and 238u in fixed ratios in slowly decreasing amounts the amount of pb-206 will increase accordingly while that of 238u decreases all steps in the decay chain have this same rate of 3 106 decayed particles per second per mole 238u thorium-234 has a mean lifetime of 3 106 seconds so there is equilibrium if one mole of 238u contains 9 1012 atoms of thorium-234 which is 1.5 10 11 mole the ratio of the two half-lives similarly in an equilibrium in a closed system the amount of each decay product except the end product lead is proportional to its half-life as already touched upon above when starting with pure 238u within a human timescale the equilibrium applies for the first three steps in the decay chain only thus for one mole of 238u 3 106 times per second one alpha and two beta particles and gamma ray are produced together 6.7 mev a rate of 3 w extrapolated over 2 1017 seconds this is 600 gigajoules the total energy released in the first three steps in the decay chain radioactive dating edit 238 u displaystyle 238 u abundance and its decay to daughter isotopes comprises multiple uranium dating techniques and is one of the most common radioactive isotopes used in radiometric dating the most common dating method is uranium-lead dating which is used to date rocks older than 1 million years old and has provided ages for the oldest rocks on earth at 4.4 billion years old 8 the relation between 238u and 234u gives an indication of the age of sediments and seawater that are between 100,000 years and 1,200,000 years in age 9 the 238 u displaystyle 238 u daughter product 206 p b displaystyle 206 pb is an integral part of lead lead dating which is most famous for the determination of the age of the earth 10 the voyager spacecrafts carry small amounts of initially pure 238u on the covers of their golden records to facilitate dating in the same manner citation needed see also edit depleted uranium uranium-lead dating
