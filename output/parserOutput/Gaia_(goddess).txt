immortals who possess olympus above 10 and the depths of tartarus below as some scholars interpret it 11 he then tells that gaia brought forth her equal uranus heaven sky to cover her on every side and to be the abode of the gods 12 gaia also bore the hills ourea and pontus sea without sweet union of love i e with no father 13 afterwards with uranus she gave birth to the titans as hesiod tells it she lay with heaven and bore deep-swirling oceanus coeus and crius and hyperion and iapetus theia and rhea themis and mnemosyne and gold-crowned phoebe and lovely tethys after them was born cronos cronus the wily youngest and most terrible of her children and he hated his lusty sire 14 according to hesiod gaia conceived further offspring with uranus first the giant one-eyed cyclopes brontes thunder steropes lightning and arges bright 15 then the hecatonchires cottus briareos and gyges each with a hundred arms and fifty heads 16 as each of the cyclopes and hecatonchires were born uranus hid them in a secret place within gaia causing her great pain so gaia devised a plan she created a grey flint or adamantine sickle and cronus used the sickle to castrate his father uranus as he approached gaia to have sex with her from uranus spilled blood gaia produced the erinyes the giants and the meliae ash-tree nymphs from the testicles of uranus in the sea came forth aphrodite 17 by her son pontus gaia bore the sea-deities nereus thaumas phorcys ceto and eurybia 18 because cronus had learned from gaia and uranus that he was destined to be overthrown by one of his children he swallowed each of the children born to him by his titan sister rhea but when rhea was pregnant with her youngest child zeus she sought help from gaia and uranus when zeus was born rhea gave cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling-clothes in his place which cronus swallowed and gaia took the child into her care 19 with the help of gaia s advice 20 zeus defeated the titans but afterwards gaia in union with tartarus bore the youngest of her sons typhon who would be the last challenge to the authority of zeus 21 other sources edit according to hyginus earth gaia along with heaven and sea were the children of aether and day hemera 22 according to apollodorus gaia and tartarus were the parents of echidna 23 zeus hid elara one of his lovers from hera by stowing her under the earth his son by elara the giant tityos is therefore sometimes said to be a son of gaia the earth goddess gaia is believed by some sources 24 to be the original deity behind the oracle at delphi depending on the source gaia passed her powers on to poseidon apollo or themis apollo is the best-known as the oracle power behind delphi long established by the time of homer having killed gaia s child python there

great mother venerated in neolithic times her existence is a speculation and controversial in the academic community some modern mythographers including karl kerenyi carl a p ruck and danny staples interpret the goddesses demeter the mother persephone the daughter and hecate the crone as aspects of a former great goddess identified by some who as rhea or as gaia herself in crete a goddess was worshiped as potnia theron the mistress of the animals or simply potnia mistress speculated by whom as rhea or gaia the title was later applied in greek texts to demeter artemis or athena the mother-goddess cybele from anatolia modern turkey was partly identified by the greeks with gaia but more so with rhea and demeter neopaganism edit many neopagans worship gaia beliefs regarding gaia vary ranging from the belief that gaia is the earth to the belief that she is the spiritual embodiment of the earth or the goddess of the earth 28 modern ecological theory edit the mythological name was revived in 1979 by james lovelock in gaia a new look at life on earth his gaia hypothesis was supported by lynn margulis the hypothesis proposes that living organisms and inorganic material are part of a dynamical system that shapes the earth s biosphere and maintains the earth as a fit environment for life in some gaia theory approaches the earth itself is viewed as an organism with self-regulatory functions further books by lovelock and others popularized the gaia hypothesis which was embraced to some extent by new age environmentalists as part of the heightened awareness of
