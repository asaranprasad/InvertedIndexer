plasma 14 15 with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process 16 it is by far the most important source of energy for life on earth its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers i e 109 times that of earth and its mass is about 330,000 times that of earth accounting for about 99.86 of the total mass of the solar system 17 about three quarters of the sun s mass consists of hydrogen 73 the rest is mostly helium 25 with much smaller quantities of heavier elements including oxygen carbon neon and iron 18 the sun is a g-type main-sequence star g2v based on its spectral class as such it is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf it formed approximately 4.6 billion a 10 19 years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud most of this matter gathered in the center whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the solar system the central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core it is thought that almost all stars form by this process the sun is roughly middle-aged it has not changed dramatically for more than four billion a years and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years after hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium the core of the sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant it is calculated that the sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of mercury and venus and render earth uninhabitable the enormous effect of the sun on earth has been recognized since prehistoric times and the sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity the synodic rotation of earth and its orbit around the sun are the basis of solar calendars one of which is the predominant calendar in use today contents 1 name and etymology 1.1 religious

external links name and etymology the english proper name sun developed from old english sunne and may be related to south cognates to english sun appear in other germanic languages including old frisian sunne sonne old saxon sunna middle dutch sonne modern dutch zon old high german sunna modern german sonne old norse sunna and gothic sunn all germanic terms for the sun stem from proto-germanic sunn n 20 21 the english weekday name sunday stems from old english sunnand g sun s day from before 700 and is ultimately a result of a germanic interpretation of latin dies solis itself a translation of the greek h m ra h l ou 22 the latin name for the sun sol is not common in general english language use the adjectival form is the related word solar 23 24 the term sol is also used by planetary astronomers to refer to the duration of a solar day on another planet such as mars 25 a mean earth solar day is approximately 24 hours whereas a mean martian sol is 24 hours 39 minutes and 35.244 seconds 26 religious aspects solar deities play a major role in many world religions and mythologies 27 the ancient sumerians believed that the sun was utu 28 29 the god of justice and twin brother of inanna the queen of heaven 28 who was identified as the planet venus 29 later utu was identified with the east semitic god shamash 28 29 utu was regarded as a helper-deity who aided those in distress 28 and in iconography he is usually portrayed with a long beard and clutching a saw 28 which represented his role as the dispenser of justice 28 from at least the 4th dynasty of ancient egypt the sun was worshipped as the god ra portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk and surrounded by a serpent in the new empire period the sun became identified with the dung beetle whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the sun in the form of the sun disc aten the sun had a brief resurgence during the amarna period when it again became the preeminent if not only divinity for the pharaoh akhenaton 30 31 in proto-indo-european religion the sun was personified as the goddess seh2ul 32 33 21 derivatives of this goddess in indo-european languages include the old norse s l sanskrit surya gaulish sulis lithuanian saul and slavic solntse 21 in ancient greek religion the sun deity was the male god helios 32 but traces of an earlier female solar deity are preserved in helen of troy 32 in later times helios was syncretized with apollo 34 in the bible malachi 4 2 mentions the sun of righteousness sometimes translated as the sun of justice 35 which some christians have interpreted as a reference to the messiah christ 36 in ancient roman culture sunday was the day of the sun god it was adopted as the sabbath day by christians who did not have a jewish background the symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by christians and perhaps the most important one that did not come from jewish traditions in paganism the sun was a source of life giving warmth and illumination to mankind it was the center of a popular cult among romans who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed the celebration of the winter solstice which influenced christmas was part of the roman cult of the unconquered sun sol invictus christian churches were built with an orientation so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise in the east 37 tonatiuh the aztec god of the sun was usually depicted holding arrows and a shield 38 and was closely associated with the practice of human sacrifice 38 the sun goddess amaterasu is the most important deity in the shinto religion 39 40 and she is believed to be the direct ancestor of all japanese emperors 39 characteristics the sun is a g-type main-sequence star that comprises about 99.86 of the mass of the solar system the sun has an absolute magnitude of 4.83 estimated to be brighter than about 85 of the stars in the milky way most of which are red dwarfs 41 42 the sun is a population i or heavy-element-rich b star 43 the formation of the sun may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae 44 this is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the solar system such as gold and uranium relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called population ii heavy-element-poor stars the heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star 43 the sun is by far the brightest object in the earth s sky with an apparent magnitude of 26.74 45 46 this is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest star sirius which has an apparent magnitude of 1.46 the mean distance of the sun s center to earth s center is approximately 1 astronomical unit about 150,000,000 km 93,000,000 mi though the distance varies as earth moves from perihelion in january to aphelion in july 47 at this average distance light travels from the sun s horizon to earth s horizon in about 8 minutes and 19 seconds while light from the closest points of the sun and earth takes about two seconds less the energy of this sunlight supports almost all life c on earth by photosynthesis 48 and drives earth s climate and weather the sun does not have a definite boundary but its density decreases exponentially with increasing height above the photosphere 49 for the purpose of measurement however the sun s radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere the apparent visible surface of the sun 50 by this measure the sun is a near-perfect sphere with an oblateness estimated at about 9 millionths 51 which means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only 10 kilometres 6.2 mi 52 the tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the sun 53 the sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles this differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the coriolis force due to the sun s rotation in a frame of reference defined by the stars the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles viewed from earth as it orbits the sun the apparent rotational period of the sun at its equator is about 28 days 54 sunlight the solar constant is the amount of power that the sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight the solar constant is equal to approximately 7003136800000000000 1,368 w m2 watts per square meter at a distance of one astronomical unit au from the sun that is on or near earth 55 sunlight on the surface of earth is attenuated by earth s atmosphere so that less power arrives at the surface closer to 7003100000000000000 1,000 w m2 in clear conditions when the sun is near the zenith 56 sunlight at the top of earth s atmosphere is composed by total energy of about 50 infrared light 40 visible light and 10 ultraviolet light 57 the atmosphere in particular filters out over 70 of solar ultraviolet especially at the shorter wavelengths 58 solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes earth s dayside upper atmosphere creating the electrically conducting ionosphere 59 the sun s color is white with a cie color-space index near 0.3 0.3 when viewed from space or when the sun is high in the sky when measuring all the photons emitted the sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other 60 61 when the sun is low in the sky atmospheric scattering renders the sun yellow red orange or magenta despite its typical whiteness most people mentally picture the sun as yellow the reasons for this are the subject of debate 62 the sun is a g2v star with g2 indicating its surface temperature of approximately 5,778 k 5,505 c 9,941 f and v that it like most stars is a main-sequence star 63 64 the average luminance of the sun is about 1.88 giga candela per square metre but as viewed through earth s atmosphere this is lowered to about 1.44 gcd m2 d however the luminance is not constant across the disk of the sun limb darkening composition the sun is composed primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium they account for 74.9 and 23.8 of the mass of the sun in the photosphere respectively 65 all heavier elements called metals in astronomy account for less than 2 of the mass with oxygen roughly 1 of the sun s mass carbon 0.3 neon 0.2 and iron 0.2 being the most abundant 66 the sun inherited its chemical composition from the interstellar medium out of which it formed the hydrogen and helium in the sun were produced by big bang nucleosynthesis and the heavier elements were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to the interstellar medium before the formation of the sun 67 the chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial solar system 68 however since the sun formed some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere therefore in today s photosphere the helium fraction is reduced and the metallicity is only 84 of what it was in the protostellar phase before nuclear fusion in the core started the protostellar sun s composition is believed to have been 71.1 hydrogen 27.4 helium and 1.5 heavier elements 65 today nuclear fusion in the sun s core has modified the composition by converting hydrogen into helium so the innermost portion of the sun is now roughly 60 helium with the abundance of heavier elements unchanged because heat is transferred from the sun s core by radiation rather than by convection see radiative zone below none of the fusion products from the core have risen to the photosphere 69 the reactive core zone of hydrogen burning where hydrogen is converted into helium is starting to surround an inner core of helium ash this development will continue and will eventually cause the sun to leave the main sequence to become a red giant 70 the solar heavy-element abundances described above are typically measured both using spectroscopy of the sun s photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures these meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar sun and are thus not affected by settling of heavy elements the two methods generally agree well 18 singly ionized iron-group elements in the 1970s much research focused on the abundances of iron-group elements in the sun 71 72 although significant research was done until 1978 it was difficult to determine the abundances of some iron-group elements e g cobalt and manganese via spectrography because of their hyperfine structures 71 the first largely complete set of oscillator strengths of singly ionized iron-group elements were made available in the 1960s 73 and these were subsequently improved 74 in 1978 the abundances of singly ionized elements of the iron group were derived 71 isotopic composition various authors have considered the existence of a gradient in the isotopic compositions of solar and planetary noble gases 75 e g correlations between isotopic compositions of neon and xenon in the sun and on the planets 76 prior to 1983 it was thought that the whole sun has the same composition as the solar atmosphere 77 in 1983 it was claimed that it was fractionation in the sun itself that caused the isotopic-composition relationship between the planetary and solar-wind-implanted noble gases 77 structure and energy production core the structure of the sun the core of the sun extends from the center to about 20 25 of the solar radius 78 it has a density of up to 7005150000000000000 150 g cm3 79 80 about 150 times the density of water and a temperature of close to 15.7 million kelvins k 80 by contrast the sun s surface temperature is approximately 5,800 k recent analysis of soho mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the radiative zone above 78 through most of the sun s life energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through a series of steps called the p p proton proton chain this process converts hydrogen into helium 81 only 0.8 of the energy generated in the sun comes from the cno cycle though this proportion is expected to increase as the sun becomes older 82 the core is the only region in the sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion 99 of the power is generated within 24 of the sun s radius and by 30 of the radius fusion has stopped nearly entirely the remainder of the sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outwards through many successive layers finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space as sunlight or the kinetic energy of particles 63 83 the proton proton chain occurs around 7037919999999999999 9.2 1037 times each second in the core converting about 3.7 1038 protons into alpha particles helium nuclei every second out of a total of 8.9 1056 free protons in the sun or about 6.2 1011 kg s 63 fusing four free protons hydrogen nuclei into a single alpha particle helium nucleus releases around 0.7 of the fused mass as energy 84 so the sun releases energy at the mass energy conversion rate of 4.26 million metric tons per second which requires 600 metric megatons of hydrogen 85 for 384.6 yottawatts 7026384600000000000 3.846 1026 w 1 or 9.192 1010 megatons of tnt per second theoretical models of the sun s interior indicate a power density of approximately 276.5 w m3 86 a value that more nearly approximates that of reptile metabolism or a compost pile 87 than of a thermonuclear bomb e the fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against the weight of the outer layers reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate 88 89 radiative zone from the core out to about 0.7 solar radii thermal radiation is the primary means of energy transfer 90 the temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core 80 this temperature gradient is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection 80 ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions 90 the density drops a hundredfold from 20 g cm3 to 0.2 g cm3 from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii the top of the radiative zone 90 tachocline the radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer the tachocline this is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another 91 presently it is hypothesized see solar dynamo that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the sun s magnetic field 80 convective zone the sun s convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii 500,000 km to near the surface in this layer the solar plasma is not dense enough or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation instead the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the sun s energy outward towards its surface material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise as a result an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the sun s photosphere above once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface its density increases and it sinks to the base of the convection zone where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues at the photosphere the temperature has dropped to 5,700 k and the density to only 0.2 g m3 about 1 6,000 the density of air at sea level 80 the thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains small-scale dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the sun 80 the sun s thermal columns are b nard cells and take the shape of hexagonal prisms 92 photosphere the effective temperature or black body temperature of the sun 5,777 k is the temperature a black body of the same size must have to yield the same total emissive power the visible surface of the sun the photosphere is the layer below which the sun becomes opaque to visible light 93 above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space and almost all of its energy escapes the sun entirely the change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of h ions which absorb visible light easily 93 conversely the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce h ions 94 95 the photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick and is slightly less opaque than air on earth because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part an image of the sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk in a phenomenon known as limb darkening 93 the spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at about 6,000 k interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere the photosphere has a particle density of 1023 m 3 about 0.37 of the particle number per volume of earth s atmosphere at sea level the photosphere is not fully ionized the extent of ionization is about 3 leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form 96 during early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on earth in 1868 norman lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium after the greek sun god helios twenty-five years later helium was isolated on earth 97 atmosphere during a total solar eclipse the solar corona can be seen with the naked eye during the brief period of totality during a total solar eclipse when the disk of the sun is covered by that of the moon parts of the sun s surrounding atmosphere can be seen it is composed of four distinct parts the chromosphere the transition region the corona and the heliosphere the coolest layer of the sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about 7005500000000000000 500 km above the photosphere and has a temperature of about 7003410000000000000 4,100 k 93 this part of the sun is cool enough to allow the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water which can be detected via their absorption spectra 98 the chromosphere transition region and corona are much hotter than the surface of the sun 93 the reason is not well understood but evidence suggests that alfv n waves may have enough energy to heat the corona 99 above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 7006200000000000000 2,000 km thick dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines 93 it is called the chromosphere from the greek root chroma meaning color because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses 90 the temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude ranging up to around 7004200000000000000 20,000 k near the top 93 in the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized 100 taken by hinode s solar optical telescope on 12 january 2007 this image of the sun reveals the filamentary nature of the plasma connecting regions of different magnetic polarity above the chromosphere in a thin about 200 km transition region the temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000 k in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 k 101 the temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma 100 the transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude rather it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments and is in constant chaotic motion 90 the transition region is not easily visible from earth s surface but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum 102 the corona is the next layer of the sun the low corona near the surface of the sun has a particle density around 1015 m 3 to 1016 m 3 100 f the average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000 2,000,000 k however in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000 20,000,000 k 101 although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection 101 103 the corona is the extended atmosphere of the sun which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the sun s photosphere a flow of plasma outward from the sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind 103 the heliosphere the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the sun is filled with the solar wind plasma this outermost layer of the sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfv nic that is where the flow becomes faster than the speed of alfv n waves 104 at approximately 20 solar radii 0.1 au turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within because the information can only travel at the speed of alfv n waves the solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere 105 106 forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape 103 until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 au from the sun in december 2004 the voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause 107 in late 2012 voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium 108 photons and neutrinos high-energy gamma-ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone usually after traveling only a few millimeters re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy with this sequence of emissions and absorptions it takes a long time for radiation to reach the sun s surface estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000 years 109 in contrast it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos which account for about 2 of the total energy production of the sun to reach the surface because energy transport in the sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter the time scale of energy transport in the sun is longer on the order of 30,000,000 years this is the time it would take the sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed 110 neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core but unlike photons they rarely interact with matter so almost all are able to escape the sun immediately for many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the sun were lower than theories predicted by a factor of 3 this discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of the effects of neutrino oscillation the sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the theory but neutrino detectors were missing 2 3 of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected 111 magnetism and activity magnetic field visible light photograph of sunspot 13 december 2006 butterfly diagram showing paired sunspot pattern graph is of sunspot area in this false-color ultraviolet image the sun shows a c3-class solar flare white area on upper left a solar tsunami wave-like structure upper right and multiple filaments of plasma following a magnetic field rising from the stellar surface the heliospheric current sheet extends to the outer reaches of the solar system and results from the influence of the sun s rotating magnetic field on the plasma in the interplanetary medium 112 the sun has a magnetic field that varies across the surface of the sun its polar field is 1 2 gauss 0.0001 0.0002 t whereas the field is typically 3,000 gauss 0.3 t in features on the sun called sunspots and 10 100 gauss 0.001 0.01 t in solar prominences 1 the magnetic field also varies in time and location the quasi-periodic 11-year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes 16 113 114 sunspots are visible as dark patches on the sun s photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface as a result sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere and so they appear dark at a typical solar minimum few sunspots are visible and occasionally none can be seen at all those that do appear are at high solar latitudes as the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator a phenomenon known as sp rer s law the largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across 115 an 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year babcock leighton dynamo cycle which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields at solar-cycle maximum the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field generated through differential rotation within the tachocline is near its maximum strength at this point in the dynamo cycle buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere giving rise to pairs of sunspots roughly aligned east west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities the magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle a phenomenon known as the hale cycle 116 117 during the solar cycle s declining phase energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field and sunspots diminish in number and size at solar-cycle minimum the toroidal field is correspondingly at minimum strength sunspots are relatively rare and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength with the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle the process carries on continuously and in an idealized simplified scenario each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change then in the overall polarity of the sun s large-scale magnetic field 118 119 the solar magnetic field extends well beyond the sun itself the electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the sun s magnetic field into space forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field 103 in an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines as a result the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward forcing it into a roughly radial structure for a simple dipolar solar magnetic field with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind 103 at great distances the rotation of the sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an archimedean spiral structure called the parker spiral 103 the interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field the sun s dipole magnetic field of 50 400 t at the photosphere reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1 nt at the distance of earth however according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at earth s location is around 5 nt about a hundred times greater 120 the difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the sun variation in activity measurements from 2005 of solar cycle variation during the last 30 years the sun s magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary magnetic field outward into the solar system 121 the effects of solar activity on earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the solar system with solar-cycle modulation of sunspot number comes a corresponding modulation of space weather conditions including those surrounding earth where technological systems can be affected long-term change long-term secular change in sunspot number is thought by some scientists to be correlated with long-term change in solar irradiance 122 which in turn might influence earth s long-term climate 123 for example in the 17th century the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades few sunspots were observed during a period known as the maunder minimum this coincided in time with the era of the little ice age when europe experienced unusually cold temperatures 124 earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures 125 a recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years these could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the milankovitch cycles 126 127 life phases the sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life it has not changed dramatically for over four billion a years and will remain fairly stable for more than five billion more however after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped the sun will undergo severe changes both internally and externally formation the sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars 128 this age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology 10 the result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest solar system material at 4.567 billion years ago 129 130 studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes such as iron-60 that form only in exploding short-lived stars this indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the sun formed a shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity 131 as one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure much of the mass became concentrated in the center whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other solar system bodies gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk eventually triggering nuclear fusion thus the sun was born main sequence evolution of the sun s luminosity radius and effective temperature compared to the present sun after ribas 2010 132 the sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium each second more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the sun s core producing neutrinos and solar radiation at this rate the sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of earth into energy about 0.03 of the total mass of the sun the sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star 133 the sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused the core is therefore shrinking allowing the outer layers of the sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force according to the inverse-square law this stronger force increases the pressure on the core which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs this process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser it is estimated that the sun has become 30 brighter in the last 4.5 billion years 134 at present it is increasing in brightness by about 1 every 100 million years 135 after core hydrogen exhaustion the size of the current sun now in the main sequence compared to its estimated size during its red-giant phase in the future the sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova instead it will exit the main sequence in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a red giant 136 137 as a red giant the sun will grow so large that it will engulf mercury venus and probably earth 137 138 even before it becomes a red giant the luminosity of the sun will have nearly doubled and earth will receive as much sunlight as venus receives today once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years the sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years it will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous this then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass 137 evolution of a sun-like star the track of a one solar mass star on the hertzsprung russell diagram is shown from the main sequence to the post-asymptotic-giant-branch stage after the red-giant branch the sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left but much happens first the core full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash where it is estimated that 6 of the core itself 40 of the sun s mass will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process 139 the sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity with a temperature a little lower than today it will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch but a star of the sun s mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch instead it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core 137 when the helium is exhausted the sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted except that this time it all happens faster and the sun becomes larger and more luminous this is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase and the sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell after about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch the sun becomes increasingly unstable with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so the thermal pulses become larger each time with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 au 140 according to a 2008 model earth s orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces and eventually drag from the lower chromosphere so that it will be engulfed by the sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase 1 and 3.8 million years after mercury and venus have respectively suffered the same fate models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius 137 for the sun four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula by the end of that phase lasting approximately 500,000 years the sun will only have about half of its current mass the post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster the luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases with the ejected half of the sun s mass becoming ionised into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 k the final naked core a white dwarf will have a temperature of over 100,000 k and contain an estimated 54.05 of the sun s present day mass 137 the planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical black dwarf 141 142 motion and location illustration of the milky way showing the location of the sun the sun lies close to the inner rim of the milky way s orion arm in the local interstellar cloud or the gould belt at a distance of 7.5 8.5 kpc 25,000 28,000 light-years from the galactic center 143 144 145 146 147 148 the sun is contained within the local bubble a space of rarefied hot gas possibly produced by the supernova remnant geminga 149 or multiple supernovae in subgroup b1 of the pleiades moving group 150 the distance between the local arm and the next arm out the perseus arm is about 6,500 light-years 151 the sun and thus the solar system is found in what scientists call the galactic habitable zone the apex of the sun s way or the solar apex is the direction that the sun travels relative to other nearby stars this motion is towards a point in the constellation hercules near the star vega of the 50 nearest stellar systems within 17 light-years from earth the closest being the red dwarf proxima centauri at approximately 4.2 light-years the sun ranks fourth in mass 152 orbit in milky way the sun orbits the center of the milky way and it is presently moving in the direction of the constellation of cygnus a simple model of the motion of a star in the galaxy

that the point takes to go once around the galaxy other stars with the same value of x v 2 b displaystyle x v 2b have take the same amount of time to go around the galaxy as the sun and thus remain in the same general vicinity as the sun the sun s orbit around the milky way is perturbed due to the non-uniform mass distribution in milky way such as that in and between the galactic spiral arms it has been argued that the sun s passage through the higher density spiral arms often coincides with mass extinctions on earth perhaps due to increased impact events 156 it takes the solar system about 225 250 million years to complete one orbit through the milky way a galactic year 157 so it is thought to have completed 20 25 orbits during the lifetime of the sun the orbital speed of the solar system about the center of the milky way is approximately 251 km s 156 mi s 158 at this speed it takes around 1,190 years for the solar system to travel a distance of 1 light-year or 7 days to travel 1 au 159 the milky way is moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation cmb in the direction of the constellation hydra with a speed of 550 km s and the sun s resultant velocity with respect to the cmb is about 370 km s in the direction of crater or leo 160 theoretical problems map of the full sun by stereo and sdo spacecraft coronal heating problem the temperature of the photosphere is approximately 6,000 k whereas the temperature of the corona reaches 1,000,000 2,000,000 k 101 the high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere 103 it is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating 101 the first is wave heating in which sound gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone 101 these waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat 161 the other is magnetic heating in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events nanoflares 162 currently it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism all waves except alfv n waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona 163 in addition alfv n waves do not easily dissipate in the corona current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms 101 faint young sun problem theoretical models of the sun s development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago during the archean eon the sun was only about 75 as bright as it is today such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on earth s surface and thus life should not have been able to develop however the geological record demonstrates that earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history and that the young earth was somewhat warmer than it is today one theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane than are present today which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it 164 however examination of archaean sediments appears inconsistent with the hypothesis of high greenhouse concentrations instead the moderate temperature range may be explained by a lower surface albedo brought about by less continental area and the lack of biologically induced cloud condensation nuclei this would have led to increased absorption of solar energy thereby compensating for the lower solar output 165 history of observation the enormous effect of the sun on earth has been recognized since prehistoric times and the sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity early understanding the trundholm sun chariot pulled by a horse is a sculpture believed to be illustrating an important part of nordic bronze age mythology the sculpture is probably from around 1350 bc it is displayed at the national museum of denmark the sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history humanity s most fundamental understanding of the sun is as the luminous disk in the sky whose presence above the horizon creates day and whose absence causes night in many prehistoric and ancient cultures the sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural entity worship of the sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient egyptians the inca of south america and the aztecs of what is now mexico in religions such as hinduism the sun is still considered a god many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind for example stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice some of the most prominent megaliths are located in nabta playa egypt mnajdra malta and at stonehenge england newgrange a prehistoric human-built mount in ireland was designed to detect the winter solstice the pyramid of el castillo at chich n itz in mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes the egyptians portrayed the god ra as being carried across the sky in a solar barque accompanied by lesser gods and to the greeks he was helios carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses from the reign of elagabalus in the late roman empire the sun s birthday was a holiday celebrated as sol invictus literally unconquered sun soon after the winter solstice which may have been an antecedent to christmas regarding the fixed stars the sun appears from earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac and so greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets greek planetes wanderer the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the roman era 166 167 168 development of scientific understanding in the early first millennium bc babylonian astronomers observed that the sun s motion along the ecliptic is not uniform though they did not know why it is today known that this is due to the movement of earth in an elliptic orbit around the sun with earth moving faster when it is nearer to the sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion 169 one of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the sun was the greek philosopher anaxagoras he reasoned that it was not the chariot of helios but instead a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the peloponnesus and that the moon reflected the light of the sun 170 for teaching this heresy he was imprisoned by the authorities and sentenced to death though he was later released through the intervention of pericles eratosthenes estimated the distance between earth and the sun in the 3rd century bc as of stadia myriads 400 and 80000 the translation of which is ambiguous implying either 4,080,000 stadia 755,000 km or 804,000,000 stadia 148 to 153 million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 au the latter value is correct to within a few percent in the 1st century ad ptolemy estimated the distance as 1,210 times the radius of earth approximately 7.71 million kilometers 0.0515 au 171 the theory that the sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient greek aristarchus of samos in the 3rd century bc and later adopted by seleucus of seleucia see heliocentrism this view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by nicolaus copernicus observations of sunspots were recorded during the han dynasty 206 bc ad 220 by chinese astronomers who maintained records of these observations for centuries averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century 172 the invention of the telescope in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by thomas harriot galileo galilei and other astronomers galileo posited that sunspots were on the surface of the sun rather than small objects passing between earth and the sun 173 arabic astronomical contributions include albatenius discovery that the direction of the sun s apogee the place in the sun s orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest is changing 174 in modern heliocentric terms this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the earth s orbit ibn yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the sun s position for many years using a large astrolabe 175 sol the sun from a 1550 edition of guido bonatti s liber astronomiae from an observation of a transit of venus in 1032 the persian astronomer and polymath avicenna concluded that venus is closer to earth than the sun 176 in 1672 giovanni cassini and jean richer determined the distance to mars and were thereby able to calculate the distance to the sun in 1666 isaac newton observed the sun s light using a prism and showed that it is made up of light of many colors 177 in 1800 william herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum 178 the 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the sun joseph von fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum the strongest of which are still often referred to as fraunhofer lines in the early years of the modern scientific era the source of the sun s energy was a significant puzzle lord kelvin suggested that the sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat 179 kelvin and hermann von helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time 179 180 in 1890 joseph lockyer who discovered helium in the solar spectrum proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the sun 181 not until 1904 was a documented solution offered ernest rutherford suggested that the sun s output could be maintained by an internal source of heat and suggested radioactive decay as the source 182 however it would be albert einstein who would provide the essential clue to the source of the sun s energy output with his mass-energy equivalence relation e mc2 183 in 1920 sir arthur eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen protons into helium nuclei resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass 184 the preponderance of hydrogen in the sun was confirmed in 1925 by cecilia payne using the ionization theory developed by meghnad saha an indian physicist the theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists subrahmanyan chandrasekhar and hans bethe hans bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the sun 185 186 in 1957 margaret burbidge geoffrey burbidge william fowler and fred hoyle showed that most of the elements in the universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars some like the sun 187 solar space missions the sun giving out a large geomagnetic storm on 1 29 pm est 13 march 2012 play media a lunar transit of the sun captured during calibration of stereo b s ultraviolet imaging cameras 188 the first satellites designed to observe the sun were nasa s pioneers 5 6 7 8 and 9 which were launched between 1959 and 1968 these probes orbited the sun at a distance similar to that of earth and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time transmitting data until may 1983 189 190 in the 1970s two helios spacecraft and the skylab apollo telescope mount provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona the helios 1 and 2 probes were u s german collaborations that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside mercury s orbit at perihelion 191 the skylab space station launched by nasa in 1973 included a solar observatory module called the apollo telescope mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station 102 skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona 102 discoveries included the first observations of coronal mass ejections then called coronal transients and of coronal holes now known to be intimately associated with the solar wind 191 coronal hole on the sun forms a question mark 22 december 2017 in 1980 the solar maximum mission was launched by nasa this spacecraft was designed to observe gamma rays x-rays and uv radiation from solar flares during a time of high solar activity and solar luminosity just a few months after launch however an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode and it spent the next three years in this inactive state in 1984 space shuttle challenger mission sts-41c retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit the solar maximum mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering earth s atmosphere in june 1989 192 launched in 1991 japan s yohkoh sunbeam satellite observed solar flares at x-ray wavelengths mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the sun it was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005 193 one of the most important solar missions to date has been the solar and heliospheric observatory jointly built by the european space agency and nasa and launched on 2 december 1995 102 originally intended to serve a two-year mission a mission extension through 2012 was approved in october 2009 194 it has proven so useful that a follow-on mission the solar dynamics observatory sdo was launched in february 2010 195 situated at the lagrangian point between earth and the sun at which the gravitational pull from both is equal soho has provided a constant view of the sun at many wavelengths since its launch 102 besides its direct solar observation soho has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the sun 196 a solar prominence erupts in august 2012 as captured by sdo all these satellites have observed the sun from the plane of the ecliptic and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail the ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the sun s polar regions it first travelled to jupiter to slingshot into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic once ulysses was in its scheduled orbit it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km s which was slower than expected and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays 197 elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic studies but the composition of the interior of the sun is more poorly understood a solar wind sample return mission genesis was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material 198 the solar terrestrial relations observatory stereo mission was launched in october 2006 two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause them to respectively pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind earth this enables stereoscopic imaging of the sun and solar phenomena such as coronal mass ejections 199 200 the indian space research organisation has scheduled the launch of a 100 kg satellite named aditya for 2017 18 its main instrument will be a coronagraph for studying the dynamics of the solar corona 201 observation and effects during certain atmospheric conditions the sun becomes clearly visible to the naked eye and can be observed without stress to the eyes click on this photo to see the full cycle of a sunset as observed from the high plains of the mojave desert the sun as seen from low earth orbit overlooking the international space station this sunlight is not filtered by the lower atmosphere which blocks much of the solar spectrum the brightness of the sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye however doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes 202 203 looking directly at the sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness it also delivers about 4 milliwatts of sunlight to the retina slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness 204 205 uv exposure gradually yellows the lens of the eye over a period of years and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts but this depends on general exposure to solar uv and not whether one looks directly at the sun 206 long-duration viewing of the direct sun with the naked eye can begin to cause uv-induced sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds particularly under conditions where the uv light from the sun is intense and well focused 207 208 conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants which admit more uv than aging natural eyes sun angles near the zenith and observing locations at high altitude viewing the sun through light-concentrating optics such as binoculars may result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks uv and substantially dims the sunlight when using an attenuating filter to view the sun the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use some improvised filters that pass uv or ir rays can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels 209 herschel wedges also called solar diagonals are effective and inexpensive for small telescopes the sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected the rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument if the glass breaks because of the heat no light at all is reflected making the device fail-safe simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break endangering the observer s eyesight unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye possibly causing immediate damage it is claimed that even brief glances at the midday sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage 210 halo with sun dogs partial solar eclipses are hazardous to view because the eye s pupil is not adapted to the unusually high visual contrast the pupil dilates according to the total amount of light in the field of view not by the brightest object in the field during partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the moon passing in front of the sun but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day in the overall gloom the pupil expands from 2 mm to 6 mm and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed sun this can damage or kill those cells resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer 211 the hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children because there is no perception of pain it is not immediately obvious that one s vision is being destroyed a sunrise during sunrise and sunset sunlight is attenuated because of rayleigh scattering and mie scattering from a particularly long passage through earth s atmosphere 212 and the sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds hazy conditions atmospheric dust and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation 213 an optical phenomenon known as a green flash can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise the flash is caused by light from the sun just below the horizon being bent usually through a temperature inversion towards the observer light of shorter wavelengths violet blue green is bent more than that of longer wavelengths yellow orange red but the violet and blue light is scattered more leaving light that is perceived as green 214 ultraviolet light from the sun has antiseptic properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water it also causes sunburn and has other biological effects such as the production of vitamin d and sun tanning ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by earth s ozone layer so that the amount of uv varies greatly with latitude and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations including variations in human skin color in different regions of the globe 215 planetary system the sun has eight known planets this includes four terrestrial planets mercury venus earth and mars two gas giants jupiter and saturn and two ice giants uranus and neptune the solar system also has at least five dwarf planets an asteroid belt numerous comets and a large number of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of neptune see also book the sun advanced composition explorer antisolar point list of brightest stars solar energy sun dogs sun path sun-earth day sunday sungazing timeline

hydrogen and helium hydrothermal vent communities live so deep under the sea that they have no access to sunlight bacteria instead use sulfur compounds as an energy source via chemosynthesis 1.88 gcd
