russian tr sibir ipa s b ir is an extensive geographical region and by the broadest definition is also known as north asia siberia has historically been a part of russia since the 16th and 17th centuries the territory of siberia extends eastwards from the ural mountains to the watershed between the pacific and arctic drainage basins the yenisei river conditionally divides siberia into five parts western and eastern siberia stretches southwards from the arctic ocean to the hills of north-central kazakhstan and to the national borders of mongolia and china 1 with an area of 13.1 million square kilometres 5,100,000 sq mi siberia accounts for 77 of russia s land area but it is home to just 40 million people 27 of the country s population this is equivalent to an average population density of about 3 inhabitants per square kilometre 7.8 sq mi approximately equal to that of australia making siberia one of the most sparsely populated regions on earth if it were a country by itself it would still be the largest country in area but in population it would be the world s 35th-largest and asia s 14th-largest worldwide siberia is well known primarily for its long harsh winters with a

external links etymology edit the origin of the name is unknown some sources say that siberia originates from the siberian tatar word for sleeping land sib ir 2 another account sees the name as the ancient tribal ethnonym of the sirtya ru also syopyr s p r a folk which spoke a language that later evolved into the ugric languages this ethnic group was later assimilated to the siberian tatar people the modern usage of the name was recorded in the russian language after the empire s conquest of the siberian khanate a further variant claims that the region was named after the xibe people 3 the polish historian chycliczkowski has proposed that the name derives from the proto-slavic word for north sever 4 but anatole baikaloff has dismissed this explanation 5 he said that the neighbouring chinese turks and mongolians who have similar names for the region would not have known russian he suggests that the name is a combination of two words su water and bir wild land prehistory edit the region is of paleontological significance as it contains bodies of prehistoric animals from the pleistocene epoch preserved in ice or permafrost specimens of goldfuss cave lion cubs yuka mammoth and another woolly mammoth from oymyakon a woolly rhinoceros from the kolyma river and bison and horses from yukagir have been found here 6 the siberian traps were formed by one of the largest-known volcanic events of the last 500 million years of earth s geological history they continued for a million years and are considered a possible cause of the great dying about 250 million years ago 7 which is estimated to have killed 90 of species existing at the time 8 at least three species of human lived in southern siberia around 40,000 years ago h sapiens h neanderthalensis and the denisovans 9 the last was determined in 2010 by dna evidence to be a new species history edit chukchi one of many indigenous peoples of siberia siberia was inhabited by different groups of nomads such as the enets the nenets the huns the scythians and the uyghurs the khan of sibir in the vicinity of modern tobolsk was known as a prominent figure who endorsed kubrat as khagan of old great bulgaria in 630 the mongols conquered a large part of this area early in the 13th century citation needed the map of the siberian route in the 18th century green and the early 19th century red with the breakup of the golden horde the autonomous khanate of sibir was established in the late 15th century turkic-speaking yakut migrated north from the lake baikal region under pressure from the mongol tribes during the 13th to 15th century 10 siberia remained a sparsely populated area historian john f richards wrote it is doubtful that the total early modern siberian population exceeded 300,000 persons 11 the growing power of russia in the west began to undermine the siberian khanate in the 16th century first groups of traders and cossacks began to enter the area the russian army was directed to establish forts farther and farther east to protect new settlers from european russia towns such as mangazeya tara yeniseysk and tobolsk were developed the last being declared the capital of siberia at this time sibir was the name of a fortress at qashlik near tobolsk gerardus mercator in a map published in 1595 marks sibier both as the name of a settlement and of the surrounding territory along a left tributary of the ob 12 other sources which contend that the xibe an indigenous tungusic people offered fierce resistance to russian expansion beyond the urals some suggest that the term siberia is a russification of their ethnonym by the mid-17th century russia had established areas of control that extended to the pacific some 230,000 russians had settled in siberia by 1709 13 siberia was a destination for sending exiles 14 the first great modern change in siberia was the trans-siberian railway constructed during 1891 1916 it linked siberia more closely to the rapidly industrialising russia of nicholas ii around seven million people moved to siberia from european russia between 1801 and 1914 15 from 1859 to 1917 more than half a million people migrated to the russian far east 16 siberia has extensive natural resources during the 20th century large-scale exploitation of these was developed and industrial towns cropped up throughout the region 17 siberian cossack family in novosibirsk at 7 15 a m on 30 june 1908 millions of trees were felled near the podkamennaya tunguska stony tunguska river in central siberia in the tunguska event most scientists believe this resulted from the air burst of a meteor or a comet even though no crater has ever been found the landscape in the uninhabited area still bears the scars of this event in the early decades of the soviet union especially the 1930s and 1940s the government established the gulag state agency to administer a system of penal labour camps replacing the previous katorga system 18 according to semi-official soviet estimates which were not made public until after the fall of the soviet government from 1929 to 1953 more than 14 million people passed through these camps and prisons many of which were in siberia another 7 to 8 million people were internally deported to remote areas of the soviet union including entire nationalities or ethnicities in several cases 19 half a million 516,841 prisoners died in camps from 1941 to 1943 20 due to food shortages caused by world war ii at other periods mortality was comparatively lower 21 the size scope and scale of the gulag slave labour camps remains a subject of much research and debate many gulag camps were positioned in extremely remote areas of northeastern siberia the best known clusters are sevvostlag the north-east camps along the kolyma river and norillag near norilsk where 69,000 prisoners were kept in 1952 22 major industrial cities of northern siberia such as norilsk and magadan developed from camps built by prisoners and run by ex-prisoners 23 geography edit gulf of ob novaya zemlya kara sea yenisei ob taymyr peninsula severnaya zemlya arctic ocean central siberian plateau siberian federal district lena sakha republic laptev

entirely within asia many authorities such as the un geoscheme will not subdivide countries and will place all of russia as part of europe and or eastern europe major geographical zones include the west siberian plain and the central siberian plateau eastern and central sakha comprises numerous north-south mountain ranges of various ages these mountains extend up to almost 3,000 metres 9,800 ft but above a few hundred metres they are almost completely devoid of vegetation the verkhoyansk range was extensively glaciated in the pleistocene but the climate was too dry for glaciation to extend to low elevations at these low elevations are numerous valleys many of them deep and covered with larch forest except in the extreme north where the tundra dominates soils are mainly turbels a type of gelisol the active layer tends to be less than one metre deep except near rivers the highest point in siberia is the active volcano klyuchevskaya sopka on the kamchatka peninsula its peak is at 4,750

the west siberian plain consists mostly of cenozoic alluvial deposits and is somewhat flat many deposits on this plain result from ice dams which produced a large glacial lake this mid- to late-pleistocene lake blocked the northward flow of the ob and yenisei rivers resulting in a redirection southwest into the caspian and aral seas via the turgai valley 25 the area is very swampy and soils are mostly peaty histosols and in the treeless northern part histels in the south of the plain where permafrost is largely absent rich grasslands that are an extension of the kazakh steppe formed the original vegetation most of which is not visible anymore why the central siberian plateau is an ancient craton sometimes named angaraland that formed an independent continent before the permian see the siberian continent it is exceptionally rich in minerals containing large deposits of gold diamonds and ores of manganese lead zinc nickel cobalt and molybdenum much of the area includes the siberian traps a large igneous province this massive eruptive period was approximately coincident with the permian triassic extinction event the volcanic event is said to be the largest known volcanic eruption in earth s history only the extreme northwest was glaciated during the quaternary but almost all is under exceptionally deep permafrost and the only tree that can thrive despite the warm summers is the deciduous siberian larch larix sibirica with its very shallow roots outside the extreme northwest the taiga is dominant covering a significant fraction of the entirety of siberia 26 soils here are mainly turbels giving way to spodosols where the active layer becomes thicker and the ice content lower belukha mountain autumn forest in the eastern sayan mountains buryatia the lena-tunguska petroleum province includes the central siberian platform some authors refer to it as the eastern siberian platform bounded on the northeast and east by the late carboniferous through jurassic verkhoyansk foldbelt on the northwest by the paleozoic taymr foldbelt and on the southeast south and southwest by the middle silurian to middle devonian baykalian foldbelt 27 228 a regional geologic reconnaissance study begun in 1932 followed by surface and subsurface mapping revealed the markova-angara arch anticline this led to the discovery of the markovo oil field in 1962 with the markovo 1 well which produced from the early cambrian osa horizon bar-sandstone at a depth of 2,156 metres 7,073 ft 27 243 the sredne-botuobin gas field was discovered in 1970 producing from the osa and the proterozoic parfenovo horizon 27 244 the yaraktin oil field was discovered in 1971 producing from the vendian yaraktin horizon at depths of up to 1,750 metres 5,740

in siberia is mostly taiga with a tundra belt on the northern fringe and a temperate forest zone in the south the climate of siberia varies dramatically but all of it basically has short summers and long and extremely cold winters on the north coast north of the arctic circle there is a very short about one-month-long summer taiga near lake baikal almost all the population lives in the south along the trans-siberian railway the climate in this southernmost part is humid continental climate k ppen dfb with cold winters but fairly warm summers lasting at least four months the annual average is about 0.5 c 32.9 f january averages about 20 c 4 f and july about 19 c 66 f while daytime temperatures in summer typically are above 20 c 68 f 28 29 with a reliable growing season an abundance of sunshine and exceedingly fertile chernozem soils southern siberia is good enough for profitable agriculture as was proven in the early 20th century by far the most commonly occurring climate in siberia is continental subarctic koppen dfc or dwc with the annual average temperature about 5 c 23 f and an average for january of 25 c 13 f and an average for july of 17 c 63 f 30 although this

as being in competition for the title of the northern hemisphere s pole of cold oymyakon is a village which recorded a temperature of 67.7 c 89.9 f on 6 february 1933 verkhoyansk a town further north and further inland recorded a temperature of 69.8 c 93.6 f for 3 consecutive nights 5 6 and 7 february 1933 each town is alternately considered the northern hemisphere s pole of cold meaning the coldest inhabited point in the northern hemisphere each town also frequently reaches 86 f 30 c in the summer giving them and much of the rest of russian siberia the world s greatest temperature variation between summer s highs and winter s lows often being well over 170 180 f 94 100 c between the seasons 31 not in citation given southwesterly winds bring warm air from central asia and the

summer temperatures in other regions can reach 38 c 100 f in general sakha is the coldest siberian region and the basin of the yana river has the lowest temperatures of all with permafrost reaching 1,493 metres 4,898 ft nevertheless as far as imperial russian plans of settlement were concerned cold was never viewed as an impediment in the winter southern siberia sits near the center of the semi-permanent siberian high so winds are usually light in the winter precipitation in siberia is generally low exceeding 500 millimetres 20 in only in kamchatka where moist winds flow from the sea of okhotsk onto high mountains producing the region s only major glaciers though volcanic eruptions and low summer temperatures allow limited forests to grow precipitation is high also in most of

during ages historically siberia was defined as the whole part of russia to the east of ural mountains including the russian far east according to this definition siberia extended eastward from the ural mountains to the pacific coast and southward from the arctic ocean to the border of russian central asia and the national borders of both mongolia and china 44 soviet-era sources great soviet encyclopedia and others 45 and modern russian ones 46 usually define siberia as a region extending eastward from the ural mountains to the watershed between pacific and arctic drainage basins and southward from the arctic ocean to the hills of north-central kazakhstan and the national borders of both mongolia and china by this definition siberia includes the federal subjects of the siberian federal district and some of the ural federal district as well as sakha yakutia republic which is a part of the far eastern federal district geographically this definition includes subdivisions of several other subjects of urals and far eastern federal districts but they are not included administratively this definition excludes sverdlovsk oblast and chelyabinsk oblast both of which are included in some wider definitions of siberia other sources may use either a somewhat wider definition that states the pacific coast not the watershed is the eastern boundary thus including the whole russian far east 47 or a somewhat narrower one that limits siberia to the siberian federal district thus excluding all subjects of other districts 48 in russian the word for siberia is used as a substitute for the name of the federal district by those who live in the district itself and less commonly used to denote the federal district by people residing outside of it ulan-ude novosibirsk is

in minerals containing ores of almost all economically valuable metals it has some of the world s largest deposits of nickel gold lead coal molybdenum gypsum diamonds diopside silver and zinc as well as extensive unexploited resources of oil and natural gas 50 around 70 of russia s developed oil fields are in the khanty-mansiysk region 51 russia contains about 40 of the world s known resources of nickel at the norilsk deposit in siberia norilsk nickel is the world s biggest nickel and palladium producer 52 siberian agriculture is severely restricted by the short growing season of most of the region however in the southwest where soils are exceedingly fertile black earths and the climate is a little more moderate there is extensive cropping of wheat barley rye and potatoes along with the grazing of large numbers of sheep and cattle elsewhere food production owing to the poor fertility of the podzolic soils and the extremely short growing seasons is restricted to the herding of reindeer in the tundra which has been practiced by natives for over 10,000 years citation needed siberia has the world s largest forests timber remains an important source of revenue even though many forests in the east have been logged much more rapidly than they are able to recover the sea of okhotsk is one of the two or three richest fisheries in the world owing to its cold currents and very large tidal ranges and thus siberia produces over 10 of the world s annual fish catch although fishing has declined somewhat since the collapse of the ussr 53 sport edit bandy at sibselmash stadium in

districts located entirely east of the ural mountains together have a population of about 25.6 million tyumen and kurgan oblasts which are geographically in siberia but administratively part of the urals federal district together have a population of about 4.3 million thus the whole region of asian russia or siberia in the broadest usage of the term is home to approximately 30 million people 59 it has a population density of about three people per square kilometre all siberians are russian citizens and of these russian citizens of siberia most are slavic-origin russians and russified ukrainians 60 the remaining russian citizens of siberia consists of other groups of non-indigenous ethnic origins and those of indigenous siberian origin among the largest non-slavic group of russian citizens of siberia are the approximately 400,000 ethnic volga germans 61 the original indigenous groups of siberia including mongol and turkic groups such as buryats tuvinians yakuts and siberian tatars still mostly reside in siberia though they are minorities outnumbered by all other non-indigenous siberians indeed slavic-origin russians by themselves outnumber all of the indigenous peoples combined both in siberia as a whole and its cities except in the republic of tuva slavic-origin russians make up the majority in the buryat sakha and altai republics outnumbering the indigenous buryats sakha and altai the buryat make up only 25 of their own republic and the sakha and altai each are only one-third and the chukchi evenk khanti mansi and nenets are outnumbered by non-indigenous peoples by 90 of the population 62 according to the 2002 census there are 500,000 tatars in siberia but of these 300,000 are volga tatars who also settled in siberia during periods of colonization and are thus also non-indigenous siberians in contrast to the 200,000 siberian tatars which are indigenous to siberia 63 of the indigenous siberians the buryats numbering approximately 500,000 are the most numerous group in siberia and they are mainly concentrated in their homeland the buryat republic 64 according to the 2002 census there were 443,852 indigenous yakuts 65 other ethnic groups indigenous to siberia include kets evenks chukchis koryaks yupiks and yukaghirs about seventy percent of siberia s people live in cities mainly in apartments many people also live in rural areas in
