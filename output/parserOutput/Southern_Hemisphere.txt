through the north although north of the tropic of capricorn the mean sun can be directly overhead or due south at midday the sun rotating through the north causes an apparent right-left trajectory through the sky unlike the left-right motion of the sun when seen from the northern hemisphere as it passes through the southern sky sun-cast shadows turn anticlockwise throughout the day and sundials have the hours increasing in the anticlockwise direction during solar eclipses viewed from a point to the south of the tropic of capricorn the moon moves from left to right on the disc of the sun see
