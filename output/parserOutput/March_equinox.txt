https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox march equinox from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search illumination of earth by the sun on the day of an equinox the march equinox 1 2 or northward equinox 3 4 is the equinox on the earth when the subsolar point appears to leave the southern hemisphere and cross the celestial equator heading northward as seen from earth in the northern hemisphere the march equinox is known as the vernal equinox and in the southern hemisphere as the autumnal equinox 2 1 5 on the gregorian calendar the northward equinox can occur as early as 19 march or as late as 21 march for a common year the computed time slippage is about 5 hours 49 minutes later than the previous year and for a leap year about 18 hours 11 minutes earlier than the previous year balancing the increases of the common years against the losses of the leap years keeps the calendar date of the march equinox from drifting more than one day from 20 march each year the march equinox may be taken to mark the beginning of spring and the end of winter in the northern hemisphere but marks the beginning of autumn and the end of summer in the southern hemisphere 6 in astronomy the march equinox is the zero point of sidereal time and consequently right ascension 7 it also serves as a reference for calendars and celebrations in many human cultures and religions

northwards is called the first point of aries however due to the precession of the equinoxes this point is no longer in the constellation aries but rather in pisces by the year 2600 it will be in aquarius the earth s axis causes the first point of aries to travel westwards across the sky at a rate of roughly one degree every 72 years based on the modern constellation boundaries the northward equinox passed from taurus into aries in the year 1865 1866 bc passed into pisces in the year 67 68 bc will pass into aquarius in the year 2597 and will pass into capricornus in the year 4312 it passed by but not into a corner of cetus at 0 10 distance in the year 1489 apparent movement of the sun edit in its apparent motion on the day of an equinox the sun s disk crosses the earth s horizon directly to the east at dawn rising and again some 12 hours later directly to the west at dusk setting the march equinox like all equinoxes is characterized by having an almost exactly equal amount of daylight and night across most latitudes on earth due to refraction of light rays in the earth s atmosphere the sun will be visible above the horizon even when its disc is completely below the limb of the earth additionally when seen from the earth the sun is a bright disc in the sky and not just a point of light thus sunrise and sunset can be said to start several minutes before the sun s geometric center even crosses the horizon and extends equally long after these conditions produce differentials of actual durations of light and darkness at various locations on earth during an equinox this is most notable at the more extreme latitudes where the sun may be seen to travel sideways considerably during the dawn and evening drawing out the transition from day to night at the north and south poles the sun appears to move steadily around the horizon and just above the horizon neither rising nor setting apart from a slight change in declination of about 0.39 per day as the equinox passes 8 culture edit ut date and time of equinoxes and solstices on earth 9 event equinox solstice equinox solstice month march june september december year day time day time day time day

tropical year is about 11 minutes and 15 seconds less than that this had the effect of adding about three quarters of an hour every four years the effect accumulated from inception in 45 bc until the
