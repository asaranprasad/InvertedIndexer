etymology the japanese word for japan is which is pronounced nihon or nippon and literally means the origin of the sun the character nichi means sun or day hon means base or origin 23 the compound therefore means origin of the sun and is the source of the popular western epithet land of the rising sun 24 the earliest record of the name nihon appears in the chinese historical records of the tang dynasty the old book of tang at the end of the seventh century a delegation from japan requested that nihon be used as the name of their country this name may have its origin in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the official history of the sui dynasty prince sh toku the regent of japan sent a mission to china with a letter in which he called himself the emperor of the land where the sun rises the message said here i the emperor of the country where the sun rises send a letter to the emperor of the country where the sun sets how are you the king of na gold seal said to have been granted to na king of wa japan by emperor guangwu of han in 57 ce the seal reads tokyo national museum prior to the adoption of nihon other terms such as yamato or great wa and wakoku were used the term wa is a homophone of wo pronounced wa by the japanese which has been used by the chinese as a designation for the japanese as early as the third century three kingdoms period another form wei was used for an early state in japan called nakoku during the han dynasty 25 however the japanese disliked some connotation of wa which has been associated in china with concepts like dwarf or pygmy and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character wa meaning togetherness harmony 26 27 the english word japan possibly derives from the historical chinese pronunciation of the old mandarin or possibly early wu chinese pronunciation of japan was recorded by marco polo as cipangu in modern shanghainese a wu dialect the pronunciation of characters japan is zeppen z p n the old malay word for japan japun or japang was borrowed from a southern coastal chinese dialect probably fukienese or ningpo 28 and this malay word was encountered by portuguese traders in south east asia in the 16th century 29 these early portuguese traders then brought the word to europe 30 the first record of this name in english is in a book published in 1577 and spelled giapan in a translation of a 1565 letter written by a portuguese jesuit lu s fr is 31 32 from the meiji restoration until the end of world war ii the full title of japan was dai nippon teikoku meaning the empire of great japan 33 today the name

introduced to japan from baekje korea and was promoted by prince sh toku but the subsequent development of japanese buddhism was primarily influenced by china 44 despite early resistance buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the asuka period 592 710 45 the nara period 710 784 marked an emergence of the centralized japanese state centered on the imperial court in heij -ky modern nara the nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of buddhist-inspired art and architecture 46 the smallpox epidemic of 735 737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of japan s population 47 in 784 emperor kanmu moved the capital from nara to nagaoka-ky then to heian-ky modern kyoto in 794 this marked the beginning of the heian period 794 1185 during which a distinctly indigenous japanese culture emerged noted for its art poetry and prose murasaki shikibu s the tale of genji and the lyrics of japan s national anthem kimigayo were written during this time 48 buddhism began to spread during the heian era chiefly through two major sects tendai by saich and shingon by k kai pure land buddhism j do-sh j do shinsh became greatly popular in the latter half of the 11th century feudal era samurai warriors facing mongols during the mongol invasions of japan suenaga 1293 japan s feudal

minamoto no yoritomo was appointed sh gun by emperor go-toba and yoritomo established a base of power in kamakura after his death the h j clan came to power as regents for the sh guns the zen school of buddhism was introduced from china in the kamakura period 1185 1333 and became popular among the samurai class 49 the kamakura shogunate repelled mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by emperor go-daigo emperor go-daigo was himself defeated by ashikaga takauji in 1336 samurais could kill a commoner for the slightest insult and were widely feared by the japanese population edo period 1798 ashikaga takauji established the shogunate in muromachi kyoto this was the start of the muromachi period 1336 1573 the ashikaga shogunate achieved glory at the age of ashikaga yoshimitsu and the culture based on zen buddhism the art of miyabi prospered this evolved to higashiyama culture and prospered until the 16th century on the other hand the succeeding ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords daimy s and a civil war the nin war began in 1467 opening the century-long sengoku period warring states 50 during the 16th century traders and jesuit missionaries from portugal reached japan for the first time initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between japan and the west this allowed oda nobunaga to obtain european technology and firearms which he used to conquer many other daimy s his consolidation of power began what was known as the azuchi momoyama period 1573 1603 after nobunaga was assassinated in 1582 by akechi mitsuhide his successor toyotomi hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of korea in 1592 and 1597 tokugawa ieyasu served as regent for hideyoshi s son and used

1603 and established the tokugawa shogunate in edo modern tokyo 51 the shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy s 52 and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku closed country policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the edo period 1603 1868 53 the study of western sciences known as rangaku continued through contact with the dutch enclave at dejima in nagasaki the edo period also gave rise to kokugaku national studies the study of japan by the japanese 54 modern era emperor meiji 1868 1912 in whose name imperial rule was restored at the end of the tokugawa shogunate on march 31 1854 commodore matthew perry and the black ships of the united states navy forced the opening of japan to the outside world with the convention of kanagawa subsequent similar treaties with western countries in the bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises the resignation of the sh gun led to the boshin war and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor the meiji restoration 55 plunging itself through an active process of westernization during the meiji restoration in 1868 japan adopted western political judicial and military institutions and western cultural influences integrated with its traditional culture for modern industrialization the cabinet organized the privy council introduced the meiji constitution and assembled the imperial diet the meiji restoration transformed the empire of japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence after victories in the first sino-japanese war 1894 1895 and the russo-japanese war 1904 1905 japan gained control of taiwan korea and the southern half of sakhalin 56 japan s population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935 57 chinese generals surrendering to the japanese in the sino-japanese war of 1894 1895 world war i enabled japan on the side of the victorious allies to widen its influence and territorial holdings in asia the early 20th century saw a brief period of taish democracy 1912 1926 but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards fascism the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups the subsequent sh wa period initially saw the power of the military increased and brought about japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism that are a part of fascist ideology in 1931 japan invaded and occupied manchuria and following international condemnation of this occupation japan resigned from the league of nations in 1933 in 1936 japan signed the anti-comintern pact with germany and the 1940 tripartite pact made it one of the axis powers 58 in 1941 following its defeat in the brief soviet japanese border war japan negotiated the soviet japanese neutrality pact 59 which lasted until 1945 with the soviet invasion of manchuria 60 japanese officials surrendering to the allies on september 2 1945 in tokyo bay ending world war ii the empire of japan invaded other parts of china in 1937 precipitating the second sino-japanese war 1937 1945 the imperial japanese army swiftly captured the capital nanjing and conducted the nanking massacre 61 in 1940 the empire invaded french indochina after which the united states placed an oil embargo on japan 62 on december 7 8 1941 japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on pearl harbor british forces in malaya singapore and hong kong and declared war on the united states and the british empire bringing the united states and the united kingdom into world war ii in the pacific 63 64 after allied victories across the pacific during the next four years which culminated in the soviet invasion of manchuria and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on august 15 65 the war cost japan its colonies china and the war s other combatants tens of millions of lives and left much of japan s industry and infrastructure destroyed the allies led by the united states repatriated millions of ethnic japanese from colonies and military camps throughout asia largely eliminating the japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories 66 the allies also convened the international military tribunal for the far east on may 3 1946 to prosecute some japanese leaders for war crimes however the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the supreme commander for the allied powers despite calls for the trial of both groups 67 in 1947 japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices the allied occupation ended with the treaty of san francisco in 1952 68 and japan was granted membership in the united nations in 1956 japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world until surpassed by china in 2010 this ended in the mid-1990s when japan suffered a major recession in the beginning of the 21st century positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery 69 on march 11 2011 japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history this triggered the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power 70 geography japanese archipelago as seen from satellite japan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the pacific coast of east asia the country including all of the islands it controls lies between latitudes 24 and 46 n and longitudes 122 and 146 e the main islands from north to south are hokkaido honshu shikoku and kyushu the ryukyu islands which include okinawa are a chain to the south of kyushu together they are often known as the japanese archipelago 71 about 73 percent of japan is forested mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural industrial or residential use 7 72 as a result the habitable zones mainly located in coastal areas have extremely high population densities japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world 73 the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north the boso triple junction off the coast of japan is a triple junction where the north american plate the pacific plate and the philippine sea plate meets japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward opening the sea of japan around 15 million years ago 74 japan has 108 active volcanoes during the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged including sh wa-shinzan on hokkaido and my jin-sh off the bayonnaise rocks in the pacific destructive earthquakes often resulting in tsunami occur several times each century 75 the 1923 tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people 76 more recent major quakes are the 1995 great hanshin earthquake and the 2011 t hoku earthquake a 9.1-magnitude 77 quake which hit japan on march 11 2011 and triggered a large tsunami 70 japan is substantially prone to earthquakes tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the pacific ring of fire 78 it has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 world risk index 79 climate cherry blossoms of mount yoshino have been the subject of many plays and waka poetry autumn maple leaves momiji at kong bu-ji on mount k ya a unesco world heritage site the climate of japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south japan s geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones hokkaido sea of japan central highland seto inland sea pacific ocean and ryukyu islands the northernmost zone hokkaido has a humid continental climate with long cold winters and very warm to cool summers precipitation is not heavy but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter 80 in the sea of japan zone on honshu s west coast northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall in the summer the region is cooler than the pacific area though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn the central highland has a typical inland humid continental climate with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons as well as large diurnal variation precipitation is light though winters are usually snowy the mountains of the ch goku and shikoku regions shelter the seto inland sea from seasonal winds bringing mild weather year-round 80 the pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind the ryukyu islands have a subtropical climate with warm winters and hot summers precipitation is very heavy especially during the rainy season 80 the average winter temperature in japan is 5.1 c 41.2 f and the average summer temperature is 25.2 c 77.4 f 81 the highest temperature ever measured in japan 41.0 c 105.8 f was recorded on august 12 2013 82 the main rainy season begins in early may in okinawa and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching hokkaido in late july in most of honshu the rainy season begins before the middle of june and lasts about six weeks in late summer and early autumn typhoons often bring heavy rain 83 biodiversity the japanese macaques at jigokudani hot spring are notable for visiting the spa in the winter japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands they range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the ry ky and bonin islands to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands to temperate coniferous forests in the cold winter portions of the northern islands 84 japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife including the brown bear the japanese macaque the japanese raccoon dog the large japanese field mouse and the japanese giant salamander 85 a large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven ramsar wetland sites 86 87 four sites have been inscribed on the unesco world heritage list for their outstanding natural value 88 environment in the period of rapid economic growth after world war ii environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations as a result environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s responding to rising concern about the problem the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970 89 the oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of japan s lack of natural resources 90 current environmental issues include urban air pollution nox suspended particulate matter and toxics waste management water eutrophication nature conservation climate change chemical management and international co-operation for conservation 91 as of june 2015 more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in japan the ngo climate action network announced japan as the winner of its fossil of the day award for doing the most to block progress on climate action 92 japan ranks 20th in the 2018 environmental performance index which measures a nation s commitment to environmental sustainability 93 as the host and signatory of the 1997 kyoto protocol japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change 94 politics emperor akihito emperor since 1989 shinz abe prime minister since 2012 government japan is a constitutional monarchy whereby the power of the emperor is very limited as a ceremonial figurehead he is defined by the constitution to be the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people executive power is wielded chiefly by the prime minister and his cabinet while sovereignty is vested in the japanese people 95 japan s legislative body is the national diet seated in chiyoda tokyo the diet is a bicameral body comprising the lower house of representatives with 465 seats elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved and the upper house of councillors with 242 seats whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms there is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age 96 with a secret ballot for

building the prime minister of japan is the head of government and is appointed by the emperor after being designated by the diet from among its members the prime minister is the head of the cabinet and appoints and dismisses the ministers of state following the ldp s landslide victory in the 2012 general election shinz abe replaced yoshihiko noda as the prime minister on december 26 2012 97 historically influenced by chinese law the japanese legal system developed independently during the edo period through texts such as kujikata osadamegaki 98 however since the late 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of europe notably germany for example in 1896 the japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the german b rgerliches gesetzbuch with the code remaining in effect with post world war ii modifications 99 statutory law originates in japan s legislature and has the rubber stamp of the emperor japan s court system is divided into four basic tiers the supreme court and three levels of lower courts 100 the main body of japanese statutory law is called the six codes 101 administrative divisions japan consists of 47 prefectures each overseen by an elected governor legislature and administrative bureaucracy 102 each prefecture is further divided into cities towns and villages 103 the nation is currently undergoing administrative reorganization by merging many of the cities towns and villages with each other this process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions and is expected to cut administrative costs 104 foreign relations japanese prime minister shinz abe and u s president donald trump the liancourt rocks known as takeshima in japan has become an issue known as the liancourt rocks dispute japan has diplomatic relations with nearly all independent nations and has been an active member of the united nations since december 1956 japan is a member of the g8 apec and asean plus three and is a participant in the east asia summit japan signed a security pact with australia in march 2007 105 and with india in october 2008 106 it is the world s fifth largest donor of official development assistance donating us 9.2 billion in 2014 107 japan has close ties to the united states since japan s defeat by the united states and allies in world war ii the two countries have maintained close economic and defense relations the united states is a major market for japanese exports and the primary source of japanese imports and is committed to defending the country having military bases in japan for partially that purpose 108 japan contests russia s control of the southern kuril islands including etorofu kunashiri shikotan and the habomai group which were occupied by the soviet union in 1945 109 south korea s assertions concerning liancourt rocks japanese takeshima korean dokdo are acknowledged but not accepted by japan 110 japan has strained relations with the people s republic of china prc and the republic of china roc over the senkaku islands 111 and with the people s republic of china over the status of okinotorishima japan s relationship with south korea has been strained due to japan s treatment of koreans during japanese colonial rule particularly over the issue of comfort women 112 these women were essentially sex slaves and although there is no exact number on how many women were subjected to this treatment experts believe it could be in the tens or hundreds of thousands between 1910 1945 the japanese government rebuilt korean infrastructure introduced over 800,000 japanese immigrants onto the peninsula and carried out a campaign of cultural suppression through efforts to ban the korean language in schools and force koreans to adopt japanese names 113 with the surrender of japan and the axis at the end of wwii in 1945 the korean peninsula was once again independent despite their historical tensions in december 2015 japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with south korea by issuing a formal apology taking responsibility for the issue and paying money to the surviving comfort women today south korea and japan have a stronger and more economically-driven relationship since the 1990s the korean wave has created a large fanbase in east asia but most notably in japan japan is the number one importer of korean music k-pop television k-dramas and films but this was only made possible after the south korean government lifted the 30-year ban on cultural exchange with japan that had been in place since 1948 114 korean pop cultural products success in the japanese market is partially explained by the borrowing of japanese ideas such as the star-marketing system and heavy promotion of new television shows and music korean dramas such as winter sonata and coffee prince as well as k-pop artists such as bigbang and shinee are extremely popular with japanese consumers most recently south korean president moon jae-in met with japanese prime minister shinzo abe at the 2017 g-20 summit in hamburg germany to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for north korean aggression in the region both leaders restated their commitment to solving the comfort women dispute building positive relations in the region and pressuring china to be more assertive with north korea as it continues to test nuclear weapons and isolate themselves further form the international community 115 military jmsdf kong class destroyer jds kong ddg-173 a guided missile
