pressure ridge ice - wikipedia pressure ridge ice from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search hypothetical interaction between two floes resulting in a pressure ridge a linear pile-up of sea ice fragments field example of a pressure ridge only the sail is shown in this photograph the keel is more difficult to document although ice pressure ridges vary greatly in shape which also evolves in time this diagram shows how a drifting ridge is often idealized 1 2 a pressure ridge develops in an ice cover as a result of a stress regime established within the plane of the ice within sea ice expanses pressure ridges originate from the interaction between floes note 1 as they collide with each other 3 4 5 6 currents and winds are the main driving forces but the latter are particularly effective when they have a predominant direction 7 pressure ridges are made up of angular ice blocks of various sizes that pile up on the floes the part of the ridge that is above the water surface is known as the sail that below it as the keel note 2 pressure ridges are the thickest sea ice features and account for about one-half of the total sea ice volume 2 stamukhi are pressure ridges that are grounded and that result from the interaction between fast ice and the drifting pack ice 8 9 contents 1 internal structure 2 thickness 3 characterization methods 4 interest for pressure ridges 5 see also 6 notes 7 references internal structure edit the blocks making up pressure ridges are mostly from the thinner ice floe involved in the interaction but it can also include pieces from the other floe if it is not too thick 6 in the summer the ridge can undergo a significant amount of weathering which turns it into a smooth hill during this process the ice loses its salinity as a result of brine drainage this is known as an aged ridge 3 4 a consolidated ridge is one whose base has undergone complete freezing 3 4 the term consolidated layer is used to designate freezing up of the rubble just below the water line 7 the existence of a consolidated layer depends on air temperature in this layer the water between individual blocks is frozen with a resulting reduction in porosity and an increase in mechanical strength a keel s depth of an ice ridge is much higher than its sail s height - typically about four times the keel is also 2-3 times wider than the sail 10 thickness edit one of the largest pressure ridges on record had a sail extending 12 metres 39 ft above the water surface and a keel depth of 45 metres 148 ft 6 the total thickness for a multiyear ridge was reported to be 40 metres 130 ft 11 on average total thickness ranges between 5 metres 16 ft and 30 metres 98 ft 2 with a mean sail height that remains below 2 metres 6.6 ft 7 characterization methods edit the physical characterization of pressure ridges can be done using the following methods 7 mechanical drilling whereby augers designed for ice are driven through the ridge and the core retrieved for analysis surveying whereby a level theodolite or a differential gps system is used to determine sail geometry thermal drilling drilling involving melting of the ice observation of the ice canopy by scuba divers upward looking sonars a series of thermistors to monitor temperature changes electromagnetic induction from the ice surface or from an aircraft interest for pressure ridges edit from an offshore engineering and naval perspective there are three reasons why pressure ridges are a subject of investigation 2 firstly because the highest loads applied on offshore structures operating in cold oceans by drift ice are associated with these features secondly when pressure ridges drift into shallower areas their keel may come into contact with the seabed thereby representing a risk for subsea pipelines see seabed gouging by ice and other seabed installations thirdly they have a significant impact on navigation in the arctic ridged ice makes up about 40 of the overall mass of sea ice 10 see also edit wikimedia commons has media related to pressure ridge ice drift ice finger rafting iceberg offshore geotechnical engineering sea ice seabed gouging by ice stamukha submarine pipeline notes edit a floe designates any individual pieces of sea ice larger than 20 metres 66 ft these terms also apply for any floating ice feature such as icebergs references edit timco g w burden r p 1997 an analysis of the shapes of sea ice ridges cold regions science and technology 25 pp 65-77 a b c d lepp ranta m 2005 the drift of sea ice springer-verlag new york 266 p a b c http nsidc org cryosphere seaice index html a b c http www ec gc ca glaces-ice default asp lang en n 501d72c1-1 http www aari nw ru gdsidb xml volume1 php lang1 0 lang2 1 arrange 1 a b c weeks w f 2010 on sea ice university of alaska press fairbanks 664 p a b c d strub-klein l sudom d 2012 a comprehensive analysis of the morphology of first-year sea ice ridges cold regions science and technology 82 pp 94-109 barnes p w d mcdowell reimnitz e 1978 ice gouging characteristics their changing patterns from 1975-1977 beaufort sea alaska united states department of the interior geological survey open file report 78-730 menlo park u s a 42 p ogorodov s a arkhipov v v 2010 caspian sea bottom scouring by hummocky ice floes doklady earth sciences 432 1 pp 703-707 a b wadhams p 2000 ice in the ocean gordon and breach science publ london 351 p johnston m masterson d wright b 2009 multi-year ice thickness knowns and unknowns proceedings of the 20th international conference on port and ocean engineering under arctic conditions poac lule sweden retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title pressure ridge ice oldid 820644546 categories geomorphology landforms glaciology sea ice snow or ice weather phenomena navigation menu search this page was last edited on 15 january 2018 at 20 20 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
