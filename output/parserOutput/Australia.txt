the solomon islands and vanuatu to the north-east and new zealand to the south-east australia s capital is canberra and its largest city is sydney for about 50,000 years 13 before the first british settlement in the late 18th century 14 15 australia was inhabited by indigenous australians 16 who in documented times have spoken languages classifiable into roughly 250 groups 17 18 after the european discovery of the continent by dutch explorers in 1606 australia s eastern half was claimed by great britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of new south wales from 26 january 1788 the population grew steadily in subsequent decades and by the 1850s most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established on 1 january 1901 the six colonies federated forming the commonwealth of australia australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories australia has the world s 13th-largest economy and tenth-highest per capita income imf 19 with the second-highest

australis southern land a name used for a hypothetical continent in the southern hemisphere since ancient times 25 when europeans first began visiting and mapping australia in the 17th century the name terra australis was naturally applied to the new territories n 4 until the early 19th century australia was best known as new holland a name first applied by the dutch explorer abel tasman in 1644 as nieuw-holland and subsequently anglicised terra australis still saw occasional usage such as in scientific texts n 5 the name australia was popularised by the explorer matthew flinders who said it was more agreeable to the ear and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth 31 the first time that australia appears to have been officially used was in april 1817 in which governor lachlan macquarie acknowledged the receipt of flinders charts of australia from lord bathurst 32 in december 1817 macquarie recommended to the colonial office that it be formally adopted 33 in 1824 the admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name 34 the first official published use of the new name came with the 1830 publication of the australia directory by the hydrographic office 35 colloquial names for australia include oz and the land down under usually shortened to just down under other epithets include the great southern land the lucky country the sunburnt country and the wide brown land the latter two both derive from dorothea mackellar s 1908 poem my country 36 history pre-colonial history aboriginal rock art in the kimberley region of western australia human habitation of the australian continent is estimated to have begun around 65,000 to 70,000 years ago 37 38 with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea-crossings from what is now southeast asia these first inhabitants were the ancestors of modern indigenous australians 39 at the time of european settlement in the late 18th century most indigenous australians were hunter-gatherers with complex economies and societies 38 indigenous australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the dreamtime the torres strait islanders ethnically melanesian obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas 40 the northern coasts and waters of australia were visited sporadically by fishermen from maritime southeast asia 41 european arrival portrait of captain james cook the first european to map the eastern coastline of australia in 1770 the first recorded european sighting of the australian mainland and the first recorded european landfall on the australian continent in 1606 are attributed to the dutch the first ship and crew to chart the australian coast and meet with aboriginal people was the duyfken captained by dutch navigator willem janszoon 42 he sighted the coast of cape york peninsula in early 1606 and made landfall on 26 february at the pennefather river near the modern town of weipa on cape york 43 the dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent new holland during the 17th century but made no attempt at settlement 43 william dampier an english explorer and privateer landed on the north-west coast of new holland in 1688 and again in 1699 on a return trip 44 in 1770 james cook sailed along and mapped the east coast which he named new south wales and claimed for great britain 45 with the loss of its american colonies in 1783 the british government sent a fleet of ships the first fleet under the command of captain arthur phillip to establish a new penal colony in new south wales a camp was set up and the flag raised at sydney cove port jackson on 26 january 1788 15 a date which became australia s national day australia day although the british crown colony of new south wales was not formally promulgated until 7 february 1788 the first settlement led to the foundation of sydney and the exploration and settlement of other regions tasmania s port arthur penal settlement is one of eleven unesco world heritage-listed australian convict sites a british settlement was established in van diemen s land now known as tasmania in 1803 and it became a separate colony in 1825 46 the united kingdom formally claimed the western part of western australia the swan river colony in 1828 47 separate colonies were carved from parts of new south wales south australia in 1836 victoria in 1851 and queensland in 1859 48 the northern territory was founded in 1911 when it was excised from south australia 49 south australia was founded as a free province it was never a penal colony 50 victoria and western australia were also founded free but later accepted transported convicts 51 52 a campaign by the settlers of new south wales led to the end of convict transportation to that colony the last convict ship arrived in 1848 53 the indigenous population estimated to have been between 750,000 and 1,000,000 in 1788 54 declined for 150 years following settlement mainly due to infectious disease 55 thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers 56 a government policy of assimilation beginning with the aboriginal protection act 1869 resulted in the removal of many aboriginal children from their families and communities often referred to as the stolen generations a practice which may also have contributed to the decline in the indigenous population 57 as a result of the 1967 referendum the federal government s power to enact special laws with respect to a particular race was extended to enable the making of laws with respect to aborigines 58 traditional ownership of land native title was not recognised in law until 1992 when the high court of australia held in mabo v queensland no 2 that the legal doctrine that australia had been terra nullius land belonging to no one did not apply to australia at the time of british settlement 59 colonial expansion a gold rush began in australia in the early 1850s 60 and the eureka rebellion against mining licence fees in 1854 was an early expression of civil disobedience 61 between 1855 and 1890 the six colonies individually gained responsible government managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the british empire 62 the colonial office in london retained control of some matters notably foreign affairs 63 defence 64 and international shipping nationhood the last post is played at an anzac day ceremony in port melbourne victoria similar ceremonies are held in many suburbs and towns on 1 january 1901 federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning consultation and voting 65 this established the commonwealth of australia as a dominion of the british empire 66 67 the federal capital territory later renamed the australian capital territory was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of canberra melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while canberra was being constructed 68 the northern territory was transferred from the control of the south australian government to the federal parliament in 1911 69 in 1914 australia joined britain in fighting world war i with support from both the outgoing commonwealth liberal party and the incoming australian labor party 70 71 australians took part in many of the major battles fought on the western front 72 of about 416,000 who served about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded 73 many australians regard the defeat of the australian and new zealand army corps anzacs at gallipoli as the birth of the nation its first major military action 74 75 the kokoda track campaign is regarded by many as an analogous nation-defining event during world war ii 76 britain s statute of westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between australia and the uk australia adopted it in 1942 77 but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the australian parliament during world war ii 78 79 the shock of the united kingdom s defeat in asia in 1942 and the threat of japanese invasion caused australia to turn to the united states as a new ally and protector 80 since 1951 australia has been a formal military ally of the us under the anzus treaty 81 after world war ii australia encouraged immigration from mainland europe since the 1970s and following the abolition of the white australia policy immigration from asia and elsewhere was also promoted 82 as a result australia s demography culture and self-image were transformed 83 the passing of the australia act 1986 ended all possibility for any vestigial role of the british government in the government in australia and removed the already seldom-used option of judicial appeals to the privy council in london 84 in a 1999 referendum 55 of voters and a majority in every state rejected a proposal to become a republic with a president appointed by a two-thirds vote in both houses of the australian parliament since the election of the whitlam government in 1972 85 there has been an increasing focus in foreign policy on ties with other pacific rim nations while maintaining close ties with australia s traditional allies and trading partners 86 geography general characteristics topographic map of australia dark green represents the lowest elevation and dark brown the highest australia s landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres 2,941,300 sq mi 87 is on the indo-australian plate surrounded by the indian and pacific oceans n 6 it is separated from asia by the arafura and timor seas with the coral sea lying off the queensland coast and the tasman sea lying between australia and new zealand the world s smallest continent 89 and sixth largest country by total area 90 australia owing to its size and isolation is often dubbed the island continent 91 and is sometimes considered the world s largest island 92 australia has 34,218 kilometres 21,262 mi of coastline excluding all offshore islands 93 and claims an extensive exclusive economic zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres 3,146,060 sq mi this exclusive economic zone does not include the australian antarctic territory 94 apart from macquarie island australia lies between latitudes 9 and 44 s and longitudes 112 and 154 e the great barrier reef the world s largest coral reef 95 lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2,000 kilometres 1,240 mi mount augustus claimed to be the world s largest monolith 96 is located in western australia at 2,228 metres 7,310 ft mount kosciuszko on the great dividing range is the highest mountain on the australian mainland even taller are mawson peak at 2,745 metres or 9,006 feet on the remote australian territory of heard island and in the australian antarctic territory mount mcclintock and mount menzies at 3,492 metres 11,457 ft and 3,355 metres 11,007 ft respectively 97 uluru in the northern territory australia s size gives it a wide variety of landscapes with tropical rainforests in the north-east mountain ranges in the south-east south-west and east and dry desert in the centre 98 it is the flattest continent 99 with the oldest and least fertile soils 100 101 desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land 102 australia is the driest inhabited continent its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500 mm 103 the population density 2.8 inhabitants per square kilometre is among the lowest in the world 104 although a large proportion of the population lives along the temperate south-eastern coastline 105 eastern australia is marked by the great dividing range which runs parallel to the coast of queensland new south wales and much of victoria the name is not strictly accurate because parts of the range consist of low hills and the highlands are typically no more than 1,600 metres 5,249 ft in height 106 the coastal uplands and a belt of brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland 106 107 these include the western plains of new south wales and the einasleigh uplands barkly tableland and mulga lands of inland queensland the northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested cape york peninsula 108 109 110 111 the landscapes of the top end and the gulf country with their tropical climate include forest woodland wetland grassland rainforest and desert 112 113 114 at the north-west corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of the kimberley and below that the pilbara to the south of these and inland lie more areas of grassland the ord victoria plain and the western australian mulga shrublands 115 116 117 at the heart of the country are the uplands of central australia prominent features of the centre and south include uluru also known as ayers rock the famous sandstone monolith and the inland simpson tirari and sturt stony gibson great sandy tanami and great victoria deserts with the famous nullarbor plain on the southern coast 118 119 120 121 climate climatic zones in australia n 7 equatorial tropical subtropical desert grassland temperate the climate of australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents including the indian ocean dipole and the el ni o southern oscillation which is correlated with periodic drought and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern australia 122 123 these factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year much of the northern part of the country has a tropical predominantly summer-rainfall monsoon 103 the south-west corner of the country has a mediterranean climate 124 the south-east ranges from oceanic tasmania and coastal victoria to humid subtropical upper half of new south wales the interior is arid to semi-arid 103 according to the bureau of meteorology s 2011 australian climate statement australia had lower than average temperatures in 2011 as a consequence of a la ni a weather pattern however the country s 10-year average continues to demonstrate the rising trend in temperatures with 2002 2011 likely to rank in the top two warmest 10-year periods on record for australia at 0.52 c 0.94 f above the long-term average 125 furthermore 2014 was australia s third warmest year since national temperature observations commenced in 1910 126 127 water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought 128 129 throughout much of the continent major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought flushing out inland river systems overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains as occurred throughout eastern australia in 2010 2011 and 2012 after the 2000s australian drought australia s carbon dioxide emissions per capita are among the highest in the world lower than those of only a few other industrialised nations 130 a carbon tax was introduced in 2012 and helped to reduce australia s emissions but was scrapped in 2014 under the liberal government 131 since the carbon tax was repealed emissions have again continued to rise 132 biodiversity the koala and the eucalyptus form an iconic australian pair although most of australia is semi-arid or desert it includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests and is recognised as a megadiverse country fungi typify that diversity an estimated 250,000 species of which only 5 have been described occur in australia 133 because of the continent s great age extremely variable weather patterns and long-term geographic isolation much of australia s biota is unique about 85 of flowering plants 84 of mammals more than 45 of birds and 89 of in-shore temperate-zone fish are endemic 134 australia has the greatest number of reptiles of any country with 755 species 135 besides antarctica australia is the only continent that developed without feline species feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by dutch shipwrecks and later in the 18th century by european settlers they are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species 136 australian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts 137 among well-known australian animals are the monotremes the platypus and echidna a host of marsupials including the kangaroo koala and wombat and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra 137 australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world 138 the dingo was introduced by austronesian people who traded with indigenous australians around 3000 bce 139 many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement 140 including the australian megafauna others have disappeared since european settlement among them the thylacine 141 142 many of australia s ecoregions and the species within those regions are threatened by human activities and introduced animal chromistan fungal and plant species 143 all these factors have led to australia s having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world 144 the federal environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species 145 numerous protected areas have been created under the national strategy for the conservation of australia s biological diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems 146 147 65 wetlands are listed under the ramsar convention 148 and 16 natural world heritage sites have been established 149 australia was ranked 3rd out of 178 countries in the world on the 2014 environmental performance index 150 government and politics elizabeth ii queen of australia peter cosgrove governor-general of australia malcolm turnbull prime minister of australia australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy 151 with elizabeth ii at its apex as the queen of australia a role that is distinct from her position as monarch of the other commonwealth realms the queen is represented in australia by the governor-general at the federal level and by the governors at the state level who by convention act on the advice of her ministers 152 153 thus in practice the governor-general has no actual decision-making or de facto governmental role and merely acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the federal executive council the governor-general does have extraordinary reserve powers which may be exercised outside the prime minister s request in rare and limited circumstances the most notable exercise of which was the dismissal of the whitlam government in the constitutional crisis of 1975 154 the federal government is separated into three branches legislature the bicameral parliament defined in section 1 of the constitution as comprising the queen represented by the governor-general the senate and the house of representatives executive the federal executive council which in practice gives legal effect to the decisions of the cabinet comprising the prime minister and ministers of state who advise the governor-general 155 judiciary the high court of australia and other federal courts whose judges are appointed by the governor-general on advice of the federal executive council parliament house canberra in the senate the upper house there are 76 senators twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories the australian capital territory and the northern territory 156 the house of representatives the lower house has 150 members elected from single-member electoral divisions commonly known as electorates or seats allocated to states on the basis of population 157 with each original state guaranteed a minimum of five seats 158 elections for both chambers are normally held every three years simultaneously senators have overlapping six-year terms except for those from the territories whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house thus only 40 of the 76 places in the senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution 156 australia s electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of tasmania and the act which along with the senate and most state upper houses combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every jurisdiction 159 as is enrolment with the exception of south australia 160 the party with majority support in the house of representatives forms the government and its leader becomes prime minister in cases where no party has majority support the governor-general has the constitutional power to appoint the prime minister and if necessary dismiss one that has lost the confidence of parliament 161 there are two major political groups that usually form government federally and in the states the australian labor party and the coalition which is a formal grouping of the liberal party and its minor partner the national party 162 163 within australian political culture the coalition is considered centre-right and the labor party is considered centre-left 164 independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in australian parliaments mostly in upper houses in september 2015 malcolm turnbull successfully challenged tony abbott for leadership of the coalition and was sworn in as the 29th prime minister of australia 165 the most recent federal election was held on 2 july 2016 and resulted in the coalition s forming a majority government 166 states and territories a clickable map of australia s states mainland territories and their capitals australia has six states new south wales nsw queensland qld south australia sa tasmania tas victoria vic and western australia wa and two major mainland territories the australian capital territory act and the northern territory nt in most respects these two territories function as states except that the commonwealth parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments 167 under the constitution the states essentially have plenary legislative power to legislate on any subject whereas the commonwealth federal parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under section 51 for example state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education criminal law and state police health transport and local government but the commonwealth parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas 168 however commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency 169 in addition the commonwealth has the power to levy income tax which coupled with the power to make grants to states has given it the financial means to incentivize states to pursue specific legislative agendas within areas over which the commonwealth does not have legislative power each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament unicameral in the northern territory the act and queensland and bicameral in the other states the states are sovereign entities although subject to certain powers of the commonwealth as defined by the constitution the lower houses are known as the legislative assembly the house of assembly in south australia and tasmania the upper houses are known as the legislative council the head of the government in each state is the premier and in each territory the chief minister the queen is represented in each state by a governor and in the northern territory the administrator 170 in the commonwealth the queen s representative is the governor-general 171 the commonwealth parliament also directly administers the following external territories ashmore and cartier islands australian antarctic territory christmas island cocos keeling islands coral sea islands heard island and mcdonald islands and jervis bay territory a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of new south wales 155 the external territory of norfolk island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the norfolk island act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an administrator to represent the queen 172 in 2015 the commonwealth parliament abolished self-government integrating norfolk island into the australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council 173 macquarie island is administered by tasmania and lord howe island by new south wales foreign relations over recent decades australia s foreign relations have been driven by a close association with the united states through the anzus pact and by a desire to develop relationships with asia and the pacific particularly through asean and the pacific islands forum in 2005 australia secured an inaugural seat at the east asia summit following its accession to the treaty of amity and cooperation in southeast asia and in 2011 attended the sixth east asia summit in indonesia australia is a member of the commonwealth of nations in which the commonwealth heads of government meetings provide the main forum for co-operation 174 australia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation 175 it led the formation of the cairns group and asia-pacific economic cooperation 176 177 australia is a member of the organisation for economic co-operation and development and the world trade organization 178 179 and has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements most recently the australia united states free trade agreement 180 and closer economic relations with new zealand 181 with another free trade agreement being negotiated with china the australia china free trade agreement and japan 182 south korea in 2011 183 184 australia chile free trade agreement and as
