subtropics - wikipedia subtropics from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the subtropics and tropics citation needed areas of the world with subtropical climates according to k ppen climate classification the subtropics are geographic and climate zones located roughly between the tropics at latitude 23.5 the tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn and temperate zones normally referring to latitudes 35 66.5 north and south of the equator subtropical climates are often characterized by warm to hot summers and cool to mild winters with infrequent frost most subtropical climates fall into two basic types - humid subtropical where rainfall is often concentrated in the warmest months for example brisbane queensland or jacksonville florida and dry summer or mediterranean where seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the cooler months for example naples italy or los angeles california subtropical climates can occur at high elevations within the tropics such as in the southern end of the mexican plateau and in vietnam and taiwan six climate classifications use the term to help define the various temperature and precipitation regimes for the planet earth a great portion of the world s deserts are located within the subtropics due to the development of the subtropical ridge within savanna regimes in the subtropics a wet season is seen annually during the summer which is when most of the yearly rainfall falls within mediterranean climate regimes the wet season occurs during the winter areas bordering warm oceans are prone to locally heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones which can contribute a significant percentage of the annual rainfall plants such as palms citrus mango pistachio lychee and avocado are grown within the subtropics contents 1

historically defined as lying between the tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn located at 23.45 north and south latitude respectively 1 the poleward fringe of the subtropics is located at approximately 40 north and south latitude respectively 2 temperatures edit tadrart acacus desert part of the sahara in western libya several methods have been used to define the subtropical climate in the trewartha climate classification a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature greater than 10 c 50.0 f and at least one month with a mean temperature under 18 c 64.4 f 3 german climatologists carl troll and karlheinz paffen defined warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between 2 c 35.6 f and 13 c 55.4 f in the northern hemisphere and between 6 c 42.8 f and 13 c 55.4 f in the southern hemisphere excluding oceanic and continental climates according to the troll-paffen climate classification there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone 4 which is subdivided into seven smaller areas 5 according to the e neef climate classification the subtropical zone is divided into two parts rainy winters of the west sides and eastern subtropical climate 6 according to the wilhelm lauer peter frankenberg climate classification the subtropical zone is divided into three parts high-continental continental and maritime 7 according to the siegmund frankenberg climate classification subtropical is one of six climate zones in the world 8 rainfall edit hadley cells located on the earth s atmospheric circulation heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone the upper-level divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft as the air moves towards the mid-latitudes it cools and sinks which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres this circulation is known as the hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge 9 many of the world s deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure areas 10 located within the subtropics this regime is known as an arid subtropical climate which is generally located in areas adjacent to powerful cold ocean currents examples of this climate are the coastal areas of southern africa namibia south africa the south of the canary islands and the coasts of peru and chile 11 the humid or monsoon subtropical climate is often located on the western side of the subtropical high here unstable tropical airmasses in summer bring convective overturning and frequent tropical downpours in the hot season in the winter dry season the monsoon retreats and the drier trade winds bring more stable airmass and often dry weather areas that have this type of subtropical climate include australia southeast asia parts of south america and the deep south of the united states 12 13 14 monsoon regions with a wet season include western mexico 15 the desert southwest of the united states 16 within the mediterranean climate regime the west coast of the united states and the mediterranean coastline of italy greece 17 and turkey experience a wet season in the winter months 18 similarly the wet season in the negev desert of israel extends from october through may 19 at the boundary between the mediterranean and monsoon climates in north america lies the sonoran desert which receives the two rainy seasons associated with each climate regime 20 in areas bounded by warm ocean tropical cyclones can contribute significantly to local rainfall within the subtropics 21 japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons 22 flora edit curitiba brazil live oak with araucarias these climates do not routinely see hard frosts or snow which allows plants such as palms and citrus to flourish 23 24 as one moves toward the tropical side the slight winter cool season disappears while at the poleward threshold of the subtropics the winters become cooler some crops which have been traditionally farmed in tropical climates such as mango litchi and avocado are cultivated in the subtropics pest control of the crops is less difficult than within the tropics due to the cooler winters 25 tree ferns pteridophytes are grown within subtropical areas primarily within the subtropics and within topography within the tropics dracaena and yucca can grow within the subtropics trees within the taxaceae family grow within subtropical climate regimes apple pear and pomegranates grow well within the subtropics 26 varieties edit humid variation edit wetland park in hong kong the humid subtropical climate is a subtropical climate type characterized by hot humid summers with frequent tropical downpours of short duration and warm and frequently dry winters in summer the subtropical high pressure cells bring a sultry flow of tropical air with high dew points and daily thundershowers are typical though brief normally rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months of the year at times the average annual precipitation may be more evenly distributed throughout the year or a spring maximum is present with decreasing latitude most humid subtropical climates typically have drier winters and wetter summers humid subtropical climates lie on the lower east side of continents roughly between latitudes 25 and 35 degrees away from the equator in the united states the humid subtropical zone is normally considered the region from central florida north to southeast north carolina 27 hong kong climate chart explanation j f m a m j j a s o n d 25 19 14 52 19 14 71 22 17 189 25 21 330 28 24 388 30 26 374 31 27 445 31 26 288
