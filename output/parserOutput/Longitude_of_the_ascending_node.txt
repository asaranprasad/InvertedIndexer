longitude of the ascending node - wikipedia longitude of the ascending node from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article may be confusing or unclear to readers please help us clarify the article there might be a discussion about this on the talk page july 2009 learn how and when to remove this template message the longitude of the ascending node the longitude of the ascending node or is one of the orbital elements used to specify the orbit of an object in space it is the angle from a reference direction called the origin of longitude to the direction of the ascending node measured in a reference plane 1 the ascending node is the point where the orbit of the object passes through the plane of reference as seen in the adjacent image commonly used reference planes and origins of longitude include for a geocentric orbit earth s equatorial plane as the reference plane and the first point of aries as the origin of longitude in this case the longitude is also called the right ascension of the ascending node or raan the angle is measured eastwards or as seen from the north counterclockwise from the first point of aries to the node 2 3 for a heliocentric orbit the ecliptic as the reference plane and the first point of aries as the origin of longitude the angle is measured counterclockwise as seen from north of the ecliptic from the first point of aries to the node 2 for an orbit outside the solar system the plane through the primary perpendicular to a line through the observer and the primary called the plane of the sky as the reference plane and north i e the perpendicular projection of the direction from the observer to the north celestial pole onto the plane of the sky as the origin of longitude the angle is measured eastwards or as seen by the observer counterclockwise from north to the node 4 pp 40 72 137 5 chap 17 in the case of a binary star known only from visual observations it is not possible to tell which node is ascending and which is descending in this case the orbital parameter which is recorded is the longitude of the node which is the longitude of whichever node has a longitude between 0 and 180 degrees 5 chap 17 4 p 72 calculation from state vectors edit in astrodynamics the longitude of the ascending node can be calculated from the specific relative angular momentum vector h as follows n k h h y h x 0 arccos n x n n y 0 2 arccos n x n n y 0 displaystyle begin aligned mathbf n mathbf k times mathbf h -h y h x ,0 omega begin cases arccos n x over mathbf left n right n y geq 0 2 pi - arccos n x over mathbf left n right n y 0 end cases end aligned here n nx ny nz is a vector pointing towards the ascending node the reference plane is assumed to be the xy-plane and the origin of longitude is taken to be the positive x-axis k is the unit vector 0 0 1 which is the normal vector to the xy reference plane for non-inclined orbits with inclination equal to zero is undefined for computation it is then by convention set equal to zero that is the ascending node is placed in the reference direction which is equivalent to letting n point towards the positive x-axis see also edit kepler orbits equinox orbital node perturbation of the orbital plane can cause revolution of the ascending node references edit web page accessed may 17 2007 a b 2007-04-03 at the wayback machine robert a egler dept of physics north carolina state university web page accessed may 17 2007 amsat org accessed may 17 2007 a b the binary stars r g aitken new york semi-centennial publications of the university of california 1918 a b jeremy b tatum on line accessed may 17 2007 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title longitude of the ascending node oldid 818843226 categories orbits hidden categories webarchive template wayback links wikipedia articles needing clarification from july 2009 all wikipedia articles needing clarification navigation menu search this page was last edited on 5 january 2018 at 22 37 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
