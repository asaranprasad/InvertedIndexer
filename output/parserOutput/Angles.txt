jutland peninsula in today s germany and denmark the angles latin angli were one of the main germanic peoples who settled in great britain in the post-roman period they founded several of the kingdoms of anglo-saxon england and their name is the root of the name england the name comes from anglia angeln a peninsula located on the baltic shore of what is now schleswig-holstein contents 1 name 2

angles may have been first recorded in latinised form as anglii in the germania of tacitus it is thought to derive from the name of the area they originally inhabited the anglia peninsula angeln in modern german angel in danish this name has been hypothesised to originate from the germanic root for narrow compare german and dutch eng narrow meaning the narrow water i e the schlei estuary the root would be angh tight another theory is that the name meant hook as in angling for fish indo-european linguist julius pokorny derives it from ang- bend see ankle 1 during the 9th century all germanic tribes who invaded britain were referred to as englisc who were speakers of old english which was known as englisc nglisc or anglisc englisc also goes back to proto-indo-european h en - meaning narrow 2 in any case the angles may have been called such because they were a fishing people or were originally descended from such and therefore england would mean land of the fishermen and english would be the fishermen s language 3 gregory the great in an epistle simplified the latinised name anglii to angli the latter form developing into the preferred form of the word the country remained anglia in latin alfred the great s translation of orosius s history of the world uses angelcynn -kin to describe england and the english people bede used angelfolc -folk there are also such forms as engel englan the people englaland englisc all showing i-mutation 4 greco-roman historiography edit tacitus edit the map shows both the anglia angeln and the schwansen peninsulas possible locations of the angles and jutes before their migration to britain the earliest recorded mention of the angles may be in chapter 40 of tacitus s germania written around ad 98 tacitus describes the anglii as one of the more remote suebic tribes compared to the semnones and langobardi who lived on the elbe and were better known to the romans he grouped the angles with several other tribes in that region the reudigni aviones varini eudoses suarini and nuitones 5 6 these were all living behind ramparts of rivers and woods and therefore inaccessible to attack 5 6 he gives no precise indication of their geographical situation but states that together with the six other tribes they worshiped nerthus or mother earth whose sanctuary was located on an island in the ocean 7 the eudoses are the jutes these names probably refer to localities in jutland or on the baltic coast the coast contains sufficient estuaries inlets rivers islands swamps and marshes to have been then inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain such as the romans who considered it unknown inaccessible with a small population and of little economic interest the majority of scholars believe that the anglii lived on the coasts of the baltic sea probably in the southern part of the jutish peninsula this view is based partly on old english and danish traditions regarding persons and events of the 4th century and partly on the fact that striking affinities to the cult of nerthus as described by tacitus are to be found in pre-christian scandinavian religion 7 ptolemy edit ptolemy writing in around ad150 in his atlas geography 2.10 describes the sueboi angeilloi latinised to suevi angili further south living in a stretch of land between the northern rhine and central elbe but apparently not touching either river with the suebic langobardi on the rhine to their west and the suebic semnones on the elbe stretching to their east these suevi angili would have been in lower saxony or near it but they are not coastal the three suebic peoples are separated from the coastal chauci between ems and elbe and saxones east of the elbe mouth by a series of tribes including between weser and elbe the angrivarii laccobardi probably another reference to langobardi but taken by ptolemy from another source and dulgubnii south of the saxons and east of the elbe ptolemy lists ouirounoi latinised as viruni and probably the varini and teutonoari which either denotes the teuton men or else it denotes people living in the area where the teutons had previously lived who ptolemy places still living to the east of the teutonoari ptolemy describes the coast to the east of the saxons as inhabited by the farodini a name not known from any other sources owing to the uncertainty of this passage there has been much speculation regarding the original home of the anglii one theory is that they or part of them dwelt or moved among other coastal people perhaps confederated up to the basin of the saale in the neighbourhood of the ancient canton of engilin on the unstrut valleys below the kyffh userkreis from which region the lex anglorum et werinorum hoc est thuringorum is believed by many to have come 7 8 the ethnic names of frisians and warines are also attested in these saxon districts a second possible solution is that these angles of ptolemy are not those of schleswig at all according to julius pokorny the angri- in angrivarii the -angr in hardanger and the angl- in anglii all come from the same root meaning bend but in different senses in other words the similarity of the names is strictly coincidental and does not reflect any ethnic unity beyond germanic on the other hand gudmund sch tte in his analysis of ptolemy believes that the angles have simply been moved by an error coming from ptolemy s use of imperfect sources he points out that angles are placed correctly just to the northeast of the langobardi but that these have been duplicated so that they appear once correctly on the lower elbe and a second time incorrectly at the northern rhine 9 medieval historiography edit manuscript of bede bede states that the anglii before coming to great britain dwelt in a land called angulus which lies between the province of the jutes and the saxons and remains unpopulated to this day similar evidence is given by the historia brittonum king alfred the great and the chronicler thelweard identified this place with the district that is now called angeln in the province of schleswig slesvig though it may then have been of greater extent and this identification agrees with the indications given by bede 7 in the norwegian seafarer ohthere of h logaland s account of a two-day voyage from the oslo fjord to schleswig he reported the lands on his starboard bow and alfred appended the note on these islands dwelt the engle before they came hither n 1 confirmation is afforded by english and danish traditions relating to two kings named wermund and offa of angel from whom the mercian royal family claimed descent and whose exploits are connected with angeln schleswig and rendsburg danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of schleswig father and son in their service frowinus freawine and wigo wig from whom the royal family of wessex claimed descent during the 5th century the anglii invaded great britain after which time their name does not recur on the continent except in the title of the legal code issued to the thuringians lex anglorum et werinorum hoc est thuringorum 7 8 the angles are the subject of a legend about pope gregory i who happened to see a group of angle children from deira for sale as slaves in the roman market as the story would later be told by the anglo-saxon monk and historian bede gregory was struck by the unusual appearance of the slaves and asked about their background when told they were called anglii angles he replied with a latin pun that translates well into english bene nam et angelicam habent faciem et tales angelorum in caelis decet esse coheredes it is well for they have an angelic face and such people ought to be co-heirs of the angels in heaven supposedly this encounter inspired the pope to launch a mission to bring christianity to their countrymen 12 13 archaeology edit the province of schleswig has proved rich in prehistoric antiquities that date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries a large cremation cemetery has been found at borgstedt between rendsburg and eckernf rde and it has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in pagan graves in england of still greater importance are the great deposits at thorsberg moor in angeln and nydam which contained large quantities of arms ornaments articles of clothing agricultural implements etc and in nydam even ships by the help of these discoveries angle culture in the age preceding the invasion of britannia can be pieced together 7 anglian kingdoms in england edit angles saxons and jutes throughout england according to sources such as the history of bede after the invasion of britannia the angles split up and founded the kingdoms of northumbria east anglia and mercia h r loyn has observed in this context that a sea voyage is perilous to tribal institutions 14 and the apparently tribe-based kingdoms were formed in england in early times there were two northern kingdoms bernicia and deira and two midland ones middle anglia and mercia which had by the 7th century resolved themselves into two angle kingdoms viz northumbria and mercia northumbria held suzerainty amidst the teutonic presence in the british isles in the 7th century but was eclipsed by the rise of mercia in the 8th century both kingdoms fell in the great assaults of the danish viking armies in the 9th century their royal houses were effectively destroyed in the fighting and their angle populations came under the danelaw further south the saxon kings of wessex withstood the danish assaults then in the late 9th and early 10th centuries the kings of wessex defeated the danes and liberated the angles from the danelaw they united their house in marriage with the surviving angle royalty and were accepted by the angles as their kings this marked the passing of the old anglo-saxon world and the dawn of the english as a new people the regions of east anglia and northumbria are still known by their original titles northumbria once stretched as far north as what is now southeast scotland including edinburgh and as far south as the humber estuary the rest of that people stayed at the centre of the angle homeland in the northeastern portion of the modern german bundesland of schleswig-holstein on the jutland peninsula there a small peninsular area is still called angeln today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern flensburg on the flensburger fjord to the city of schleswig and then to maasholm on the schlei inlet see also edit angeln anglo-saxons east anglia
