mission of nasa and the german aerospace center twin satellites took detailed measurements of earth s gravity field anomalies from its launch in march 2002 to the end of its science mission in october 2017 by measuring gravity anomalies grace showed how mass is distributed around the planet and how it varies over time data from the grace satellites is an important tool for studying earth s ocean geology and climate grace was a collaborative endeavor involving the center for space research at the university of texas at austin nasa s jet propulsion laboratory the german space agency and germany s national research center for geosciences potsdam 8 the jet propulsion laboratory was responsible for the overall mission management under the nasa essp program the principal investigator is byron tapley of the university of texas center for space research and the co-principal investigator is christoph reigber of the geoforschungszentrum gfz potsdam 9 the two grace satellites grace-1 and grace-2 were launched from plesetsk cosmodrome russia on a rockot ss-19 breeze upper stage launch vehicle on 17 march 2002 the spacecraft were launched to an initial altitude of approximately 500 km at a near-polar inclination of 89 during normal operations the satellites were separated by approximately 200 km along their orbit track grace far exceeded its five-year design lifespan operating for fifteen years until the decommissioning of grace-2 on 27 october 2017 6 its successor grace-fo is expected to launch in early 2018 10 contents 1 discoveries and applications 1.1 oceanography hydrology

discoveries and applications edit gravity anomaly map from grace variations in ocean bottom pressure measured by grace the monthly gravity anomalies maps generated by grace are up to 1,000 times more accurate than previous maps substantially improving the accuracy of many techniques used by oceanographers hydrologists glaciologists geologists and other scientists to study phenomena that influence climate 11 from the thinning of ice sheets to the flow of water through aquifers and the slow currents of magma inside earth mass measurements provided by grace help scientists better understand these important natural processes oceanography hydrology and ice sheets edit grace chiefly detected changes in the distribution of water across the planet scientists use grace data to estimate ocean bottom pressure as important to oceanographers as atmospheric pressure is to meteorologists 12 grace data are also critical in helping to determine the cause of sea level rise whether it is the result of mass being added to the ocean from melting glaciers for example or from thermal expansion of warming water or changes in salinity 13 high-resolution static gravity fields estimated from grace data have helped improve the understanding of global ocean circulation the hills and valleys in the ocean s surface ocean surface topography are due to currents and variations in earth s gravity field grace enables separation of those two effects to better measure ocean currents and their effect on climate 12 grace data have provided a record of mass loss within the ice sheets of greenland and antarctica greenland has been found to lose 7014280000000000000 280 58 gt of ice per year between 2003 and 2013 while antarctica has lost 7013670000000000000 67 44 gt per year in the same period 14 these equate to a total of 0.9 mm yr of sea level rise grace data have also provided insights into regional hydrology inaccessible to other forms of remote sensing for example groundwater depletion in india 15 and california 16 the annual hydrology of the amazon basin provides an especially strong signal when viewed by grace 17 a university of california irvine-led study published in water resources research on 16 june 2015 used grace data between 2003 and 2013 to conclude that 21 of the world s 37 largest aquifers have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted and thirteen of them are considered significantly distressed the most over-stressed is the arabian aquifer system upon which more than 60 million people depend for water 18 geophysics edit change in mass of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets as measured by grace grace also detects changes in the gravity field due to geophysical processes glacial isostatic adjustment the slow rise of land masses once depressed by the weight of ice sheets from the last ice age is chief among these signals gia signals appear as secular trends in gravity field measurements and must be removed to accurately estimate changes in water and ice mass in a region 19 grace is also sensitive to permanent changes in the gravity field due to earthquakes for instance grace data have been used to analyze the shifts in the earth s crust caused by the earthquake that created the 2004 indian ocean tsunami 20 in 2006 a team of researchers led by ralph von frese and laramie potts used grace data to discover the 480-kilometer-wide 300 mi wilkes land crater in antarctica which were probably formed about 250 million years ago 21 other signals edit grace is sensitive to regional variations in the mass of the atmosphere atmospheric pressure and high-frequency variation in ocean bottom pressure these variations are well understood and are removed from monthly gravity estimates using forecast models to prevent aliasing 22 nonetheless errors in these models do influence grace solutions 23 grace data also contribute to fundamental physics they have been used to re-analyze data obtained from the lageos experiment to try to measure the relativistic frame-dragging effect 24 25 spacecraft edit diagrams illustrating the systems and instruments aboard the grace spacecraft global gravity anomaly animations over land and oceans by grace the spacecraft were manufactured by astrium of germany using its flexbus platform the microwave rf systems and attitude determination and control system algorithms were provided by space systems loral the star cameras used to measure the spacecraft attitude were provided by technical university of denmark the instrument computer along with a highly precise blackjack gps receiver and digital signal processing system was provided by jpl in pasadena the highly precise accelerometer that is needed to separate atmospheric and solar radiation pressure effects from the gravitation data was manufactured by onera measurement principle edit grace is the first earth-monitoring mission in the history of space flight whose key measurement is not derived from electromagnetic waves either reflected off emitted by or transmitted through earth s surface and or atmosphere instead the mission uses a microwave ranging system to accurately measure changes in the speed and distance between two identical spacecraft flying in a polar orbit about 220 kilometers 140 mi apart 500 kilometers 310 mi above earth the ranging system is sensitive enough to detect separation changes as small as 10 micrometers approximately one-tenth the width of a human hair over a distance of 220 kilometers 4 as the twin grace satellites circle the globe 15 times a day they sense minute variations in earth s gravitational pull when the first satellite passes over a region of slightly stronger gravity a gravity anomaly it is pulled slightly ahead of the trailing satellite this causes the distance between the satellites to increase the first spacecraft then passes the anomaly and slows down again meanwhile the following spacecraft accelerates then decelerates over the same point by measuring the constantly changing distance between the two satellites and combining that data with precise positioning measurements from global positioning system gps instruments scientists can construct a detailed map of earth s gravity anomalies instruments edit the two satellites nicknamed tom and jerry constantly maintain a two-way k-band microwave-ranging link between them fine distance measurements are made by comparing frequency shifts of the link the micrometer-sensitivity of this measurement requires accordingly precise measurements of each spacecraft s position motion and orientation to be useful to remove the effect of external non-gravitational forces e g drag solar radiation pressure the vehicles use sensitive super star electrostatic accelerometers located near their respective centers of mass gps receivers are used to establish the precise positions of each satellite along the baseline between the satellites the satellites use star cameras and magnetometers to establish attitude the grace vehicles also have optical corner reflectors to enable laser ranging from ground stations data products edit csr gfz and jpl process observations and ancillary data downloaded from grace to produce monthly geopotential models of earth 26 these models are distributed as spherical harmonic coefficients with a maximum degree of 60 degree 90 products are also available these products have a typical latency of 1 2 months these geopotential coefficients may be used to compute geoid height gravity anomalies and changes in the distribution of mass on earth s surface 27 gridded products estimating changes in mass in units of liquid water equivalent thickness are available at jpl s grace tellus website end of mission edit following an age-related battery issue on grace-2 in september 2017 it became apparent that grace-2 s remaining battery capacity would not be sufficient to operate therefore it was decided in mid-october to decommission the grace-2 satellite and end grace s science mission 6 atmospheric reentry of grace-2 occurred on 24 december 2017 at approximately 00 16 utc 7 atmospheric reentry of grace-1 is predicted to occur in late february 2018 6 grace follow-on edit nasa and the gfz potsdam have announced a follow-on of the grace mission the grace-fo mission will be a collaboration between nasa and gfz and is scheduled to be launched on 28 april 2018 utc aboard a spacex falcon 9 rocket from vandenberg afb california sharing the launch with iridium 28 29 10 the orbit and the design of grace-fo will be very similar to grace in addition to the proven microwave ranging system used on the grace mission the distance between the two spacecraft of grace-fo will also be measured with laser ranging as a technological experiment in preparation for future satellites 30 31 see also edit gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer an esa gravity mapping mission gravity recovery
