glossing abbreviation art is a word that is used with a noun as a standalone word or a prefix or suffix to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope the articles in english grammar are the and a an and in certain contexts some an and a are modern forms of the old english an which in anglian dialects was the number one compare on in saxon dialects and survived into modern scots as the number owan both on respelled one by the norman language and an survived into modern english with one used as the number and an a before nouns that begin with a consonant sound as an indefinite article in many languages articles are a special part of speech which cannot easily be combined clarification needed with other parts of speech in english grammar articles are frequently considered part of a broader category called determiners which contains articles demonstratives such as this and that possessive determiners such as my and his and quantifiers such as all and few 1 articles and other determiners are also sometimes counted as a type of adjective since they describe the words that they come before 2 in languages that employ articles every common noun with some exceptions is expressed with a certain definiteness definite or indefinite as an attribute similar to how many languages express every noun with a certain grammatical number singular or plural or a grammatical gender articles are among the most common words in many languages in english for example the most frequent word is the 3 articles are usually categorized as either definite or indefinite 4 a few languages with well-developed systems of articles may distinguish additional subtypes within each type languages may have various forms of each article due to confirming to grammatical attributes such as gender number or case articles may also be modified as influenced by adjacent sounds or words as in elision e g french le becoming l before a vowel epenthesis e g english a becoming an before a vowel or contraction e g irish i na becoming sna contents 1 definite article 2 indefinite article 3 proper article 4 partitive article 5 negative article 6 zero article 7 variation among languages 7.1 tokelauan 8 evolution 8.1 definite articles 8.2 indefinite articles 9 see also 10 references 11 external links definite article edit the definite article is used to refer to a particular member of a group or class it may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be something uniquely specified there is one definite article in english for both singular and plural nouns the the children know the fastest way home the sentence above refers to specific children and a specific way home it contrasts with the much more general observation that children know the fastest ways home the latter sentence refers to children in general and their specific ways home likewise give me the book refers to a specific book whose identity is known or obvious to the listener as such it has a markedly different meaning from give me a book which uses an indefinite article which does not specify what book is to be given the definite article can also be used in english to indicate a specific class among other classes the cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the brassica genus however recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to lexicalization under this point of view definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article clarification needed 5 6 indefinite article edit an indefinite article indicates that its noun is not a particular one identifiable to the listener it may be something that the speaker is mentioning for the first time or the speaker may be making a general statement about any such thing a an are the indefinite articles used in english the form an is used before words that begin with a vowel sound even if spelled with an initial consonant as in an hour and a before words that begin with a consonant sound even if spelled with a vowel as in a european she had a house so large that an elephant would get lost without a map before some words beginning with a pronounced not silent h in an unstressed first syllable such as historic al hallucination hilarious horrendous and horrific some especially older british writers prefer to use an over a an historical event etc 7 an is also preferred before hotel by some writers of british english probably reflecting the relatively recent adoption of the word from french in which the h is not pronounced 8 the use of an before words beginning with an unstressed h is more common generally in british english than in american 8 american writers normally use a in all these cases although there are occasional uses of an historic al in american english 9 according to the new oxford dictionary of english such use is increasingly rare in british english too 7 unlike british english american english typically uses an before herb since the h in this word is silent for most americans the correct usage in respect of the term hereditary peer was the subject of an amendment debated in the uk parliament 10 the word some can be viewed as functionally a plural of a an in that for example an apple never means more than one apple but give me some apples indicates more than one is desired but without specifying a quantity in this view it is functionally homologous to the spanish plural indefinite article unos unas un una one is completely indistinguishable from the unit number except where it has a plural form unos unas thus dame una manzana give me an apple but dame unas manzanas give me some apples the indefiniteness of some or unos can sometimes be semiquantitatively narrowed as in there are some apples there but not many some also serves as a singular indefinite article as in there is some person on the porch proper article edit a proper article indicates that its noun is proper and refers to a unique entity it may be the name of a person the name of a place the name of a planet etc the maori language has the proper article a which is used for personal nouns so a pita means peter in maori when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article as an important part of it both articles are present for example the phrase a te rauparaha which contains both the proper article a and the definite article te refers to the person name te rauparaha the definite article is sometimes also used with proper names which are already specified by definition there is just one of them for example the amazon the hebrides in these cases the definite article may be considered superfluous its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier i e the amazon river the hebridean islands where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted the definite article is universally kept the united states the people s republic of china this distinction can sometimes become a political matter the former usage the ukraine stressed the word s russian meaning of borderlands as ukraine became a fully independent state following the collapse of the soviet union it requested that formal mentions of its name omit the article similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names of sudan and both congo brazzaville and congo kinshasa a move in the other direction occurred with the gambia in certain languages such as french and italian definite articles are used with all or most names of countries la france le canada l allemagne l italia la spagna il brasile if a name has a definite article e g the kremlin it cannot idiomatically be used without it we cannot say boris yeltsin is in kremlin r w burchfield 11 some languages also use definite articles with personal names for example such use is standard in portuguese a maria literally the maria in greek and in catalan la n ria el en oriol it also occurs colloquially in spanish german french italian and other languages in hungary it is considered to be a germanism rarely this usage can appear in english a prominent example is how president of the united states and businessman donald trump is known as the donald this wording being used by many publications such as newsweek and new york post this is derived from his ex-wife ivana trump s use of the article with his name a second-language error influenced by the lack of articles in her native czech 12 another is us president ronald reagan s nickname of the gipper 13 publisher townhall com issued an article after reagan s death titled simply goodbye to the gipper 14 partitive article edit a partitive article is a type of article sometimes viewed as a type of indefinite article used with a mass noun such as water to indicate a non-specific quantity of it partitive articles are thus a class of determiner they are used in french and italian in addition to definite and indefinite articles in finnish and estonian the partitive is indicated by inflection the nearest equivalent in english is some although the latter is classified as a determiner but not in all authorities classifications as an indefinite article and english uses it less than french uses de french veux-tu du caf do you want some coffee for more information see the article on the french partitive article haida has a partitive article suffixed -gyaa referring to part of something or to one or more objects of a given group or category e g tluugyaa uu hal tlaahlaang he is making a boat a member of the category of boats 15 negative article edit a negative article specifies none of its noun and can thus be regarded as neither definite nor indefinite on the other hand some consider such a word to be a simple determiner rather than an article in english this function is fulfilled by no which can appear before a singular or plural noun no man has been on this island no dogs are allowed here no one is in the room zero article edit the zero article is the absence of an article in languages having a definite article the lack of an article specifically indicates that the noun is indefinite linguists interested in x-bar theory causally link zero articles to nouns lacking a determiner 16 in english the zero article rather than the indefinite is used with plurals and mass nouns although the word some can be used as an indefinite plural article visitors end up walking in mud variation among languages edit articles in languages in and around europe indefinite and definite articles only definite articles indefinite and suffixed definite articles only suffixed definite articles no articles note that although the saami languages spoken in northern parts of norway and sweden lack articles norwegian and swedish are the majority languages in this area note also that although the irish and scottish gaelic languages lack indefinite articles they too are minority languages in this area with english being the main spoken language articles are found in many indo-european languages semitic languages only the definite article and polynesian languages but are formally absent from many of the world s major languages such as chinese indonesian japanese hindi punjabi urdu russian the majority of slavic and baltic languages yoruba and the bantu languages in some languages that do have articles like for example some north caucasian languages the use of articles is optional but in others like english and german it is mandatory in all cases linguists believe the common ancestor of the indo-european languages proto-indo-european did not have articles most of the languages in this family do not have definite or indefinite articles there is no article in latin or sanskrit nor in some modern indo-european languages such as the families of slavic languages except for bulgarian and macedonian which are rather distinctive among the slavic languages in their grammar and baltic languages although classical greek had a definite article which has survived into modern greek and which bears strong functional resemblance to the german definite article which it is related to the earlier homeric greek used this article largely as a pronoun or demonstrative whereas the earliest known form of greek known as mycenaean greek did not have any articles articles developed independently in several language families not all languages have both definite and indefinite articles and some languages have different types of definite and indefinite articles to distinguish finer shades of meaning for example french and italian have a partitive article used for indefinite mass nouns whereas colognian has two distinct sets of definite articles indicating focus and uniqueness and macedonian uses definite articles in a demonstrative sense with a tripartite distinction proximal medial distal based on distance from the speaker or interlocutor the words this and that and their plurals these and those can be understood in english as ultimately forms of the definite article the whose declension in old english included thaes an ancestral form of this that and these those in many languages the form of the article may vary according to the gender number or case of its noun in some languages the article may be the only indication of the case many languages do not use articles at all and may use other ways of indicating old versus new

italics are constructed languages and are not natural that is to say that they have been purposefully invented by an individual or group of individuals with some purpose in mind they do however all belong to language families themselves esperanto is derived from european languages and therefore all of its roots are found in proto-indo-european and cognates can be found in real-world languages like french german italian and english interlingua is also based on european languages but with its main source being that of italic descendent languages english french spanish italian and portuguese with german and russian being secondary sources with words from further afield but internationally known and often borrowed contributing to the language s vocabulary such as words taken from japanese arabic and finnish the result is a supposedly easy-to-learn language for the world as well as these auxiliary languages the list contains two more quenya and sindarin these two languages were created by professor tolkien and used in his fictional works they are not based on any real-world language family as are esperanto and interlingua but do share a common history with roots in common eldarin tokelauan edit when using a definite article in tokelauan language unlike in some languages like english if the speaker is speaking of an item they need not to have referred to it previously as long as the item is specific 17 this is also true when it comes to the reference of a specific person 17 so although the definite article used to describe a noun in the tokelauan language is te it can also translate to the indefinite article in languages that requires the item being spoken of to have been referenced prior 17 when translating to english te could translate to the english definite article the or it could also translate to the english indefinite article a 17 an example of how the definite article te can be used as an interchangeable definite or indefinite article in the tokelauan language would be the sentence kua hau te tino 17 in the english language this could be translated as a man has arrived or the man has arrived where using te as the article in this sentence can represent any man or a particular man 17 the word he which is the indefinite article in tokelauan is used to describe any such item 17 the word he is used in negative statements because that is where it is most often found alongside its great use in interrogative statements 17 though this is something to make note of he is not used in just in negative statements and questions alone although these two types of statements are where he occurs the most it is also used in other statements as well 17 an example of the use of he as an indefinite article is vili ake oi k aumai he toki where he toki mean an axe 17 the use of he and te in tokelauan are reserved for when describing a singular noun however when describing a plural noun different articles are used for plural definite nouns rather than te the article n is used 17 vili ake oi k aumai n nofoa in tokelauan would translate to do run and bring me the chairs in english 17 there are some special cases in which instead of using n plural definite nouns have no article before them the absence of an article is represented by 0 17 one way that it is usually used is if a large amount or a specific class of things are being described 17 occasionally such as if one was describing an entire class of things in a nonspecific fashion the singular definite noun te would is used 17 in english ko te povi e kai mutia means cows eat grass 17 because this is a general statement about cows te is used instead of n the ko serves as a preposition to the te the article ni is used for describing a plural indefinite noun e i ei ni tuhi translates to are there any books 17 evolution edit articles have developed independently in many different language families across the globe generally articles develop over time usually by specialization of certain adjectives or determiners and their development is often a sign of languages becoming more analytic instead of synthetic perhaps combined with the loss of inflection as in english romance languages bulgarian macedonian and torlakian joseph greenberg in universals of human language 18 describes the cycle of the definite article definite articles stage i evolve from demonstratives and in turn can become generic articles stage ii that may be used in both definite and indefinite contexts and later merely noun markers stage iii that are part of nouns other than proper names and more recent borrowings eventually articles may evolve anew from demonstratives definite articles edit definite articles typically arise from demonstratives meaning that for example the definite articles in the romance languages e g el il le la lo derive from the latin demonstratives ille masculine illa feminine and illud neuter the english definite article the written e in middle english derives from an old english demonstrative which according to gender was written se masculine seo feminine e and eo in the northumbrian dialect or t neuter the neuter form t also gave rise to the modern demonstrative that the ye occasionally seen in pseudo-archaic usage such as ye olde englishe tea shoppe is actually a form of e where the letter thorn came to be written as a y multiple demonstratives can give rise to multiple definite articles macedonian for example in which the articles are suffixed has stolot the chair stolov this chair and stolon that chair these derive from the common slavic demonstratives t this that ov this here and on that over there yonder respectively colognian prepositions articles such as in dat auto or et auto the car the first being specifically selected focused newly introduced while the latter is not selected unfocused already known general or generic standard basque distinguishes between proximal and distal definite articles in the plural dialectally a proximal singular and an additional medial grade may also be present the basque distal form with infix -a- etymologically a suffixed and phonetically reduced form of the distal demonstrative har- hai- functions as the default definite article whereas the proximal form with infix -o- derived from the proximal demonstrative hau- hon- is marked and indicates some kind of spatial or otherwise close relationship between the speaker and the referent e g it may imply that the speaker is included in the referent etxeak the houses vs etxeok these houses of ours euskaldunak the basque speakers vs euskaldunok we the basque speakers indefinite articles edit indefinite articles typically arise from adjectives meaning one for example the indefinite articles in the romance languages e g un una une derive from the latin adjective unus partitive articles however derive from vulgar latin de illo meaning some of the the english indefinite article an is derived from the same root as one the -n came to be dropped before consonants giving rise to the shortened form a the existence of both forms has led to many cases of juncture loss for example transforming the original a napron into the modern an apron the persian indefinite article is yek meaning one see also edit english articles al- definite article in arabic definiteness definite description false title references

hispanic contact linguistics in the americas madrid frankfurt iberoamericana-vervuert a b new oxford dictionary of english 1999 usage note for an there is still some divergence of opinion over the form of the indefinite article to use preceding certain words beginning with h- when the first syllable is unstressed a historical document or an historical document a hotel or an hotel the form depends on whether the initial h is sounded or not an was common in the 18th and 19th centuries because the initial h was commonly not pronounced for these words in standard modern english the norm is for the h to be pronounced in words like hotel and historical and therefore the indefinite article a is used however the older form with the silent h and the indefinite article an is still encountered
