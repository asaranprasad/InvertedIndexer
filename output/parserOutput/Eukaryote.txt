animalia animals kingdom fungi eukaryotic organisms that cannot be classified under the kingdoms plantae animalia or fungi are sometimes grouped in the kingdom protista a eukaryote ju k ri o t or ju k ri t is any organism whose cells have a cell nucleus and other organelles enclosed within membranes eukaryotes belong to the domain eukaryota or eukarya and can be unicellular or multicellular organisms the defining feature that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells bacteria and archaea is that they have membrane-bound organelles especially the nucleus which contains the genetic material enclosed by the nuclear membrane 3 4 5 the presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name which comes from the greek eu well or true and karyon nut or kernel 6 eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the golgi apparatus in addition plants and algae contain chloroplasts unlike unicellular archaea and bacteria eukaryotes may also be multicellular and include organisms consisting of many kinds of tissue and cell types eukaryotes can reproduce both asexually through mitosis and sexually through meiosis and gamete fusion in mitosis one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells in meiosis dna replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four haploid daughter cells these act as sex cells gametes each gamete has just one set of chromosomes each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental chromosomes resulting from genetic recombination during meiosis the domain eukaryota appears to be monophyletic and makes up one of the domains of life in the three-domain system the two other domains bacteria and archaea are prokaryotes 7 and have none of the above features eukaryotes represent a tiny minority of all living things 8 however due to their generally much larger size their collective worldwide biomass is estimated to be about equal to that of prokaryotes 8 eukaryotes

references 9 external links history edit konstantin mereschkowski proposed a symbiotic origin for cells with nuclei in 1905 and 1910 the russian biologist konstantin mereschkowski 1855 1921 argued three things about the origin of nucleated cells firstly plastids were reduced cyanobacteria in a symbiosis with a non-photosynthetic heterotrophic host secondly the host had earlier in evolution formed by symbiosis between an amoeba-like host and a bacteria-like micrococcal cell that formed the nucleus thirdly plants inherited photosynthesis from cyanobacteria 9 the concept of the eukaryote has been attributed to the french biologist edouard chatton 1883-1947 the terms prokaryote and eukaryote were more definitively reintroduced by the canadian microbiologist roger stanier and the dutch-american microbiologist c b van niel in 1962 in his 1938 work titres et travaux scientifiques chatton had proposed the two terms calling the bacteria prokaryotes and organisms with nuclei in their cells eukaryotes however he mentioned this in only one paragraph and the idea was effectively ignored until chatton s statement was rediscovered by stanier and van niel 10 in 1967 lynn margulis provided microbiological evidence for endosymbiosis as the origin of chloroplasts and mitochondria in eukaryotic cells in her paper on the origin of mitosing cells 11 in the 1970s carl woese explored microbial phylogenetics studying variations in 16s ribosomal rna this helped to uncover the origin of the eukaryotes and the symbiogenesis of two important eukaryote organelles mitochondria and chloroplasts in 1977 woese and george fox introduced a third form of life which they called the archaebacteria in 1990 woese otto kandler and mark l wheeler renamed this the archaea 10 in 1979 g w gould and g j dring suggested that the eukaryotic cell s nucleus came from the ability of gram-positive bacteria to form endospores in 1987 and later papers thomas cavalier-smith proposed instead that the membranes of the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum first formed by infolding a prokaryote s plasma membrane in the 1990s several other biologists proposed endosymbiotic origins for the nucleus effectively reviving mereschkowsky s theory 9 cell features edit eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than those of prokaryotes having a volume of around 10,000 times greater than the prokaryotic cell 12 they have a variety of internal membrane-bound structures called organelles and a cytoskeleton composed of microtubules microfilaments and intermediate filaments which play an important role in defining the cell s organization and shape eukaryotic dna is divided into several linear bundles called chromosomes which are separated by a microtubular spindle during nuclear division internal membrane edit the endomembrane system and its components eukaryote cells include a variety of membrane-bound structures collectively referred to as the endomembrane system 13 simple compartments called vesicles and vacuoles can form by budding off other membranes many cells ingest food and other materials through a process of endocytosis where the outer membrane invaginates and then pinches off to form a vesicle 14 it is probable that most other membrane-bound organelles are ultimately derived from such vesicles alternatively some products produced by the cell can leave in a vesicle through exocytosis the nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane commonly referred to as a nuclear membrane or nuclear envelope with pores that allow material to move in and out 15 various tube- and sheet-like extensions of the nuclear membrane form the endoplasmic reticulum which is involved in protein transport and maturation it includes the rough endoplasmic reticulum where ribosomes are attached to synthesize proteins which enter the interior space or lumen subsequently they generally enter vesicles which bud off from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum 16 in most eukaryotes these protein-carrying vesicles are released and further modified in stacks of flattened vesicles cisternae the golgi apparatus 17 vesicles may be specialized for various purposes for instance lysosomes contain digestive enzymes that break down most biomolecules in the cytoplasm 18 peroxisomes are used to break down peroxide which is otherwise toxic many protozoans have contractile vacuoles which collect and expel excess water and extrusomes which expel material used to deflect predators or capture prey in higher plants most of a cell s volume is taken up by a central vacuole which mostly contains water and primarily maintains its osmotic pressure mitochondria and plastids edit simplified structure of a mitochondrion mitochondria are organelles found in nearly all eukaryotes that provide energy to the cell by converting ingested sugars into atp 19 they have two surrounding membranes each a phospholipid bi-layer the inner of which is folded into invaginations called cristae where aerobic respiration takes place mitochondria contain their own dna they are now generally held to have developed from endosymbiotic prokaryotes probably proteobacteria protozoa and microbes that lack mitochondria such as the amoebozoan pelomyxa and metamonads such as giardia and trichomonas have usually been found to contain mitochondrion-derived organelles such as hydrogenosomes and mitosomes and thus probably lost the mitochondria secondarily they obtain energy by enzymatic action on nutrients absorbed from the environment the metamonad monocercomonoides has also acquired by lateral gene transfer a cytosolic sulphur mobilisation system which provides the clusters of iron and sulfur required for protein synthesis the normal mitochondrial iron-sulphur cluster pathway has been lost secondarily 20 21 plants and various groups of algae also have plastids plastids have their own dna and are developed from endosymbionts in this case cyanobacteria they usually take the form of chloroplasts which like cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll and produce organic compounds such as glucose through photosynthesis others are involved in storing food although plastids probably had a single origin not all plastid-containing groups are closely related instead some eukaryotes have obtained them from others through secondary endosymbiosis or ingestion 22 endosymbiotic origins have also been proposed for the nucleus and for eukaryotic flagella 23 cytoskeletal structures edit longitudinal section through the flagellum of chlamydomonas reinhardtii many eukaryotes have long slender motile cytoplasmic projections called flagella or similar structures called cilia flagella and cilia are sometimes referred to as undulipodia 24 and are variously involved in movement feeding and sensation they are composed mainly of tubulin these are entirely distinct from prokaryotic flagellae they are supported by a bundle of microtubules arising from a centriole characteristically arranged as nine doublets surrounding two singlets flagella also may have hairs or mastigonemes and scales connecting membranes and internal rods their interior is continuous with the cell s cytoplasm microfilamental structures composed of actin and actin binding proteins e g -actinin fimbrin filamin are present in submembraneous cortical layers and bundles as well motor proteins of microtubules e g dynein or kinesin and actin e g myosins provide dynamic character of the network centrioles are often present even in cells and groups that do not have flagella but conifers and flowering plants have neither they generally occur in groups that give rise to various microtubular roots these form a primary component of the cytoskeletal structure and are often assembled over the course of several cell divisions with one flagellum retained from the parent and the other derived from it centrioles produce the spindle during nuclear division 25 the significance of cytoskeletal structures is underlined in the determination of shape of the cells as well as their being essential components of migratory responses like chemotaxis and chemokinesis some protists have various other microtubule-supported organelles these include the radiolaria and heliozoa which produce axopodia used in flotation or to capture prey and the haptophytes which have a peculiar flagellum-like organelle called the haptonema cell wall edit the cells of plants fungi and most chromalveolates have a cell wall a layer outside the cell membrane providing the cell with structural support protection and a filtering mechanism the cell wall also prevents over-expansion when water enters the cell 26 the major polysaccharides making up the primary cell wall of land plants are cellulose hemicellulose and pectin the cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers to form the cellulose-hemicellulose network which is embedded in the pectin matrix the most common hemicellulose in the primary cell wall is xyloglucan 27 differences among eukaryotic cells edit there are many different types of eukaryotic cells though animals and plants are the most familiar eukaryotes and thus provide an excellent starting point for understanding eukaryotic structure fungi and many protists have some substantial differences however animal cell edit structure of a typical animal cell play media 3d simulation of animal cell structure of a typical plant cell all animals are eukaryotic animal cells are distinct from those of other eukaryotes most notably plants as they lack cell walls and chloroplasts and have smaller vacuoles due to the lack of a cell wall animal cells can adopt a variety of shapes a phagocytic cell can even engulf other structures there are many other types of cell for instance there are approximately 210 distinct cell types in the adult human body plant cell edit plant cells are quite different from the cells of the other eukaryotic organisms their distinctive features are a large central vacuole enclosed by a membrane the tonoplast which maintains the cell s turgor and controls movement of molecules between the cytosol and sap 28 a primary cell wall containing cellulose hemicellulose and pectin deposited by the protoplast on the outside of the cell membrane this contrasts with the cell walls of fungi which contain chitin and the cell envelopes of prokaryotes in which peptidoglycans are the main structural molecules the plasmodesmata linking pores in the cell wall that allow each plant cell to communicate with other adjacent cells 29 this is different from the functionally analogous system of gap junctions between animal cells plastids especially chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll the pigment that gives plants their green color and allows them to perform photosynthesis bryophytes and seedless vascular plants lack flagellae and centrioles except in the sperm cells 30 sperm of cycads and ginkgo are large complex cells that swim with hundreds to thousands of flagellae 31 conifers pinophyta and flowering plants angiospermae lack the flagellae and centrioles that are present in animal cells fungal cell

12- golgi apparatus the cells of fungi are most similar to animal cells with the following exceptions 32 a cell wall that contains chitin less definition between cells the hyphae of higher fungi have porous partitions called septa which allow the passage of cytoplasm organelles and sometimes nuclei primitive fungi have few or no septa so each organism is essentially a giant multinucleate supercell these fungi are described as coenocytic only the most primitive fungi chytrids have flagella other eukaryotic cells edit eukaryotes are a very diverse group and their cell structures are equally diverse many have cell walls many do not many have chloroplasts derived from primary secondary or even tertiary endosymbiosis and many do not some groups have unique structures such as the cyanelles unusual chloroplasts of the glaucophytes 33 the haptonema of the haptophytes or the ejectosomes of the cryptomonads other structures such as pseudopodia are found in various eukaryote groups in different forms such as the lobose amoebozoans or the reticulose foraminiferans 34 reproduction edit this diagram illustrates the twofold cost of sex if each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring two a the sexual population remains the same size each generation where the b asexual population doubles in size each generation cell division generally takes place asexually by mitosis a process that allows each daughter nucleus to receive one copy of each chromosome in most eukaryotes there is also a process of sexual reproduction typically involving an alternation between haploid generations wherein only one copy of each chromosome is present and diploid generations wherein two copies of each chromosome are present occurring through meiosis there is considerable variation in this pattern eukaryotes have a smaller surface area to volume ratio than prokaryotes and thus have lower metabolic rates and longer generation times 35 in some multicellular organisms cells specialized for metabolism have enlarged surface areas such as intestinal villi the evolution of sexual reproduction may be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes based on a phylogenetic analysis dacks and roger proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes 36 a core set of genes that function in meiosis is present in both trichomonas vaginalis and giardia intestinalis two organisms previously thought to be asexual 37 38 since these two species are descendants of lineages that diverged early from the eukaryotic evolutionary tree it was inferred that core meiotic genes and hence sex were likely present in a common ancestor of all eukaryotes 37 38 eukaryotic species once thought to be asexual such as parasitic protozoa of the genus leishmania have been shown to have a sexual cycle 39 also evidence now indicates that amoebae previously regarded as asexual are anciently sexual and that the majority of present-day asexual groups likely arose recently and independently 40 classification edit phylogenetic and symbiogenetic tree of living organisms showing a view of the origins of eukaryotes prokaryotes one hypothesis of eukaryotic relationships the opisthokonta group includes both animals metazoa and fungi plants plantae are placed in archaeplastida a pie chart of described eukaryote species except for excavata together with a tree showing possible relationships between the groups in antiquity the two lineages of animals and plants were recognized they were given the taxonomic rank of kingdom by linnaeus though he included the fungi with plants with some reservations it was later realized that they are quite distinct and warrant a separate kingdom the composition of which was not entirely clear until the 1980s 41 the various single-cell eukaryotes were originally placed with plants or animals when they became known in 1830 the german biologist georg a goldfuss coined the word protozoa to refer to organisms such as ciliates and this group was expanded until it encompassed all single-celled eukaryotes and given their own kingdom the protista by ernst haeckel in 1866 42 43 the eukaryotes thus came to be composed of four kingdoms kingdom protista kingdom plantae kingdom fungi kingdom animalia the protists were understood to be primitive forms and thus an evolutionary grade united by their primitive unicellular nature 43 the disentanglement of the deep splits in the tree of life only really started with dna sequencing leading to a system of domains rather than kingdoms as top level rank being put forward by carl woese uniting all the eukaryote kingdoms under the eukaryote domain 44 at the same time work on the protist tree intensified and is still actively going on today several alternative classifications have been forwarded though there is no consensus in the field a classification produced in 2005 for the international society of protistologists 45 which reflected the consensus of the time divided the eukaryotes into six supposedly monophyletic supergroups however in the same year 2005 doubts were expressed as to whether some of these supergroups were monophyletic particularly the chromalveolata 46 and a review in 2006 noted the lack of evidence for several of the supposed six supergroups 47 a revised classification in 2012 2 recognizes five supergroups archaeplastida or primoplantae land plants green algae red algae and glaucophytes sar supergroup stramenopiles brown algae diatoms etc alveolata and rhizaria foraminifera radiolaria and various other amoeboid protozoa excavata various flagellate protozoa amoebozoa most lobose amoeboids and slime molds opisthokonta animals fungi choanoflagellates etc there are also smaller groups of eukaryotes whose position is uncertain or seems to fall outside the major groups 48 in particular haptophyta cryptophyta centrohelida telonemia picozoa 49 apusomonadida ancyromonadida breviatea and the genus collodictyon 50 overall it seems that although progress has been made there are still very significant uncertainties in the evolutionary history and classification of eukaryotes as roger simpson said in 2009 with the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life we should proceed with caution 51 in an article published in nature microbiology in april 2016 the authors reinforced once again that the life we see around us plants animals humans and other so-called eukaryotes represent a tiny percentage of the world s biodiversity 52 they classified eukaryote based on the inheritance of their information systems as opposed to lipid or other cellular structures jillian f banfield of the university of california berkeley and fellow scientists used a super computer to generate a diagram of a new tree of life based on dna from 3000 species including 2,072 known species and 1,011 newly reported microbial organisms whose dna they had gathered from diverse environments 7 53 as the capacity to sequence dna became easier banfield and team were able to do metagenomic sequencing sequencing whole communities of organisms at once and picking out the individual groups based on their genes alone 52 phylogeny edit the rrna trees constructed during the 1980s and 1990s left most eukaryotes in an unresolved crown group not technically a true crown which was usually divided by the form of the mitochondrial cristae see crown eukaryotes the few groups that lack mitochondria branched separately and so the absence was believed to be primitive but this is now considered an artifact of long-branch attraction and they are known to have lost them secondarily 54 55 as of 2011 there is widespread agreement that the rhizaria belong with the stramenopiles and the alveolata in a clade dubbed the sar supergroup so that rhizaria is not one of the main eukaryote groups also that the amoebozoa and opisthokonta are each monophyletic and form a clade often called the unikonts 56 57 58 59 60 beyond this there does not appear to be a consensus it has been estimated that there may be 75 distinct lineages of eukaryotes 61 most of these lineages are protists the known eukaryote genome sizes vary from 8.2 megabases mb in babesia bovis to 112,000 220,050 mb in the dinoflagellate prorocentrum micans showing that the genome of the ancestral eukaryote has undergone considerable variation during its evolution 61 the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes is believed to have been a phagotrophic protist with a nucleus at least one centriole and cilium facultatively aerobic mitochondria sex meiosis and syngamy a dormant cyst with a cell wall of chitin and or cellulose and peroxisomes 61 later endosymbiosis led to the spread of plastids in some lineages five supergroups edit a global tree of eukaryotes from a consensus of phylogenetic evidence in particular phylogenomics rare genomic signatures and morphological characteristics is presented in adl et al 2012 2 and burki 2014 2016 with the cryptophyta and picozoa having emerged within the archaeplastida 48 62 a similar inclusion of glaucophyta cryptista and also haptista telonemia is recovered in karnkowska et al with rhodophyta telonemia as basal archaeplastida 63 eukaryotes diaphoretickes archaeplastida red algae rhodophyta picozoa glaucophyta green plants viridiplantae cryptista haptista telonemia sar halvaria stramenopiles alveolata rhizaria discoba amorphea amoebozoa apusomonadida opisthokonta holomycota inc fungi holozoa inc animals hacrobia in some analyses the hacrobia group haptophyta cryptophyta is placed next to archaeplastida 56 but in other ones it is nested inside the archaeplastida 64 however several recent studies have concluded that haptophyta and cryptophyta do not form a monophyletic group 65 the former could be a sister group to the sar group the latter cluster with the archaeplastida plants in the broad sense 66 the division of the eukaryotes into two primary clades bikonts archaeplastida sar excavata and unikonts amoebozoa opisthokonta derived from an ancestral biflagellar organism and an ancestral uniflagellar organism respectively had been suggested earlier 64 67 68 a 2012 study produced a somewhat similar division although noting that the terms unikonts and bikonts were not used in the original sense 49 a highly converged and congruent set of trees appears in derelle et al 2015 ren et al 2016 yang et al 2017 and cavalier-smith 2015 including the supplementary information resulting in a more conservative and consolidated tree it is combined with some results from cavalier-smith for the basal opimoda 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 the main remaining controversies are the root and the exact positioning of the rhodophyta and the bikonts rhizaria haptista cryptista picozoa and telonemia many of which may be eukaryote-eukaryote hybrids 77 archeaplastida developed the chloroplasts probably by endosymbiosis of an ancestor related to a

showing a possible relationship between the eukaryotes and other forms of life 85 eukaryotes are colored red archaea green and bacteria blue fossils edit the origin of the eukaryotic cell is a milestone in the evolution of life since eukaryotes include all complex cells and almost all multicellular organisms the timing of this series of events is hard to determine knoll 2006 suggests they developed approximately 1.6 2.1 billion years ago some acritarchs are known from at least 1.65 billion years ago and the possible alga grypania has been found as far back as 2.1 billion years ago 86 the geosiphon-like fossil fungus diskagma has been found in paleosols 2.2 billion years old 87 organized living structures have been found in the black shales of the palaeoproterozoic francevillian b formation in gabon dated at 2.1 billion years old eukaryotic life could have evolved at that time 88 fossils that are clearly related to modern groups start appearing an estimated 1.2 billion years ago in the form of a red alga though recent work suggests the existence of fossilized filamentous algae in the vindhya basin dating back perhaps to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago 89 biomarkers suggest that at least stem eukaryotes arose even earlier the presence of steranes in australian shales indicates that eukaryotes were present in these rocks dated at 2.7 billion years old 90 91 relationship to archaea edit the nuclear dna and genetic machinery of eukaryotes is more similar to archaea than bacteria leading to a controversial suggestion that eukaryotes should be grouped with archaea in the clade neomura in other respects such as membrane composition eukaryotes are similar to bacteria three main explanations for this have been proposed eukaryotes resulted from the complete fusion of two or more cells wherein the cytoplasm formed from a eubacterium and the nucleus from an archaeon 92 from a virus 93 94 or from a pre-cell 95 96 eukaryotes developed from archaea and acquired their eubacterial characteristics through the endosymbiosis of a proto-mitochondrion of eubacterial origin 97 eukaryotes and archaea developed separately from a modified eubacterium diagram of the origin of life with the eukaryotes appearing early not derived from prokaryotes as proposed by richard egel in 2012 this view implies that the uca was relatively large and complex 98 alternative proposals include the chronocyte hypothesis postulates that a primitive eukaryotic cell was formed by the endosymbiosis of both archaea and bacteria by a third type of cell termed a chronocyte 99 the universal common ancestor uca of the current tree of life was a complex organism that survived a mass extinction event rather than an early stage in the evolution of life eukaryotes and in particular akaryotes bacteria and archaea evolved through reductive loss 100 so that similarities result from differential retention of original features assuming no other group is involved there are three possible phylogenies for the bacteria archaea and eukaryota in which each is monophyletic these are labelled 1 to 3 in the table below the eocyte hypothesis is a modification of hypothesis 2 in which the archaea are paraphyletic the table and the names for the hypotheses are based on harish and kurland 2017 101 alternative hypotheses for the base of the tree of life 1 two empires 2 three domains 3 gupta 4 eocyte uca archaea bacteria eukaryota uca eukaryota archaea bacteria uca eukaryota bacteria archaea uca eukaryota archaea-crenarchaeota archaea-euryarchaeota bacteria in recent years most researchers have favoured either the three domains 3d or the eocyte hypotheses an rrna analyses supports the eocyte scenario apparently with the eukaryote root in excavata 102 80 81 82 83 a cladogram supporting the eocyte hypothesis positioning eukaryotes within archaea based on phylogenomic analyses of the asgard archaea is 103 104 proteoarchaeota tack korarchaeota crenarchaeota aigarchaeota geoarchaeota thaumarchaeota bathyarchaeota asgard lokiarchaeota odinarchaeota thorarchaeota heimdallarchaeota proteobacteria eukaryota in this scenario the asgard group is seen as a sister taxon of the tack group which comprises crenarchaeota formerly named eocytes thaumarchaeota and others in 2017 there has been significant pushback against this scenario arguing that the eukaryotes did not emerge within the archaea cunha et al produced analyses supporting the three domains 3d or woese hypothesis 2 in the table above and rejecting the eocyte hypothesis 4 above 105 harish and kurland found strong support for the earlier two empires 2d or mayr hypothesis 1 in the table above based on analyses of the coding sequences of protein domains they rejected the eocyte hypothesis as the least likely 106 101 a possible interpretation of their analysis is that the universal common ancestor uca of the current tree of life was a complex organism that survived an evolutionary bottleneck rather than a simpler organism arising early in the history of life 100 endomembrane system and mitochondria edit the origins of the endomembrane system and mitochondria are also unclear 107 the phagotrophic hypothesis proposes that eukaryotic-type membranes lacking a cell wall originated first with the development of endocytosis whereas mitochondria were acquired by ingestion as endosymbionts 108 the syntrophic hypothesis proposes that the proto-eukaryote relied on the proto-mitochondrion for food and so ultimately grew to surround it here the membranes originated after the engulfment of the mitochondrion in part thanks to mitochondrial genes the hydrogen hypothesis is one particular version 109 in a study using genomes to construct supertrees pisani et al 2007 suggest that along with evidence that there was never a mitochondrion-less eukaryote eukaryotes evolved from a syntrophy between an archaea closely related to thermoplasmatales and an -proteobacterium likely a symbiosis driven by sulfur or hydrogen the mitochondrion and its genome is a remnant of the -proteobacterial endosymbiont 110 hypotheses edit different hypotheses have been proposed as to how eukaryotic cells came into existence these hypotheses can be classified into two distinct classes autogenous models and chimeric models autogenous models edit an autogenous model for the origin of eukaryotes autogenous models propose that a proto-eukaryotic cell containing a nucleus existed first and later acquired mitochondria 111 according to this model a large prokaryote developed invaginations in its plasma membrane in order to obtain enough surface area to service its cytoplasmic volume as the invaginations differentiated in function some became separate compartments giving rise to the endomembrane system including the endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus nuclear membrane and single membrane structures such as lysosomes 112 mitochondria are proposed to come from the endosymbiosis of an aerobic proteobacterium and it s assumed that all the eukaryotic lineages that did not acquire mitochondria became extinct 113 chloroplasts came about from another endosymbiotic event involving cyanobacteria since all eukaryotes have mitochondria but not all have chloroplasts the serial endosymbiosis theory proposes that mitochondria came first chimeric models edit chimeric models claim that two prokaryotic cells existed initially an archaeon and a bacterium these cells underwent a merging process either by a physical fusion or by endosymbiosis thereby leading to the formation of a eukaryotic cell within these chimeric models some studies further claim that mitochondria originated from a bacterial ancestor while others emphasize the role of endosymbiotic processes behind the origin of mitochondria based on the process of mutualistic symbiosis the hypotheses can be categorized as the serial endosymbiotic theory set 114 115 116 the hydrogen hypothesis mostly a process of symbiosis where hydrogen transfer takes place among different species 117 and the syntrophy hypothesis 118 119 according to serial endosymbiotic theory championed by lynn margulis a union between a motile anaerobic bacterium like spirochaeta and a thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon like thermoplasma which is sulfidogenic in nature gave rise to the present day eukaryotes this union established a motile organism capable of living in the already existing acidic and sulfurous waters oxygen is known to cause toxicity to organisms that lack the required metabolic machinery thus the archaeon provided the bacterium with a highly beneficial reduced environment sulfur and sulfate were reduced to sulfide in microaerophilic conditions oxygen was reduced to water thereby creating a mutual benefit platform the bacterium on the other hand contributed the necessary fermentation products and electron acceptors along with its motility feature to the archaeon thereby gaining a swimming motility for the organism from a consortium of bacterial and archaeal dna originated the nuclear genome of eukaryotic cells spirochetes gave rise to the motile features of eukaryotic cells endosymbiotic unifications of the ancestors of alpha-proteobacteria and cyanobacteria led to the origin of mitochondria and plastids respectively for example thiodendron has been known to have originated via an ectosymbiotic process based on a similar syntrophy of sulfur existing between the two types of bacteria desulphobacter and spirochaeta however such an association based on motile symbiosis have never been observed practically also there is no evidence of archaeans and spirochetes adapting to intense acid-based environments 120 in the hydrogen hypothesis the symbiotic linkage of an anaerobic and autotrophic methanogenic archaeon host with an alpha-proteobacterium the symbiont gave rise to the eukaryotes the host utilized hydrogen h2 and carbon dioxide co2 to produce methane while the symbiont capable of aerobic respiration expelled h2 and co2 as byproducts of anaerobic fermentation process the host s methanogenic environment worked as a sink for h2 which resulted in heightened bacterial fermentation endosymbiotic gene transfer egt acted as a catalyst for the host to acquire the symbionts carbohydrate metabolism and turn heterotrophic in nature subsequently the host s methane forming capability was lost thus the origins of the heterotrophic organelle symbiont are identical to the origins of the eukaryotic lineage in this hypothesis the presence of h2 represents the selective force that forged eukaryotes out of prokaryotes citation needed the syntrophy hypothesis was developed in contrast to the hydrogen hypothesis and proposes the existence of two symbiotic events according to this theory the origin of eukaryotic cells was based on metabolic symbiosis syntrophy between a methanogenic archaeon and a delta-proteobacterium this syntrophic symbiosis was initially facilitated by h2 transfer between different species under anaerobic environments in earlier stages an alpha-proteobacterium became a member of this integration and later developed into the mitochondrion gene transfer from a delta-proteobacterium to an archaeon led to the methanogenic archaeon developing into a nucleus the archaeon constituted the genetic apparatus while the delta-proteobacterium contributed towards the cytoplasmic features this theory incorporates two selective forces at the time of nucleus evolution a presence of metabolic partitioning to avoid the harmful effects of the co-existence of anabolic and catabolic cellular pathways and b prevention of abnormal protein biosynthesis due to a vast spread of introns in the archaeal genes after acquiring the mitochondrion and losing methanogenesis citation needed see also edit book eukaryote evolution of sexual reproduction list of sequenced eukaryotic genomes parikaryote prokaryote
