state union of serbia and montenegro 1 dr avna zajednica srbija i crna gora was a country in southeast europe created from the two remaining federal republics of yugoslavia after its breakup in 1992 the republics of serbia and montenegro together established a federation in 1992 as the federal republic of yugoslavia fr yugoslavia or fry savezna republika jugoslavija 2 a name which the union held until february 2003 the state aspired to be recognized as the sole legal successor to yugoslavia but those claims were opposed by other former constituent republics the united nations also denied its request to take up yugoslavia s membership 3 eventually after the overthrow of slobodan milo evi from power as president of the federation in 2000 the country rescinded those aspirations and accepted the opinion of the badinter arbitration committee about shared succession it re-applied for un membership on 27 october and was admitted on 1 november 2000 4 the fry was initially dominated by slobodan milo evi as president of serbia 1989 1997 and then president of yugoslavia 1997 2000 5 milo evi installed and forced the removal of several federal presidents such as dobrica osi and prime ministers such as milan pani 5 however the montenegrin government initially enthusiastic supporters of milo evi started gradually distancing themselves from his policies that culminated in regime change in 1996 when his former ally milo ukanovi reversed his policies became leader of montenegro s ruling party and subsequently dismissed former montenegrin leader momir bulatovi who remained loyal to the milo evi government as bulatovi was given central positions in belgrade from that time as federal prime minister ukanovi continued to govern montenegro and further isolated it from serbia so that from 1996 to 2006 montenegro and serbia were only nominally one country governance at every feasible level was conducted locally belgrade for serbia and podgorica for montenegro a loose union serbia and montenegro were united only in certain realms such as defense the two constituent republics functioned separately throughout the period of the federal republic and continued to operate under separate economic policies as well as using separate currencies the euro was the only legal tender in montenegro on 21 may 2006 the montenegrin independence referendum was held and 55.5 of voters voted in favor of independence the state union came to an end after montenegro s formal declaration of independence on 3 june 2006 and serbia s formal declaration of independence on 5 june

only the republics of serbia and montenegro agreed to maintain the yugoslav state and established a new constitution for a new yugoslavia in 1992 with the collapse of communism across eastern europe the new state followed the wave of democratic change it abandoned communist symbolism the red star was removed from the national flag and the communist coat of arms was replaced by a white double-headed eagle with the arms of both serbia and montenegro within it the new state also established the office of the president held by a single person initially appointed with the consent of the republics of serbia and montenegro until 1997 after which the president was democratically elected foundation edit with the collapse of yugoslavia and its institutions from 1991 to 1992 the issue of unity of the two republics remaining in the collapsing federation serbia montenegro as well as serb-majority territories in croatia and bosnia that wished to remain united became an issue in 1991 diplomatic talks chaired by lord carrington with the leaders of the six republics of the collapsing federation resulted in all the republics except for serbia agreeing that yugoslavia had collapsed and that each republic should become an independent state the serbian government was surprised and outraged by montenegro s decision in favour of terminating yugoslavia as the bulatovic government had previously been closely allied with milosevic s government in serbia citation needed yugoslavia s collapse began in 1991 when slovenia croatia and the republic of macedonia declared independence on 26 december 1991 serbia montenegro and the serb rebel-held territories in croatia agreed that they would form a new third yugoslavia 6 efforts were also made in 1991 to include sr bosnia and herzegovina within the federation with negotiations between milo evic bosnia s serbian democratic party and the bosniak proponent of union bosnia s vice-president adil zulfikarpa i taking place on this matter 7 zulfikarpa i believed that bosnia could benefit from a union with serbia montenegro and krajina thus he supported a union which would secure the unity of serbs and bosniaks 7 milo evic continued negotiations with zulfikarpa i to include bosnia within a new yugoslavia however efforts to include the whole of bosnia within a new yugoslavia effectively terminated by late 1991 as izetbegovi planned to hold a referendum on independence while the bosnian serbs and bosnian croats formed autonomous territories 7 yugoslav wars edit serb-controlled territories during the yugoslav wars the fry was suspended from a number of international institutions this was due to the ongoing yugoslav wars during the 1990s which had prevented agreement being reached on the disposition of federal assets and liabilities particularly the national debt the government of yugoslavia supported croatian and bosnian serbs in the wars from 1992 to 1995 because of that the country was under economic and political sanctions which resulted in economic disaster that forced thousands of its young citizens to emigrate from the country in a bbc documentary called the death of yugoslavia and later in his testimony before the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia during the trial of slobodan milo evi yugoslav official borisav jovi revealed that the bosnian serb army arose from the yugoslav army forces in bosnia and herzegovina he claimed that he had realized that bosnia and herzegovina was about to be recognized by the international community and since yugoslav people s army troops were still located there at that point their presence on bosnian territory could have led to the federal republic of yugoslavia being accused of aggression to avoid this he and milo evi decided to move all jna soldiers originating from serbia and montenegro back into serbia and montenegro and to move all jna soldiers of bosnian serb descent to bosnia and herzegovina 8 in this way every bosnian serb was transferred from the yugoslav army to what became the newly created bosnian serb army through this the bosnian serb army also received extensive military equipment and full funding from the fry as the bosnian serb faction alone could not pay for the costs 8 furthermore serbian radical party founder and paramilitary vojislav e elj claimed that president milo evi personally asked him to send paramilitaries into bosnia and herzegovina 8 in 1995 serbian president slobodan milo evi represented the fry and bosnian serbs at peace talks in dayton ohio us which negotiated the end of war in bosnia with the dayton agreement growing separatism edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be

and the serbian leadership began to appear by 1998 simultaneously with montenegrin prime minister milo ukanovi coming out on top in the power struggle with montenegrin president momir bulatovi the republic undertook a different economic policy by adopting the deutsche mark as its currency during autumn 1999 following the kosovo war and the nato bombing campaign ukanovi who by now firmly held power in montenegro as bulatovi was completely squeezed out drafted a document called platforma za redefiniciju odnosa crne gore i srbije a platform for redefinition of relations within the federal republic of yugoslavia calling for major changes in the division of governing responsibilities within fr yugoslavia though still officially seeing montenegro within a joint state with serbia milo evi did not respond to the platform considering it unconstitutional political relations within the federal state became more and more strained especially against the backdrop of the wave of assassinations against top figures from political criminal and state business circles in both republics eljko arkan ra natovi pavle bulatovi ika petrovi and goran ugi as well as two attempts on the life of opposition politician vuk dra kovi by october 2000 milo evi had lost power in serbia contrary to expectation ukanovi s response to the power change in belgrade was not to further push the agenda outlined in his platform but instead to suddenly start pushing for full independence thus completely dropping the platform in the process subsequent governments of montenegro carried out pro-independence policies and political tensions with serbia simmered despite political changes in belgrade kosovo war edit the za to why monument dedicated to the employees of the radio television of serbia rts who were killed during nato bombing of the rts building in 1999 with milo evi s second and last legal term as serbian president expiring in 1997 he ran for and was elected president of yugoslavia in 1997 upon taking office milo evi gained direct control of the yugoslav military and security forces and directed them to engage kosovo separatists the conflict escalated from 1998 to 1999 and became known as the kosovo war yugoslav forces committed a series of atrocities in kosovo to prevent ethnic cleansing the north atlantic treaty organization nato under the leadership of the united states began an air campaign called operation allied force against yugoslav military forces and positions and suspected serbian paramilitaries 9 the air attacks against belgrade by nato were the first attacks on the city since world war ii some of the worst massacres against civilian albanians by serbian forces occurred after nato started its bombing of yugoslavia the serbian police and paramilitaries also committed massacres during the war including the cuska massacre 10 and the podujevo massacre 11 12 nato promised to end its bombings of yugoslavia when milo evi agreed to withdraw all yugoslav and serb security forces from kosovo after an array of bombings milo evi submitted and recalled all forces and nato peacekeepers entered kosovo 13 state union edit in 2002 serbia and montenegro came to a new agreement regarding continued co-operation which among other changes promised the end of the name yugoslavia since they were part of the federal republic of yugoslavia on 4 february 2003 the federal assembly of yugoslavia created a loose state union the state union of serbia and montenegro a new constitutional charter was agreed to provide a framework for the governance of the country on sunday 21 may 2006 montenegrins voted in an independence referendum with 55.5 supporting independence fifty-five percent or more of affirmative votes were needed to dissolve the state union of serbia and montenegro the turnout was 86.3 and 99.73 of the more than 477,000 votes cast were deemed valid the subsequent montenegrin proclamation of independence on june 2006 and the serbian proclamation of independence on 5 june ended the state union of serbia and montenegro and thus the last remaining vestiges of the former yugoslavia politics edit the federal assembly of fry 1992 2003 was composed of two chambers the council of citizens and the council of republics whereas the council of citizens served as an ordinary assembly representing the people of fry the council of republics was made equally by representatives from the federation s constituent republics to ensure federal equality the status of leadership of the fry president was unstable with no president lasting more than four years in office the first president from 1992 to 1993 was dobrica osi a former communist yugoslav partisan during world war ii and later one of the fringe contributors of the controversial memorandum of the serbian academy of sciences and arts despite being head of the country osi was forced out of office in 1993 due to his opposition to serbian president slobodan milo evi osi was replaced by zoran lili who served from 1993 to 1997 and then followed by milo evi becoming yugoslav president in 1997 after his last legal term as serbian president ended in 1997 the presidential election in 2000 was accused of being the result of vote fraud yugoslav citizens took to the streets and engaged in riots in belgrade demanding that milo evi be removed from power shortly afterwards milo evi resigned and vojislav ko tunica took over as yugoslav president and remained president until the state s reconstitution as the state union of serbia and montenegro federal prime minister milan pani became frustrated with milo evi s domineering behaviour during diplomatic talks in 1992 and told milo evi to shut up because milo evi s position was officially subordinate to his position 14 milo evi later forced pani to resign 15 however this situation changed after 1997 when milo evi s second and last legal term as serbian president ended he then had himself elected federal president thus entrenching the power that he already de facto held 5 after the federation was reconstituted as a state union the new assembly of the state union was created it was unicameral and was made up of 126 deputies of which 91 were from serbia and 35 were from montenegro the assembly convened in the building of the old federal assembly of fry which now houses the national assembly of serbia in 2003 after the constitutional changes and creation of the state union of serbia and montenegro a new president of serbia and montenegro was elected he was also president of the council of

economically due to the breakup of yugoslavia and mismanagement of the economy and an extended period of economic sanctions in the early 1990s the fry suffered from hyperinflation of the yugoslav dinar by the mid-1990s the fry had overcome the inflation further damage to yugoslavia s infrastructure and industry caused by the kosovo war left the economy only half the size it was in 1990 since the ousting of former federal yugoslav president slobodan milo evi in october 2000 the democratic opposition of serbia dos coalition government has implemented stabilization measures and embarked on an aggressive market reform program after renewing its membership in the international monetary fund in december 2000 yugoslavia continued to reintegrate with other world nations by rejoining the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development the smaller republic of montenegro severed its economy from federal control and from serbia during the milo evi era afterwards the two republics had separate central banks whilst montenegro began to use different currencies it first adopted the deutsch mark and continued to use it until the mark fell into disuse to be replaced by the euro serbia continued to use the yugoslav dinar renaming it the serbian dinar the complexity of the fry s political relationships slow progress in privatisation and stagnation in the european economy were detrimental to the economy arrangements with the imf especially requirements for fiscal discipline were an important element in policy formation severe unemployment was a key political and economic problem corruption also presented a major problem with a large black market and a high degree of criminal involvement in the formal economy transport edit a federal republic of yugoslavia

yugoslav tricolour was to be replaced by a new compromise flag article 23 of the law for the implementation of the constitutional charter 17 stated that a law specifying the new flag was to be passed within 60 days of the first session of the new joint parliament among the flag proposals the popular choice was a flag with a shade of blue in between the serbian tricolour and the montenegrin tricolour of 1993 2004 the colour shade pantone 300c was perceived as the best choice 18 however the parliament failed to vote on the proposal within the legal time-frame and the flag was not adopted in 2004 montenegro adopted a radically different flag as its independence-leaning government sought to distance itself from serbia proposals for a compromise flag were dropped after this and the union of serbia and montenegro never adopted a flag a similar fate befell the country s anthem and coat-of-arms to be the above-mentioned article 23 also stipulated that a law determining the state union s flag and anthem was to be passed by the end of 2003 the official proposal for an anthem was a combination piece consisting of one verse of the serbian anthem bo e pravde followed by a verse of the montenegrin anthem oj svijetla majska zoro this proposal was dropped after some public opposition notably by serbian patriarch pavle 19 another legal deadline passed and no anthem was adopted serious proposals for the coat of arms were never put forward probably because the coat of arms of the fry adopted in 1994 combining serbian and montenegrin heraldic elements was considered adequate thus the state union never officially adopted state symbols and continued to use the flag and anthem of the federal republic of yugoslavia by inertia until its dissolution in 2006 sports edit football edit fr yugoslavia later serbia and montenegro was considered by fifa and uefa to be the only successor-state of yugoslavia 20 21 22 football was experiencing major success during the 1980s and early 1990s however due to the imposed economic sanctions the country was excluded from all international competitions between 1992 and 1996 after the sanctions were lifted the national team qualified for two fifa world cups in 1998 as fr yugoslavia and in 2006 as serbia and montenegro it also qualified for euro 2000 the 1998 world cup appearance in france was accompanied with plenty of expectation and quiet confidence as the team was considered to be one of the tournament s dark horses due to being stacked with proven world-class players such as 29-year-old predrag mijatovi 33-year-old dragan stojkovi 29-year-old sini a mihajlovi 28-year-old vladimir jugovi and 31-year-old dejan savi evi as well as emerging 19-year-old youngster dejan stankovi and tall 24-year-old target forwards savo milo evi and darko kova evi another reason for heightened expectations was the fact this was the country s first major international appearance following the un-imposed exile however the talented squad never managed to hit top gear although it did make it out of the group it got eliminated by the netherlands via an injury-time goal in the round-of-16 two years later at euro 2000 virtually the same team again made it out of the group and was again eliminated out of the tournament by the netherlands this time convincingly 1 6 in the quarter finals the country was also represented at the 1996 summer olympic games the 2000 summer olympic games and the 2004 summer olympic games serbia and montenegro were represented by a single football team in the 2006 fifa world cup tournament despite
