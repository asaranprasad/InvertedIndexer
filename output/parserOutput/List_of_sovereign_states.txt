sovereignty disputed criteria for inclusion the dominant customary international law standard of statehood is the declarative theory of statehood which was codified by the montevideo convention of 1933 the convention defines the state as a person of international law if it possess es the following qualifications a a permanent population b a defined territory c government and d a capacity to enter into relations with the other states so long as it was not obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms in threatening diplomatic representations or in any other effective coercive measure 71 improper synthesis debate exists on the degree to which recognition should be included as a criterion of statehood the declarative theory of statehood argues that statehood is purely objective and recognition of a state by other states is irrelevant on the other end of the spectrum the constitutive theory of statehood defines a state as a person under international law only
