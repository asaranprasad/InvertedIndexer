references overview edit the most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures one of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the ideal gas law which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures however this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid therefore a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids at present there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions measurements of equation-of-state parameters especially at high pressures can be made using lasers 2 3 4 in addition there are also equations of state describing solids including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another there are equations that model the interior of stars including neutron stars dense matter quark gluon plasmas and radiation fields a related concept is the perfect fluid equation of state used in cosmology in practical context the equations of state are instrumental for pvt calculation in process engineering problems and especially in petroleum gas liquid equilibrium calculations a successful pvt model based on a fitting equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime the parameters for handling the reservoir fluids piping and sizing historical edit boyle s law 1662 edit boyle s law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state citation needed in 1662 the irish physicist and chemist robert boyle performed a series of experiments employing a j-shaped glass tube which was sealed on one end mercury was added to the tube trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short sealed end of the tube then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube the pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long open end through these experiments boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure in mathematical form this can be stated as p v c o n s t a n t displaystyle pv mathrm constant the above relationship has also been attributed to edme mariotte and is sometimes referred to as mariotte s law however mariotte s work was not published until 1676 charles s law or law of charles and gay-lussac 1787 edit in 1787 the french physicist jacques charles found that oxygen nitrogen hydrogen carbon dioxide and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval later in 1802 joseph louis gay-lussac published results of similar experiments indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature v 1 t 1 v 2 t 2 displaystyle frac v 1 t 1 frac v 2 t 2 dalton s law of partial pressures 1801 edit dalton s law of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone mathematically this can be represented for n species as p total p 1 p 2 p n p total i 1 n p i displaystyle p text total p 1 p 2 cdots p n p text total sum i 1 n p i the ideal gas law 1834 edit in 1834 mile clapeyron combined boyle s law and charles law into the first statement of the ideal gas law initially the law was formulated as pvm r tc 267 with temperature expressed in degrees celsius where r is the gas constant however later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2 and then the celsius scale was defined with 0 c 273.15 k giving p v m r t c 273.15 c displaystyle pv m r t c 273.15 circ c van der waals equation of state 1873 edit in 1873 j d van der waals introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules 5 his new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state and was most famously continued via the redlich kwong equation of state and the soave modification of redlich-kwong major equations of state edit for a given amount of substance contained in a system the temperature volume and pressure are not independent quantities they are connected by a relationship of the general form f p v t 0 displaystyle f p v t 0 in the following equations the variables are defined as follows any consistent set of units may be used although si units are preferred absolute temperature refers to use of the kelvin k or rankine r temperature scales with zero

the form shown above the equation of state is thus f p v t p v n r t 0 displaystyle f p v t pv-nrt 0 if the calorically perfect gas approximation is used then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows p 1 e displaystyle p rho gamma -1 e where displaystyle rho is the density c p c v displaystyle gamma c p c v is the adiabatic index ratio of specific heats e c v t displaystyle e c v t is the internal energy per unit mass the specific internal energy c v displaystyle c v is the specific heat at constant volume and c p displaystyle c p is the specific heat at constant pressure cubic equations of state edit cubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a cubic function of vm van der waals equation of state edit the van der waals equation of state may be written p a v m 2 v m b r t displaystyle left p frac a v m 2 right left v m -b right rt where v m displaystyle v m is molar volume the substance-specific constants a displaystyle a and b displaystyle

van der waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law in this landmark equation a displaystyle a is called the attraction parameter and b displaystyle b the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume while the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms while the van der waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons it is now obsolete other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate the van der waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law improved due to two independent reasons molecules are thought as particles with volume not material points thus v m displaystyle v m cannot be too little less than some constant so we get v m b displaystyle v m -b instead of v m displaystyle v m while ideal gas molecules do not interact we consider molecules attracting others within a distance of several molecules radii it makes no effect inside the material but surface molecules are attracted into the material from the surface we see this as diminishing of pressure on the outer shell which is used in the ideal gas law so we write p displaystyle p something instead of p displaystyle p to evaluate this something let s examine an additional force acting on an element of gas surface while the force acting on each surface molecule is displaystyle rho the force acting on the whole element is 2 displaystyle rho 2 1 v m 2 displaystyle frac 1 v m 2 with the reduced state variables i e vr vm vc pr p pc and tr t tc the reduced form of the van der waals equation can be formulated p r 3 v r 2

primarily due to its relatively simple form while superior to the van der waals equation of state it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating vapor liquid equilibria however it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose the redlich-kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties

soave 6 replaced the 1 t term of the redlich-kwong equation with a function t involving the temperature and the acentric factor the resulting equation is also known as the soave-redlich-kwong equation of state srk eos the function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials note especially that this replacement changes the

displaystyle b frac 0.08664 r t c p c where displaystyle alpha and other parts of the srk eos is defined in the srk eos section a downside of the srk eos and other cubic eos is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume peneloux et alios 1982 7 proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation v m s r k v m c displaystyle v msrk v m c where c displaystyle c is an additional fluid component parameter that translate the molar volume slightly on the liquid branch of the eos a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure on the gas branch of the eos a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch thus the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small unfortunately there are two versions that occur in science and industry in the first version only v m s r k displaystyle v msrk is translated 8 9 and the eos becomes p r t v m c b a v m c v m

feature with the volume translation method of peneloux et alios 1982 is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations 11 it should be noted that this method of volume translation

acentric factor of the species r displaystyle r is the universal gas constant and z pv nrt is compressibility factor the peng robinson equation of state pr eos was developed in 1976 at the university of alberta by ding-yu peng and donald robinson in order to satisfy the following goals 12 the parameters should be expressible in terms of the critical properties and the acentric factor the model should provide reasonable accuracy near the critical point particularly for calculations of the compressibility factor and liquid density the mixing rules should not employ more than a single binary interaction parameter which should be independent of temperature pressure and composition the equation should be applicable to all calculations of all fluid properties in natural gas processes for the most part the peng robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the soave equation although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials especially nonpolar ones 13 the departure functions of the peng robinson equation are given on a separate article peng robinson-stryjek-vera equations of state edit prsv1 edit a modification to the attraction term in the peng robinson equation of state published by stryjek and vera in 1986 prsv significantly improved the model s accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial

component parameters prsv2 is particularly advantageous for vle calculations while prsv1 does offer an advantage over the peng robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior it is still not accurate enough in general for phase equilibrium calculations 14 the highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors it is therefore recommended that prsv2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design however once the equilibrium state has been determined the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy 15 one thing to note is that in the prsv equation the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature above the critical temperature the prsv alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0 because of this alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point this is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point several alternate formulations have been proposed some well known ones are by twu et all or by mathias and copeman elliott suresh donohue equation of state edit the elliott suresh and donohue esd equation of state was proposed in 1990 16 the equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the peng robinson eos in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der waals repulsive term the eos accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term not shown the eos itself was developed

more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state especially for systems containing liquids or solids 21 22 multiparameter equations of state edit helmholtz function form edit

is another constant representing the molecular attraction between water molecules the magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals 20,000 atmospheres the equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by c 2 p p 0 displaystyle c 2 gamma p p 0 rho thus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is already under about 20,000 atmospheres 2 gpa pressure and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres 100 kpa to 200 kpa the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres 2000.1 mpa to 2000.2 mpa this equation mispredicts the specific heat capacity of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic
