the 16th century the british and french established colonies the first being the colony of canada established by france in 1535 as a consequence of various armed conflicts british north america gained and lost territory until by the late 18th century it controlled most of what comprises canada today on july 1 1867 the colonies of canada new brunswick and nova scotia were federated to form the semi-autonomous federal dominion named canada this began an accretion of provinces and territories to the dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming contemporary canada canada achieved independence gradually beginning with responsible government in the 1830s and culminating with the patriation of the constitution in 1982 in 1931 canada achieved near-total independence from

origins of canada the name is now accepted as coming from the st lawrence iroquoian word kanata meaning village or settlement 11 in 1535 indigenous inhabitants of the present-day quebec city region used the word to direct french explorer jacques cartier to the village of stadacona 12 cartier later used the word canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to donnacona the chief at stadacona 12 by 1545 european books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the saint lawrence river as canada 12 from the 16th to the early 18th century canada referred to the part of new france that lay along the saint lawrence river 13 in 1791 the area became two british colonies called upper canada and lower canada collectively named the canadas until their union as the british province of canada in 1841 14 upon confederation in 1867 canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the london conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country s title 15 the transition away from the use of dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the canada act which refers only to canada later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from dominion day to canada day 16 the term dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces though after the second world war the term federal had replaced dominion 17 history indigenous peoples linguistic areas of north american indigenous peoples at the time of european contact indigenous peoples in present-day canada include the first nations inuit and m tis 18 the latter being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when first nations and inuit people married european settlers 18 the term aboriginal as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents including the constitution act 1982 19 the first inhabitants of north america are generally hypothesized to have migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge 20 and arrived at least 15,000 years ago though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival 21 22 23 24 the paleo-indian archeological sites at old crow flats and bluefish caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in canada 25 the characteristics of canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements agriculture complex societal hierarchies and trading networks 26 27 some of these cultures had collapsed by the time european explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations 28 the indigenous population at the time of the first european settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 29 and two million 30 with a figure of 500,000 accepted by canada s royal commission on aboriginal peoples 31 as a consequence of european colonization the population of canada s indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent and several first nations such as the beothuk disappeared 32 the decline is attributed to several causes including the transfer of european diseases such as influenza measles and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity 29 33 conflicts over the fur trade conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers and the loss of indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations self-sufficiency 34 35 although not without conflict european canadians early interactions with first nations and inuit populations were relatively peaceful 36 first nations and m tis peoples played a critical part in the development of european colonies in canada particularly for their role in assisting european coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the north american fur trade 37 the crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the european colonization period though the inuit in general had more limited interaction with european settlers 38 however from the late 18th century european canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture 39 these attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations 40 a period of redress is underway which started with the appointment of the truth and reconciliation commission of canada by the government of canada in 2008 41 european colonization the first known attempt at european colonization began when norsemen settled briefly at l anse aux meadows in newfoundland around 1000 ad 42 no further european exploration occurred until 1497 when italian seafarer john cabot explored and claimed canada s atlantic coast in the name of king henry vii of england 43 44 then basque and portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the atlantic coast in the early 16th century 45 in 1534 french explorer jacques cartier explored the gulf of saint lawrence where on july 24 he planted a 10-metre 33 ft cross bearing the words long live the king of france and took possession of the territory new france in the name of king francis i 46 in general the settlements appear to have been short-lived possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in scandinavia and northern canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that time 47 in 1583 sir humphrey gilbert by the royal prerogative of queen elizabeth i founded st john s newfoundland as the first north american english colony 48 french explorer samuel de champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent european settlements at port royal in 1605 and quebec city in 1608 49 among the colonists of new france canadiens extensively settled the saint lawrence river valley and acadians settled the present-day maritimes while fur traders and catholic missionaries explored the great lakes hudson bay and the mississippi watershed to louisiana 50 the beaver wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the north american fur trade 51 benjamin west s the death of general wolfe 1771 dramatizes james wolfe s death during the battle of the plains of abraham at quebec the english established additional settlements in newfoundland beginning in 1610 52 and the thirteen colonies to the south were founded soon after 45 a series of four wars erupted in colonial north america between 1689 and 1763 the later wars of the period constituted the north american theatre of the seven years war 53 mainland nova scotia came under british rule with the 1713 treaty of utrecht and canada and most of new france came under british rule in 1763 after the seven years war 54 the royal proclamation of 1763 established first nation treaty rights created the province of quebec out of new france and annexed cape breton island to nova scotia 16 st john s island now prince edward island became a separate colony in 1769 55 to avert conflict in quebec the british parliament passed the quebec act of 1774 expanding quebec s territory to the great lakes and ohio valley more importantly the quebec act afforded quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time that the thirteen colonies were increasingly agitating against british rule 56 it re-established the french language catholic faith and french civil law there staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the thirteen colonies the proclamation and the quebec act in turn angered many residents of the thirteen colonies further fuelling anti-british sentiment in the years prior to the american revolution 16 after the successful american war of independence the 1783 treaty of paris recognized the independence of the newly formed united state and set the terms of peace ceding british north american territories south of the great lakes to the new country 57 the american war of independence also caused a large out-migration of loyalists the settlers who had fought against american independence many moved to canada particularly atlantic canada where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories new brunswick was in turn split from nova scotia as part of a reorganization of loyalist settlements in the maritimes 58 to accommodate the influx of english-speaking loyalists in central canada the constitutional act of 1791 divided the province of canada into french-speaking lower canada later quebec and english-speaking upper canada later ontario granting each its own elected legislative assembly 59 the canadas were the main front in the war of 1812 between the united states and the united kingdom peace came in 1815 no boundaries were changed immigration resumed at a higher level with over 960,000 arrivals from britain between 1815 50 60 new arrivals included refugees escaping the great irish famine as well as gaelic-speaking scots displaced by the highland clearances 61 infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of europeans who immigrated to canada before 1891 29 the desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive rebellions of 1837 62 the durham report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of french canadians into english culture 16 the act of union merged the canadas into a united province of canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of british north america by 1849 63 the signing of the oregon treaty by britain and the united states in 1846 ended the oregon boundary dispute extending the border westward along the 49th parallel this paved the way for british colonies on vancouver island 1849 and in british columbia 1858 64 in 1867 the same year as canadian confederation britain declined to purchase for canada the alaska territory that was to that point tenuously held by russia with the united states purchasing alaska instead clearly demarcated borders for canada although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarcation of the alaska-yukon and alaska-bc border for years to come 65 confederation and expansion an animated map showing the growth and change of canada s provinces and territories since confederation in 1867 following several constitutional conferences the constitution act officially proclaimed canadian confederation on july 1 1867 initially with four provinces ontario quebec nova scotia and new brunswick 66 67 canada assumed control of rupert s land and the north-western territory to form the northwest territories where the m tis grievances ignited the red river rebellion and the creation of the province of manitoba in july 1870 68 british columbia and vancouver island which had been united in 1866 joined the confederation in 1871 while prince edward island joined in 1873 69 to open the west to european immigration parliament also approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways including the canadian pacific railway opening the prairies to settlement with the dominion lands act and establishing the north-west mounted police to assert its authority over this territory 70 71 in 1898 during the klondike gold rush in the northwest territories parliament created the yukon territory alberta and saskatchewan became provinces in 1905 69 early 20th century canadian soldiers and a mark ii tank at the battle of vimy ridge in 1917 because britain still maintained control of canada s foreign affairs under the constitution act 1867 its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought canada into world war i 72 volunteers sent to the western front later became part of the canadian corps which played a substantial role in the battle of vimy ridge and other major engagements of the war 73 out of approximately 625,000 canadians who served in world war i some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded 74 the conscription crisis of 1917 erupted when the unionist cabinet s proposal to augment the military s dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from french-speaking quebecers 75 the military service act brought in compulsory military service though it coupled with disputes over french language schools outside quebec deeply alienated francophone canadians and temporarily split the liberal party 75 in 1919 canada joined the league of nations independently of britain 73 and the 1931 statute of westminster affirmed canada s independence 4 canadian crew of a sherman tank south of vaucelles france during the battle of normandy in june 1944 the great depression in canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn leading to hardship across the country 76 in response to the downturn the co-operative commonwealth federation ccf in saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state as pioneered by tommy douglas in the 1940s and 1950s 77 on the advice of prime minister william lyon mackenzie king war with germany was declared effective september 10 1939 by king george vi seven days after the united kingdom the delay underscored canada s independence 73 the first canadian army units arrived in britain in december 1939 in all over a million canadians served in the armed forces during world war ii and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded 78 canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war including the failed 1942 dieppe raid the allied invasion of italy the normandy landings the battle of normandy and the battle of the scheldt in 1944 73 canada provided asylum for the dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from nazi germany 79 the canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for canada britain china and the soviet union 73 despite another conscription crisis in quebec in 1944 canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy 80 contemporary era at rideau hall governor general the viscount alexander of tunis centre receives the bill finalizing the union of newfoundland and canada on march 31 1949 the financial crisis of the great depression had led the dominion of newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a british governor 81 after two bitter referendums newfoundlanders voted to join canada in 1949 as a province 82 canada s post-war economic growth combined with the policies of successive liberal governments led to the emergence of a new canadian identity marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965 83 the implementation of official bilingualism english and french in 1969 84 and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971 85 socially democratic programs were also instituted such as medicare the canada pension plan and canada student loans though provincial governments particularly quebec and alberta opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions 86 finally another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the canada act the patriation of canada s constitution from the united kingdom concurrent with the creation of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms 87 88 89 canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country although the queen retained her role as monarch of canada 90 91 in 1999

and the sovereignist parti qu b cois was elected in 1976 organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980 attempts to accommodate quebec nationalism constitutionally through the meech lake accord failed in 1990 95 this led to the formation of the bloc qu b cois in quebec and the invigoration of the reform party of canada in the west 96 97 a second referendum followed in 1995 in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent 98 in 1997 the supreme court ruled that unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the clarity act was passed by parliament outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from confederation 95 in addition to the issues of quebec sovereignty a number of crises shook canadian society in the late
