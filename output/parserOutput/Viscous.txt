viscosity - wikipedia viscosity from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from viscous jump to navigation search viscosity dynamic a simulation of liquids with different viscosities the liquid on the right has higher viscosity than the liquid on the left common symbols derivations from other quantities g t the viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to gradual deformation by shear stress or tensile stress 1 for liquids it corresponds to the informal concept of thickness for example honey has a much higher viscosity than water 2 viscosity is a property of the fluid which opposes the relative motion between the two surfaces of the fluid that are moving at different velocities in simple terms viscosity means friction between the molecules of fluid when the fluid is forced through a tube the particles which compose the fluid generally move more quickly near the tube s axis and more slowly near its walls therefore some stress such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube is needed to overcome the friction between particle layers to keep the fluid moving for a given velocity pattern the stress required is proportional to the fluid s viscosity a fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids otherwise all fluids have positive viscosity and are technically said to be viscous or viscid in common parlance however a liquid is said to be viscous if its viscosity is substantially greater than that of water and may be described as mobile if the viscosity is noticeably less than water according to whom not verified in body a fluid with a relatively high viscosity such as pitch may appear to be a solid contents 1 etymology 2 definition

meaning mistletoe and also a viscous glue made from mistletoe berries 3 definition edit dynamic shear viscosity edit laminar shear of fluid between two plates and cups friction between the fluid and the moving boundaries plates causes the fluid to shear and cut the force required for this action is a measure of the fluid s viscosity in a general parallel flow such as could occur in a straight pipe the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity the dynamic viscosity of a fluid expresses its resistance to shearing flows where adjacent layers move parallel to each other with different speeds it can be defined through the idealized situation known as a couette flow where a layer of fluid is trapped between two horizontal plates one fixed and one moving horizontally at constant speed u displaystyle u this fluid has to be homogeneous in the layer and at different shear stresses the plates are assumed to be very large so that one need not consider what happens near their edges if the speed of the top plate is low enough the fluid particles will move parallel to it and their speed will vary linearly from zero at the bottom to u at the top each layer of fluid will move faster than the one just below it and friction between them will give rise to a force resisting their relative motion in particular the fluid will apply on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion and an equal but opposite one to the bottom plate an external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed the magnitude f of this force is found to be proportional to the speed u and the area a of each plate and inversely proportional to their separation y f a u y displaystyle f mu a frac u y the proportionality factor in this formula is the viscosity specifically the dynamic viscosity of the fluid with units of p a s displaystyle pa cdot s pascal-second the ratio u y is called the rate of shear deformation or shear velocity and is the derivative of the fluid speed in the direction perpendicular to the plates see illustrations to the right isaac newton expressed the viscous forces by the differential equation u y displaystyle tau mu frac partial u partial y where f a and u y is the local shear velocity this formula assumes that the flow is moving along parallel lines to x-axis furthermore it assumes that the y-axis perpendicular to the flow points in the direction of maximum shear velocity this equation can be used where the velocity does not vary linearly with y such as in fluid flowing through a pipe this equation is called the defining equation for shear viscosity the viscosity is not a material constant but a material property that depends on physical properties like temperature the functional relationship between viscosity and other physical properties is described by a mathematical viscosity model called a constitutive equation which is usually fare more complex than the defining equation for viscosity there exists many viscosity models and based on type of development-reasoning are some viscosity models selected and presented in the article viscosity models for mixtures use of the greek letter mu for the dynamic stress viscosity is common among mechanical and chemical engineers as well as physicists 4 5 6 however the greek letter eta is also used by chemists physicists and the iupac 7 kinematic viscosity edit the kinematic viscosity also called momentum diffusivity is the ratio of the dynamic viscosity to the density of the fluid it is usually denoted by the greek letter nu and has units m 2 s displaystyle mathrm m 2 s displaystyle nu frac mu rho it is a convenient concept when analyzing the reynolds number which expresses the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces r e u l u l displaystyle mathrm re frac rho ul mu frac ul nu where l is a typical length scale in the system and u is the velocity of the fluid with respect to the object m s bulk viscosity edit when a compressible fluid is compressed or expanded evenly without shear it may still exhibit a form of internal friction that resists its flow these forces are related to the rate of compression or expansion by a factor called the volume viscosity bulk viscosity or second viscosity the bulk viscosity is important only when the fluid is being rapidly compressed or expanded such as in sound and shock waves bulk viscosity explains the loss of energy in those waves as described by stokes law of sound attenuation viscosity tensor edit in general the stresses within a flow can be attributed partly to the deformation of the material from some rest state elastic stress and partly to the rate of change of the deformation over time viscous stress in a fluid by definition the elastic stress includes only the hydrostatic pressure in very general terms the fluid s viscosity is the relation between the strain rate and the viscous stress in the newtonian fluid model the relationship is by definition a linear map described by a viscosity tensor that multiplied by the strain rate tensor which is the gradient of the flow s velocity gives the viscous stress tensor the viscosity tensor has nine independent degrees of freedom in general for isotropic newtonian fluids these can be reduced to two independent parameters the most usual decomposition yields the dynamic viscosity and the bulk viscosity newtonian and non-newtonian fluids edit viscosity the slope of each line varies among materials newton s law of viscosity is a constitutive equation like hooke s law fick s law ohm s law it is not a fundamental law of nature but an approximation that holds in some materials and fails in others a fluid that behaves according to newton s law with a viscosity that is independent of the stress is said to be newtonian gases water and many common liquids can be considered newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts there are many non-newtonian fluids that significantly deviate from that law in some way or other for example shear-thickening liquids whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain shear-thinning liquids whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain thixotropic liquids that become less viscous over time when shaken agitated or otherwise stressed rheopectic dilatant liquids that become more viscous over time when shaken agitated or otherwise stressed bingham plastics that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses shear-thinning liquids are very commonly but misleadingly described as thixotropic even for a newtonian fluid the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature for gases and other compressible fluids it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure the viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors a magnetorheological fluid for example becomes thicker when subjected to a magnetic field possibly to the point of behaving like a solid viscosity in solids edit the viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the elastic forces that arise in a solid in response to shear compression or extension stresses while in the latter the stress is proportional to the amount of shear deformation in a fluid it is proportional to the rate of deformation over time for this reason maxwell used the term fugitive elasticity for fluid viscosity however many liquids including water will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress conversely many solids even granite will flow like liquids albeit very slowly even under arbitrarily small stress 8 such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity reaction to deformation and viscosity reaction to rate of deformation that is being viscoelastic indeed some authors have claimed that amorphous solids such as glass and many polymers are actually liquids with a very high viscosity greater than 1012 pa s 9 however other authors dispute this hypothesis claiming instead that there is some threshold for the stress below which most solids will not flow at all 10 and that alleged instances of glass flow in window panes of old buildings are due to the crude manufacturing process of older eras rather than to the viscosity of glass 11 viscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity the extensional viscosity is a linear combination of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation it is widely used for characterizing polymers in geology earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three orders of magnitude greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called rheids 12 viscosity measurement edit viscosity is measured with various types of viscometers and rheometers a rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements particularly in materials like lubricants whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5 c for some fluids the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates newtonian fluids the fluids without a constant viscosity non-newtonian fluids cannot be described by a single number non-newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate one of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer in coating industries viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the efflux time is measured there are several sorts of cup such as the zahn cup and the ford viscosity cup with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry the efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities centistokes cst through the conversion equations 13 also used in coatings a stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity the viscosity is reported in krebs units ku which are unique to stormer viscometers vibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity resonant or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid in this method the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency as the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid energy is lost due to its viscosity this dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading a higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy citation needed extensional viscosity can be measured with various rheometers that apply extensional stress volume viscosity can be measured with an acoustic rheometer apparent viscosity is a calculation derived from tests performed on drilling fluid used in oil or gas well development these calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required units edit dynamic viscosity edit both the physical unit of dynamic viscosity in si units the poiseuille pl and cgs units the poise p are named after jean l onard marie poiseuille the poiseuille which is rarely used is equivalent to the pascal second pa s or n s m2 or kg m s if a fluid is placed between two plates with distance one meter and one plate is pushed sideways with a shear stress of one pascal and it moves at x meters per second then it has viscosity of 1 x pascal seconds for example water at 20 c has a viscosity of 1.002 mpa s while a typical motor oil could have a viscosity of about 250 mpa s 14 the units used in practice are either pa s and its submultiples or the cgs poise referred to below and its submultiples the cgs physical unit for dynamic viscosity the poise 15 p is also named after jean poiseuille it is more commonly expressed particularly in astm standards as centipoise cp since the latter is equal to the si multiple millipascal seconds mpa s for example water at 20 c has a viscosity of 1.002 mpa s 1.002 cp 1 pl 1 pa s 1 p 1 dpa s 0.1 pa s 0.1 kg m 1 s 1 1 cp 1 mpa s 0.001 pa s 0.001 n s m 2 0.001 kg m 1 s 1 kinematic viscosity edit the si unit of kinematic viscosity is m2 s the cgs physical unit for kinematic viscosity is the stokes st named after george gabriel stokes it is sometimes expressed in terms of centistokes cst in u s usage stoke is sometimes used as the singular form 1 st 1 cm 2 s 1 10 4 m 2 s 1 1 cst 1 mm 2 s 1 10 6 m 2 s 1 water at 20 c has a kinematic viscosity of about 10 6 m2 s 1 or 1 cst the kinematic viscosity is sometimes referred to as diffusivity of momentum because it is analogous to diffusivity of heat and diffusivity of mass it is therefore used in dimensionless numbers which compare the ratio of the diffusivities fluidity edit the reciprocal of viscosity is fluidity usually symbolized by 1 or f 1 depending on the convention used measured in reciprocal poise p 1 or cm s g 1 sometimes called the rhe fluidity is seldom used in engineering practice the concept of fluidity can be used to determine the viscosity of an ideal solution for two components a and b the fluidity when a and b are mixed is f a f a b f b displaystyle f approx chi mathrm a f mathrm a chi mathrm b f mathrm b which is only slightly simpler than the equivalent equation in terms of

the components pure viscosities non-standard units edit the reyn is a british unit of dynamic viscosity viscosity index is a measure for the change of kinematic viscosity with temperature it is used in the automotive industry to characterise lubricating oil at one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the saybolt viscometer and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of saybolt universal seconds sus 16 other abbreviations such as ssu saybolt seconds universal or suv saybolt universal viscosity are sometimes used kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from sus according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in astm d 2161 17 molecular origins edit pitch has a viscosity approximately 230 billion 7011229999999999999 2.3 1011 times that of water 18 the viscosity of a system is determined by how molecules constituting the system interact there are no simple but correct expressions for the viscosity of a fluid the simplest exact expressions are the green kubo relations for the linear shear viscosity or the transient time correlation function expressions derived by evans and morriss in 1985 19 although these expressions are each exact in order to calculate the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of molecular dynamics computer simulations gases edit viscosity in gases arises principally from the molecular diffusion that transports momentum between layers of flow the kinetic theory of gases allows accurate prediction of the behavior of gaseous viscosity within the regime where the theory is applicable viscosity is independent of pressure and viscosity increases as temperature increases 20 james clerk maxwell published a famous paper in 1866 using the kinetic theory of gases to study gaseous viscosity 21 to understand why the viscosity is independent of pressure consider two adjacent boundary layers a and b moving with respect to each other the internal friction the viscosity of the gas is determined by the probability a particle of layer a enters layer b with a corresponding transfer of momentum maxwell s calculations show that the viscosity coefficient is proportional to the density the mean free path and the mean velocity of the atoms on the other hand the mean free path is inversely proportional to the density so an increase in density due to an increase in pressure doesn t result in any change in viscosity relation to mean free path of diffusing particles edit in relation to diffusion the kinematic viscosity provides a better understanding of the behavior of mass transport of a dilute species viscosity is related to shear stress and the rate of shear in a fluid which illustrates its dependence on the mean free path of the diffusing particles from fluid mechanics for a newtonian fluid the shear stress on a unit area moving parallel to itself is found to be proportional to the rate of change of velocity

dye for visibility in liquids the additional forces between molecules become important this leads to an additional contribution to the shear stress though the exact mechanics of this are still controversial citation needed thus in liquids viscosity is independent of pressure except at very high pressure and viscosity tends to fall as temperature increases for example water viscosity goes from 1.79 cp to 0.28 cp in the temperature range from 0 c to 100 c see temperature dependence of liquid viscosity for more details the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically several orders of magnitude higher than dynamic viscosities of gases viscosity of blends of liquids edit the viscosity of the blend of two or more liquids can be estimated using the refutas equation 27 28 the
