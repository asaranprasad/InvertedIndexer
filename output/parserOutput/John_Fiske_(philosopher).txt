practised law his career as author began in 1861 with an article on mr buckle s fallacies published in the national quarterly review after that he was a frequent contributor to american and british periodicals 1 from 1869 to 1871 he was university lecturer on philosophy at harvard in 1870 instructor in history there and assistant librarian 1872-1879 on resigning the latter position in 1879 he was elected a member of the board of overseers and at the expiration of the six-years term was re-elected in 1885 beginning in 1881 he lectured annually on american history at washington university st

university college london in 1879 and at the royal institution of great britain in 1880 he gave many hundreds of lectures chiefly upon american history in the principal cities of the united states and great britain 1 fiske was elected a member of the american antiquarian society in 1884 2 the largest part of his life was devoted to the study of history but at an early age inquiries into the nature of human progress led him to a careful study of the doctrine of evolution and it was through the popularization of charles darwin s work that he first became known to the public 1 he applied himself to the philosophical interpretation of darwin s work and produced many books and essays on this subject his philosophy was influenced by herbert spencer s views on evolution in a letter from charles darwin to john fiske dated from 1874 the naturalist remarks i never in my life read so lucid an expositor and therefore thinker as you are professor john fiske flies the evolution kite in america daily graphic september 12 1874 nineteenth-century enthusiasm for brain size as a simple measure of human performance championed by scientists including darwin s cousin francis galton and the french neurologist paul broca led fiske to believe in the racial superiority of the anglo-saxon race fiske s beliefs on race did not preclude his commitment to abolitionist causes indeed so anti-slavery was he that twenty-three years after the cessation of the american civil war he declared the north s victory complete despite the feeble wails of unteachable bigots 3 in his book the destiny of man 1884 he devotes a whole chapter to the end of the working of natural selection upon man describing it as a fact of unparalleled grandeur in his view the action of natural selection upon man has been essentially diminished through the operation of social conditions in books such as outlines of cosmic philosophy isbn 0-384-15780-7 fiske aimed to show that in reality there has never been any conflict between religion and science nor is any reconciliation called for where harmony has always existed on page 364 he demonstrates his sensitivity to christianity as a religion we arrive at a deeper reason than has hitherto been disclosed for the difference between our position with reference to christianity and that which has been assumed by radicalism and by positivism it is not merely that we refuse to attack christianity because we recognize its necessary adaptation to a certain stage of culture not yet passed by the average minds of the community it is that we still regard christianity as in the deepest sense our own religion 4 fiske was a popular lecturer on these topics in his early career later he turned to historical writings publishing books such as the discovery of america 1892 in addition he edited with james grant wilson appletons cyclop dia of american biography 1887 he died worn out by overwork at gloucester massachusetts july 4 1901 bibliography edit
