biotite and or amphibole composition potassium feldspar plagioclase feldspar and quartz differing amounts of muscovite biotite and hornblende-type amphiboles granite r n t is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture granites can be predominantly white pink or gray in color depending on their mineralogy the word granite comes from the latin granum a grain in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock strictly speaking granite is an igneous rock with between 20 and 60 quartz by volume and at least 35 of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar the term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin these rocks mainly consist of feldspar quartz mica and amphibole minerals which form an interlocking somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole often hornblende peppering the lighter color minerals occasionally some individual crystals phenocrysts are larger than the groundmass in which case the texture is known as porphyritic a granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry granitoid is a general descriptive field term for lighter-colored coarse-grained igneous rocks petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids 1 the extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite 2 granite is nearly always massive lacking any internal structures hard and tough and therefore it has gained widespread use throughout human history as a construction stone the average density of granite is between 2.65 and 2.75 g cm3 165.4 - 171.7 lb ft3 3 its compressive strength usually lies above 200 mpa and its viscosity near stp is 3 6 1019 pa s 4 the melting temperature of dry granite at ambient pressure is 1215 1260 c 2219 2300 f 5 it is strongly reduced in the presence of water down to 650 c at a few kbar pressure 6

rocks mineral assemblage of igneous rocks granite is classified according to the qapf diagram for coarse grained plutonic rocks and is named according to the percentage of quartz alkali feldspar orthoclase sanidine or microcline and plagioclase feldspar on the a-q-p half of the diagram true granite according to modern petrologic convention contains both plagioclase and alkali feldspars when a granitoid is devoid or nearly devoid of plagioclase the rock is referred to as alkali feldspar granite when a granitoid contains less than 10 orthoclase it is called tonalite pyroxene and amphibole are common in tonalite a granite containing both muscovite and biotite micas is called a binary or two-mica granite two-mica granites are typically high in potassium and low in plagioclase and are

cheesewring a granite tor a granite peak at huangshan china granite rock in the cliff of gros la t te aride island seychelles the thin 1-3 cms wide brighter layers are quartz veins formed during the late stages of crystallization of granitic magmas they are also sometimes called hydrothermal veins granite containing rock is widely distributed throughout the continental crust 9 much of it was intruded during the precambrian age it is the most abundant basement rock that underlies the relatively thin sedimentary veneer of the continents outcrops of granite tend to form tors and rounded massifs granites sometimes occur in circular depressions surrounded by a range of hills formed by the metamorphic aureole or hornfels granite often occurs as relatively small less than 100 km stock masses stocks and in batholiths that are often associated with orogenic mountain ranges small dikes of granitic composition called aplites are often associated with the margins of granitic intrusions in some locations very coarse-grained pegmatite masses occur with granite origin edit granite has a felsic composition and is more common in recent geologic time in contrast to earth s ultramafic ancient igneous history felsic rocks are less dense than mafic and ultramafic rocks and thus they tend to escape subduction whereas basaltic or gabbroic rocks tend to sink into the mantle beneath the granitic rocks of the continental cratons therefore granitic rocks form the basement of all land continents geochemical origins edit granitoids have crystallized from magmas that have compositions at or near a eutectic point or a temperature minimum on a cotectic curve magmas will evolve to the eutectic because of igneous differentiation or because they represent low degrees of partial melting fractional crystallisation serves to reduce a melt in iron magnesium titanium calcium and sodium and enrich the melt in potassium and silicon alkali feldspar rich in potassium and quartz sio2 are two of the defining constituents of granite this process operates regardless of the origin of the parental magma to the granite and regardless of its chemistry however the composition and origin of the magma that differentiates into granite leaves certain geochemical and mineral evidence as to what the granite s parental rock was the final mineralogy texture and chemical composition of a granite is often distinctive as to its origin for instance a granite that is formed from melted sediments may have more alkali feldspar whereas a granite derived from melted basalt may be richer in plagioclase feldspar it is on this basis that the modern alphabet classification schemes are based granite has a slow cooling process which forms larger crystals chappell white classification system edit the letter-based chappell white classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into i-type granite or igneous protolith granite and s-type or sedimentary protolith granite 10 both of these types of granite are formed by the melting of high grade metamorphic rocks either other granite or intrusive mafic rocks or buried sediment respectively m-type or mantle derived granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas generally sourced from the mantle these are rare because it is difficult to turn basalt into granite via fractional crystallisation a-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic hot spot activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry these granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry a-type granites occur in the koettlitz glacier alkaline province in the royal society range antarctica the rhyolites of the yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of a-type granite 11 12 h-type or hybrid granites are formed following a mixing of two granitic magmas from different sources 13 e g m-type and s-type granitization edit an old and largely discounted theory granitization states that granite is formed in place by extreme metasomatism by fluids bringing in elements e g potassium and removing others e g calcium to transform the metamorphic rock into a granite this was supposed to occur across a migrating front the production of granite by metamorphic heat is difficult but is observed to occur in certain amphibolite and granulite terrains in-situ granitisation or melting by metamorphism is difficult to recognise except where leucosome and melanosome textures are present in migmatites once a metamorphic rock is melted it is no longer a metamorphic rock and is a magma so these rocks are seen as a transitional between the two but are not technically granite as they do not actually intrude into other rocks in all cases melting of solid rock requires high temperature and also water or other volatiles which act as a catalyst by lowering the solidus temperature of the rock ascent and emplacement edit the ascent and emplacement of large volumes of granite within the upper continental crust is a source of much debate amongst geologists there is a lack of field evidence for any proposed mechanisms so hypotheses are predominantly based upon experimental data there are two major hypotheses for the ascent of magma through the crust stokes diapir fracture propagation of these two mechanisms stokes diapir was favoured for many years in the absence of a reasonable alternative the basic idea is that magma will rise through the crust as a single mass through buoyancy as it rises it heats the wall rocks causing them to behave as a power-law fluid and thus flow around the pluton allowing it to pass rapidly and without major heat loss 14 this is entirely feasible in the warm ductile lower crust where rocks are easily deformed but runs into problems in the upper crust which is far colder and more brittle rocks there do not deform so easily for magma to rise as a pluton it would expend far too much energy in heating wall rocks thus cooling and solidifying before reaching higher levels within the crust fracture propagation is the mechanism preferred by many geologists as it largely eliminates the major problems of moving a huge mass of magma through cold brittle crust magma rises instead in small channels along self-propagating dykes which form along new or pre-existing fracture or fault systems and networks of active shear zones 15 as these narrow conduits open the first magma to enter solidifies and provides a form of insulation for later magma granitic magma must make room for itself or be intruded into other rocks in order to form an intrusion and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how large batholiths have been emplaced stoping where the granite cracks the wall rocks and pushes upwards as it removes blocks of the overlying crust assimilation where the granite melts its way up into the crust and removes overlying material in this way inflation where the granite body inflates under pressure and is injected into position most geologists today accept that a combination of these phenomena can be used to explain granite intrusions and that not all granites can be explained entirely by one or another mechanism weathering edit grus sand and granitoid it derived from physical weathering occurs on a large scale in the form of exfoliation joints which are the result of granite s expanding and fracturing as pressure is relieved when overlying material is removed by erosion or other processes chemical weathering of granite occurs when dilute carbonic acid and other acids present in rain and soil waters alter feldspar in a process called hydrolysis 16 17 as demonstrated in the following reaction this causes potassium feldspar to form kaolinite with potassium ions bicarbonate and silica in solution as byproducts an end product of granite weathering is grus which is often made up of coarse-grained fragments of disintegrated granite 2 kalsi 3o 8 2 h 2co 3 9 h 2o al 2si 2o 5 oh 4 4 h 4sio 4 2 k 2 hco 3 climatic variations also influence the weathering rate of granites for about two thousand years the relief engravings on cleopatra s needle obelisk had survived the arid conditions of its origin before its transfer to london within two hundred years the red granite has drastically deteriorated in the damp and polluted air there 18 natural radiation edit granite is a natural source of radiation like most natural stones however some granites have been reported to have higher radioactivity thereby raising some concerns about their safety citation needed potassium-40 is a radioactive isotope of weak emission and a constituent of alkali feldspar which in turn is a common component of granitic rocks more abundant in alkali feldspar granite and syenites naturally a geiger counter should register this low effect some granites contain around 10 to 20 parts per million ppm of uranium by contrast more mafic rocks such as tonalite gabbro and diorite have 1 to 5 ppm uranium and limestones and sedimentary rocks usually have equally low amounts many large granite plutons are sources for palaeochannel-hosted or roll front uranium ore deposits where the uranium washes into the sediments from the granite uplands and associated often highly radioactive pegmatites cellars and basements built into soils over granite can become a trap for radon gas which is formed by the decay of uranium 19 radon gas poses significant health concerns and is the number two cause of lung cancer in the us behind smoking 20 thorium occurs in all granites as well 21 conway granite has been noted for its relatively high thorium concentration of 56 6 ppm 22 there is some concern that some granite sold as countertops or building material may be hazardous to health dan steck of st johns university has stated 23 that approximately 5 of all granite is of concern with the caveat that only a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands of granite slab types have been tested various resources from national geological survey organizations are accessible online to assist in assessing the risk factors in granite country and design rules relating in particular to preventing accumulation of radon gas in enclosed basements and dwellings a study of granite countertops was done initiated and paid for by the marble institute of america in november 2008 by national health and engineering inc of usa in this test all of the 39 full-size granite slabs that were measured for the study showed radiation levels well below the european union safety standards section 4.1.1.1 of the national health and engineering study and radon emission levels well below the average outdoor radon concentrations in the us 24 industry edit granite dimension stone quarry in taivassalo finland granite and related marble industries are considered one of the oldest industries in the world existing as far back as ancient egypt 25 major modern exporters of granite include china india italy brazil canada germany sweden spain and the united states 26 indian granite quarries have been mired in controversy over child labor and slavery 27 28 uses edit antiquity edit cleopatra s needle london the red pyramid of egypt c 26th century bc named for the light crimson hue of its exposed limestone surfaces is the third largest of egyptian pyramids menkaure s pyramid likely dating to the same era was constructed of limestone and granite blocks the great pyramid of giza c 2580 bc contains a huge granite sarcophagus fashioned of red aswan granite the mostly ruined black pyramid dating from the reign of amenemhat iii once had a polished granite pyramidion or capstone which is now on display in the main hall of the egyptian museum in cairo see dahshur other uses in ancient egypt include columns door lintels sills jambs and wall and floor veneer 29 how the egyptians worked the solid granite is still a matter of debate patrick hunt 30 has postulated that the egyptians used emery which has greater hardness on the mohs scale rajaraja chola i of the chola dynasty in south india built the world s first temple entirely of granite in the 11th century ad in tanjore india the brihadeeswarar temple dedicated to lord shiva was built in 1010 the massive gopuram ornate upper section of shrine is believed to have a mass of around 81 tonnes it was the tallest temple in south india 31 imperial roman granite was quarried mainly in egypt and also in turkey and on the islands of elba and giglio granite became an integral part of the roman language of monumental architecture 32 the quarrying ceased around the third century ce beginning in late antiquity the granite was reused which since at least the early 16th century became known as spoliation through the process of case-hardening granite becomes harder with age the technology required to make tempered steel chisels was largely forgotten during the middle ages as a result medieval stoneworkers were forced to use saws or emery to shorten ancient columns or hack them into discs giorgio vasari noted in the 16th century that granite in quarries was far softer and easier to work than after it has lain exposed while ancient columns because of their hardness and solidity have nothing to fear from fire or sword and time itself that drives everything to ruin not only has not destroyed them but has not even altered their colour 32 modern edit sculpture and memorials edit various granites cut and polished surfaces in some areas granite is used for gravestones and memorials granite is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand until the early 18th century in the western world granite could be carved only by hand tools with generally poor results a key breakthrough was the invention of steam-powered cutting and dressing tools by alexander macdonald of aberdeen inspired by seeing ancient egyptian granite carvings in 1832 the first polished tombstone of aberdeen granite to be erected in an english cemetery was installed at kensal green cemetery it caused a sensation in the london monumental trade and for some years all polished granite ordered came from macdonald s 33 as a result of the work of sculptor william leslie and later sidney field granite memorials became a major status symbol in victorian britain the royal sarcophagus at frogmore was probably the pinnacle of its work and at 30 tons one of the largest it was not until the 1880s that rival machinery and works could compete with the macdonald works modern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and sandblasting over a rubber stencil leaving the letters numbers and emblems exposed on the stone the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph the stone known as black granite is usually gabbro which has a completely different chemical composition 34 buildings edit granite has been extensively used as a dimension stone and as flooring tiles in public and commercial buildings and monuments aberdeen in scotland which is constructed principally from local granite is known as the granite city because of its abundance in new england granite was commonly used to build foundations for homes there the granite railway america s first railroad was built to haul granite from the quarries in quincy massachusetts to the neponset river in the 1820s engineering edit engineers have traditionally used polished granite surface plates to establish a plane of reference since they are relatively impervious and inflexible sandblasted concrete with a heavy aggregate content has an appearance similar to rough granite and is often used as a substitute when use of real granite is impractical a most unusual use of granite was as the material of the tracks of the haytor granite tramway devon england in 1820 granite block is usually processed into slabs which can be cut and shaped by a cutting center granite tables are used extensively as bases for optical instruments because of granite s rigidity high dimensional stability and excellent vibration characteristics in military engineering finland planted granite boulders along its mannerheim line to block invasion by russian tanks in the winter war of 1940 other uses edit curling stones are traditionally fashioned of ailsa craig granite the first stones were made in the 1750s the original source being ailsa craig in scotland because of the rarity of this granite the best stones can cost as much as us 1,500 between 60 and 70 percent of the stones used today are made from ailsa craig granite although the island is now a wildlife reserve and is still used for quarrying under license for ailsa granite by kays of mauchline for curling stones 35 rock climbing edit granite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers for its steepness soundness crack systems and friction well-known venues for granite climbing include the yosemite valley the bugaboos the mont blanc massif and peaks such as the aiguille du dru the mourne mountains the adamello-presanella alps the aiguille du midi and the grandes jorasses the bregaglia corsica parts of the karakoram especially the trango towers the fitzroy massif patagonia baffin island ogawayama the cornish coast the cairngorms sugarloaf mountain in rio de janeiro brazil and the stawamus chief british columbia canada granite rock climbing is so popular that many of the artificial rock climbing walls found in gyms and theme parks are made to look and
