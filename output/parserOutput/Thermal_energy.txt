in visible light can be seen on this hot metalwork thermal energy would ideally be the amount of heat required to warm the metal to its temperature but this quantity is not well-defined as there are many ways to obtain a given body at a given temperature and each of them may require a different amount of total heat input thermal energy unlike internal energy is therefore not a state function in thermodynamics thermal energy refers to the internal energy present in a system due to its temperature 1 the concept is not well-defined or broadly accepted in physics or thermodynamics because the internal energy can be changed without changing the temperature and there is no way to distinguish which part of a system s internal energy is thermal thermal energy is sometimes used loosely as a synonym for more rigorous thermodynamic quantities such as the entire internal energy of a system or for heat or sensible heat which are defined as types of transfer of energy just as work is another type of transfer of energy heat and work depend on the way in which an energy transfer occurred whereas internal energy is a property of the state of a system and can thus be understood even without knowing how the energy got there contents 1 relation to heat and internal energy 2 historical context 3 see also 4 references 5 external links relation to heat and internal energy edit heat is energy transferred spontaneously from a hotter to a colder system or body 2 3 heat is energy in transfer not a property of the system it is not contained within the boundary of the system 2 on the other hand internal energy is a property of a system in an ideal gas the internal energy is the statistical mean of the kinetic energy of the gas particles and it is this kinetic motion that is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system boundary the internal energy of an ideal gas can in this sense be regarded as thermal energy in this case however thermal energy and internal energy are identical systems that are more complex than ideal gases such as real gases can undergo phase transitions phase transitions can change the internal energy of the system without changing its temperature therefore the thermal energy cannot be defined solely by the temperature thermal energy also cannot be defined by the difference between the internal energy and the net heat transfer in or out of the system because it is easy to construct thermodynamic cycles where the system begins and ends in exactly the same state but there is a net flow of heat in or out during the cycle these cycles can be induced upon rather small generators thus creating a rotor to spin and making electricity this is referred to as generating electricity 4 for these reasons the concept of the thermal energy of a system is ill-defined and is not used in thermodynamics historical context edit in an 1847 lecture entitled on matter living force and heat james prescott joule characterised various terms that are closely related to thermal energy and heat he identified the terms latent heat and sensible heat as forms of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles respectively 5 he described latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles i e a form of potential energy and the sensible heat as an energy affecting temperature measured by the thermometer due to the thermal energy which he called the living force see also edit heat transfer ocean thermal energy conversion thermal energy storage thermal

january 2013 i am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good that in some instances particularly in the case of sensible heat or such as is indicated by the thermometer heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced whilst in others particularly in the case of latent heat the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space external links edit retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title thermal
