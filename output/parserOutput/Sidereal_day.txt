sidereal time - wikipedia sidereal time from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from sidereal day jump to navigation search this astronomical clock uses dials showing both sidereal and solar time sidereal time sa d ri l is a timekeeping system that astronomers use to locate celestial objects using sidereal time it is possible to easily point a telescope to the proper coordinates in the night sky briefly sidereal time is a time scale that is based on earth s rate of rotation measured relative to the fixed stars 1 rather than the sun from a given observation point a star found at one location in the sky will be found at the same location on another night at the same sidereal time this is similar to how the time kept by a sundial can be used to find the location of the sun just as the sun and moon appear to rise in the east and set in the west due to the rotation of earth so do the stars both solar time and sidereal time make use of the regularity of earth s rotation about its polar axis solar time following the sun while sidereal time roughly follows the stars more exactly sidereal time is the angle measured along the celestial equator from the observer s meridian to the great circle that passes through the march equinox and both celestial poles and is usually expressed in hours minutes and seconds 2 common time on a typical clock measures a slightly longer cycle accounting not only for earth s axial rotation but also for earth s annual revolution around the sun of slightly less than 1 per day in fact to the nearest arcsecond it takes 365.2422 days to revolve therefore 360 degrees 365.2422 days 0.9856 or 59 8 per day i e slightly less than 1 degree per day a sidereal day is approximately 23 hours 56 minutes 4.0905 si seconds the vernal equinox itself precesses slowly westward relative to the fixed stars completing one revolution in about 26,000 years so the misnamed sidereal day sidereal is derived from the latin sidus meaning star is 0.0084 seconds shorter than earth s period of rotation relative to the fixed stars 3 the slightly longer true sidereal period is called a stellar day by the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers it is also referred to as the sidereal period of rotation or simply as the period of rotation or the rotational period maps of the stars in the night sky use declination and right ascension as coordinates these correspond to latitude and longitude respectively while declination is measured in degrees right ascension is measured in units of time because it was most natural to name locations in the sky in connection with the time when they crossed the meridian in the sky the meridian is the imaginary north to south line that goes through the point directly overhead the zenith the right ascension of any object crossing the meridian is equal to the current local apparent sidereal time ignoring for present purposes that part of the circumpolar region north of the north celestial pole for an observer in the northern hemisphere or south of the south celestial pole for an observer in the southern hemisphere that is crossing the meridian the other way because earth orbits the sun once a year the sidereal time at any given place and time will gain about four minutes against local civil time every 24 hours until after a year has passed one additional sidereal day

m centre only the distant star is at culmination a mean sidereal day right a few minutes later the sun is on the local meridian again a solar day is complete solar time is measured by the apparent diurnal motion of the sun and local noon in apparent solar time is the moment when the sun is exactly due south or north depending on the observer s latitude and the season a mean solar day what we normally measure as a day is the average time between local solar noons average since this varies slightly over the year earth makes one rotation around its axis in a sidereal day during that time it moves a short distance about 1 along its orbit around the sun so after a sidereal day has passed earth still needs to rotate slightly more before the sun reaches local noon according to solar time a mean solar day is therefore nearly 4 minutes longer than a sidereal day the stars are so far away that earth s movement along its orbit makes nearly no difference to their apparent direction see however parallax and so they return to their highest point in a sidereal day another way to see this difference is to notice that relative to the stars the sun appears to move around earth once per year therefore there is one fewer solar day per year than there are sidereal days this makes a sidereal day approximately 365.24 366.24 times the length of the 24-hour solar day giving approximately 23 h 56 min 4.1 s 86,164.1 s precession effects edit earth s rotation is not a simple rotation around an axis that would always remain parallel to itself earth s rotational axis itself rotates about a second axis orthogonal to earth s orbit taking about 25,800 years to perform a complete rotation this phenomenon is called the precession of the equinoxes because of this precession the stars appear to move around earth in a manner more complicated than a simple constant rotation for this reason to simplify the description of earth s orientation in astronomy and geodesy it is conventional to chart the positions of the stars in the sky according to right ascension and declination which are based on a frame that follows earth s precession and to keep track of earth s rotation through sidereal time relative to this frame as well in this reference frame earth s rotation is close to constant but the stars appear to rotate slowly with a period of about 25,800 years it is also in this reference frame that the tropical year the year related to earth s seasons represents one orbit of earth around the sun the precise definition of a sidereal day is the time taken for one rotation of earth in this precessing reference frame definition edit the local apparent sidereal time at a given location is defined as the hour angle of the vernal equinox at that location 4 it has the same value as the right ascension of any celestial body that is crossing the local meridian at that same moment at the moment when the vernal equinox crosses the local meridian local apparent sidereal time is 00 00 greenwich apparent sidereal time gast is the hour angle of the vernal equinox at the prime meridian at greenwich london local sidereal time at any location differs from the greenwich sidereal time value of the same moment by an amount that is proportional to the longitude of the location when one moves eastward 15 in longitude sidereal time is larger by one sidereal hour wrapping around at 24 hours unlike the reckoning of local solar time in time zones incrementing by usually one hour differences in local sidereal time are reckoned based on actual measured longitude to the accuracy of the measurement of the longitude not just in whole hours apparent sidereal time local or at greenwich differs from mean sidereal time for the same location and moment by the equation of the equinoxes this is a small difference in right ascension dra parallel to the equator not exceeding about 1.2 s due to nutation the complex nodding motion of earth s polar axis of rotation it corresponds to the current amount of the nutation in ecliptic longitude d and to the current obliquity of the ecliptic so that dra d cos greenwich mean sidereal time gmst and ut1 differ in rate the second of sidereal time is a little shorter than that of ut1 so that at 12 00 noon on the first day of the year 2000 7000100273790935079 1.002737909350795 s of mean sidereal time was equal to 1 s of ut1 the ratio at this second-resolution varies in the tenth decimal place over a century it is modelled to be approximately 7000100273790940979 1.002737909409795 in 2100 5 to an accuracy of 0.1 s per century greenwich mean sidereal time in hours and decimal parts of an hour can be calculated as gmst 7001186973745580000 18.697374558 7001240657098244190 24.06570982441908 d where d is the interval in ut1 days including any fraction of a day since 2000 january 1 at 12 00 ut interval counted positive if forwards to a later time than the 2000 reference instant and the result is freed from any integer multiples of 24 hours to reduce it to a value in the range 0 24 6 thus greenwich mean sidereal time exceeds mean solar time at greenwich by a difference equal to the longitude of the fictitious mean sun used for defining mean solar time with longitude converted to time as usual at the rate of 1 hour for 15 degrees plus or minus an offset of 12 hours because mean solar time is reckoned from 00 00 midnight instead of the pre-1925 astronomical tradition where 00 00 meant noon sidereal time is used at astronomical observatories because it makes it very easy to work out which astronomical objects will be observable at a given time objects are located in the night sky using right ascension and declination relative to the celestial equator analogous to longitude and latitude on earth and when sidereal time is equal to an object s right ascension the object will be at its highest point in the sky or culmination at which time it is usually best placed for observation as atmospheric extinction is minimised sidereal time is a measure of the position of the earth in its rotation around its axis or time measured by the apparent diurnal motion of the vernal equinox which is very close to the motion of stars they differ by the precession of the vernal equinox in right ascension relative to the stars earth s sidereal day also differs from its rotation period relative to the background stars by the amount of precession in right ascension during one day 8.4 ms 7 its j2000 mean value is 23 h 56 min 7000409053083300000 4.090530833 s 8 exact duration and its variation edit a mean sidereal day is about 23 h 56 min 4.1 s in length however due to variations in the rotation rate of earth the rate of an ideal sidereal clock deviates from any simple multiple of a civil clock in practice the difference is kept track of by the difference utc ut1 which is measured by radio telescopes and kept on file and available to the public at the iers and at the united states naval observatory given a tropical year of 7002365242190402000 365.242190402 days from simon et al 9 this gives a sidereal day of 7004864000000000000 86400 7002365242190402000 365.242190402 7002366242190402000 366.242190402 or 7004861640905300000 86164.09053 s aoki et al defined ut1 such that the observed sidereal day at the beginning of 2000 would be 1 7000100273790935079 1.002737909350795 times a ut1 day of 7004864000000000000 86400 s which gives 7004861640905308330 86164.090530833 s of ut1 10 for times within a century of 1984 the ratio only alters in its 11th decimal place because this is the period of rotation in a precessing reference frame it is not directly related to the mean rotation rate of earth in an inertial frame which is given by 2 t where t is the slightly longer stellar day given by aoki et al as 86 7002164098903697320 164.09890369732 s 10 this can be calculated by noting that is the magnitude of the vector sum of the rotations leading to the sidereal day and the precession of that rotation vector in fact the period of earth s rotation varies on hourly to interannual timescales by around 1 millisecond 11 together with a secular increase in length of day of about 2.3 ms per century mostly from tidal friction slowing earth s rotation 12 sidereal days compared to solar days on other planets edit of the eight solar planets all but venus and uranus have prograde rotation that is they rotate more than once per year in the same direction as they orbit the sun so the sun rises in the east 13 venus and uranus however have retrograde rotation for prograde rotation the formula relating the lengths of the sidereal and solar days is number of sidereal days per orbital period 1 number of solar days per orbital period or equivalently length of solar day length of sidereal day 1 length of sidereal day orbital period on the other hand the formula in the case of retrograde rotation is number of sidereal days per orbital period 1 number of solar days per orbital period or equivalently length of solar day length of sidereal day 1 length of sidereal day orbital period all the solar planets more distant from the sun than earth are similar to earth in that since they experience many rotations per revolution around the sun there is only a small difference between the length of the sidereal day and that of the solar day the ratio of the former to the latter never being less than earth s ratio of 0.997 but the situation is quite different for mercury and venus mercury s sidereal day is about two-thirds of its orbital period so by the prograde formula its solar day lasts for two revolutions around the sun three times as long as its sidereal day venus rotates retrograde with a sidereal day lasting about 243.0 earth days or about 1.08 times its orbital period of 224.7 earth days hence by the retrograde formula its solar day is about 116.8 earth days and it has about 1.9 solar days per orbital period by convention
