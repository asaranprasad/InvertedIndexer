limb darkening - wikipedia limb darkening from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a filtered image of the sun in visible light showing the limb-darkening effect as a dimmer luminosity towards the edge or limb of the solar disk the image was taken during the 2012 transit of venus seen here as the dark spot at the upper right limb darkening is an optical effect seen in stars including the sun where the center part of the disk appears brighter than the edge or limb of the image its understanding offered early solar astronomers an opportunity to construct models with such gradients this encouraged the development of the theory of radiative transfer basic theory edit an idealized case of limb darkening the outer boundary is the radius at which photons emitted from the star are no longer absorbed l is a distance for which the optical depth is unity high-temperature photons emitted at a will just barely escape from the star as will the low-temperature photons emitted at b note that for a typical star this drawing is not to scale e g for the sun l would be only a few hundred km crucial to understanding limb darkening is the idea of optical depth a distance equal to one optical depth is the thickness of the absorbing gas from which a fraction of 1 e photons can escape this is what defines the visible edge of a star since it is at a few optical depths that the star becomes opaque the radiation reaching us is closely approximated by the sum of all the emission along the entire line of sight up to that point where the optical depth is unity in particular if the intensity of radiation in the star varies linearly with optical depth then the radiation reaching us will be of the intensity at an optical depth of unity when we look near the edge of a star we cannot see to the same depth as when we look at the center because the line of sight must travel at an oblique angle through the stellar gas when looking near the limb in other words the star radius at which we see the optical depth as being unity increases as we move our line of sight towards the limb the second effect is the fact that the effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is usually decreasing for an increasing distance from the center of the star the radiation emitted from a gas is a strong function of temperature for a black body for example the spectrally integrated intensity is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature stefan boltzmann law since when we look at a star at first approximation the radiation comes from the point at which the optical depth is unity and that point is deeper in when looking at the center the temperature will be higher and the intensity will be greater than when we look at the limb in fact the temperature in the atmosphere of a star does not always decrease with increasing height and for certain spectral lines the optical depth is unity in a region of increasing temperature in this case we see the phenomenon of limb brightening for the sun the existence of a temperature minimum region means that limb brightening should start to dominate at far-infrared or radio wavelengths outside the lower atmosphere and well above the temperature-minimum region we find the million-kelvin solar corona for most wavelengths this region is optically thin i e has small optical depth and must therefore be limb-brightened if spherically symmetric further complication comes from the existence of rough three-dimensional structure the classical analysis of stellar limb darkening as described below assumes the existence of a smooth hydrostatic equilibrium and at some level of precision this assumption must fail most obviously in sunspots and faculae but generally everywhere instead the boundary between the chromosphere and the corona consists of a very complicated transition region best observed at ultraviolet wavelengths only detectable from space calculation of limb darkening edit limb darkening geometry the star is centered at o and has radius r the observer is at point p a distance r from the center of the star and is looking at point s on the surface of the star from the point of view of the observer s is at an angle from a line through the center of the star and the edge or limb of the star is at angle in the figure shown here as long as the observer at point p is outside the stellar atmosphere the intensity seen in the direction will be a function only of the angle of incidence this is most conveniently approximated as a polynomial in cos i i 0 k 0 n a k cos k displaystyle frac i psi i 0 sum k 0 n a k cos k psi where i is the intensity seen at p along a line of sight forming angle with respect to the stellar radius and i 0 is the central intensity in order that the ratio be unity for 0 we must have k 0 n a k 1 displaystyle sum k 0 n a k 1 for example for a lambertian radiator no limb darkening we will have all ak 0 except a0 1 as another example for the sun at 550 nm the limb darkening is well expressed by n 2 and a 0 1 a 1 a 2 0.3 displaystyle a 0 1-a 1 -a 2 0.3 a 1 0.93 displaystyle a 1 0.93 a 2 0.23 displaystyle a 2 -0.23 see cox 2000 the equation for limb darkening is sometimes more conveniently written as i i 0 1 k 1 n a k 1 cos k displaystyle frac i psi i 0 1 sum k 1 n a k 1- cos psi k which now has n independent coefficients rather than n 1 coefficients that must sum to unity the ak constants can be related to the ak constants for n 2 a 1 a 1 2 a 2 displaystyle a 1 - a 1 2 a 2 a 2 a 2 displaystyle a 2 a 2 for the sun at 550 nm we then have a 1 0.47 displaystyle a 1 -0.47 a 2 0.23 displaystyle a 2 -0.23 this model gives an intensity at the edge of the sun s disk of only 30 of the intensity at the centre of the disk we can convert these formulas to functions of by using the substitution cos cos 2 cos 2 sin 1 sin sin 2 displaystyle cos psi frac sqrt cos 2 theta - cos 2 omega sin omega sqrt 1- left frac sin theta sin omega right 2 where is the angle from the observer to the limb of the star for small we have cos 1 sin 2 displaystyle cos psi approx sqrt 1- left frac theta sin omega right 2 we see that the derivative of cos is infinite at the edge the above approximation can be used to derive an analytic expression for the ratio of the mean intensity to the central intensity the mean intensity im is the integral of the intensity over the disk of the star divided by the solid angle subtended by the disk i m i d d displaystyle i m frac int i psi d omega int d omega where d sin d d is a solid angle element and the integrals are over the disk 0 2 and 0 we may rewrite this as i m cos 1 i d cos cos 1 d cos cos 1 i d cos 1 cos displaystyle i m frac int cos omega 1 i psi d cos theta int cos omega 1 d cos theta frac int cos omega 1 i psi d cos theta 1- cos omega although this equation can be solved analytically it is rather cumbersome however for an observer at infinite distance from the star d cos displaystyle d cos theta can be replaced by sin 2 cos d cos displaystyle sin 2 omega cos psi d cos psi so we have i m 0 1 i cos d cos 0 1 cos d cos 2 0 1 i cos d cos displaystyle i m frac int 0 1 i psi cos psi d cos psi int 0 1 cos psi d cos psi 2 int 0 1 i psi cos psi d cos psi which gives i m i 0 2 k 0 n a k k 2 displaystyle frac i m i 0 2 sum k 0 n frac a k k 2 for the sun at 550 nm this says that the average intensity is 80.5 of the intensity at the centre references edit billings donald e 1966 a guide to the solar corona academic press new york cox arthur n ed 2000 allen s astrophysical quantities 14th
