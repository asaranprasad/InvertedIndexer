shadow bands - wikipedia shadow bands from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search play media shadow bands observed during the total solar eclipse of 21 august 2017 the video shows a white sheet 36 x 66 inches 0.91 x 1.7 meters laid out on the ground under the sunlight the shadow bands start faintly grow dramatically intense as the remaining crescent of sunlight shrinks and suddenly vanish at the moment of darkness of the total eclipse second contact the crowd ambiance can be heard on the audio reacting to the visual spectacle of the shadow bands and eclipse darkness shadow bands are thin wavy lines of alternating light and dark that can be seen moving and undulating in parallel on plain-coloured surfaces immediately before and after a total solar eclipse 1 they are caused by the refraction by earth s atmospheric turbulence 2 of the solar crescent as it thins to a narrow slit which increasingly collimates the light reaching earth in the minute just before and after totality 2 3 4 the shadows detailed structure is due to random patterns of fine air turbulence that refract the collimated sunlight arriving from the narrow eclipse crescent the bands rapid sliding motion is due to shifting air currents combined with the angular motion of the sun projecting through higher altitudes the degree of collimation in the light gradually increases as the crescent thins until the solar disk is completely covered and the eclipse is total stars twinkle for the same reason they are so far from earth that they appear as point sources of light easily disturbed by earth s atmospheric turbulence which acts like lenses and prisms diverting the light s path viewed toward the collimated light of a star the shadows bands from atmospheric refraction pass over the eye history edit in the 9th century ce shadow bands during a total solar eclipse were described for the first time in the v lusp part of the old icelandic poetic edda citation needed in 1820 hermann goldschmidt of germany noted shadow bands visible just before and after totality at some eclipses 5 6 7 in 1842 george b airy the english astronomer royal saw his first total eclipse of the sun he recalled shadow bands as one of the highlights as the totality approached a strange fluctuation of light was seen upon the walls and the ground so striking that in some places children ran after it and tried to catch it with their hands 8 in 2008 british astrophysicist stuart eves speculated that shadow bands might be an effect of infrasound which involves the shadow of the moon travelling at supersonic speed and inducing an atmospheric shock wave however astronomy professor barrie jones an expert on shadow bands 9 stated the accepted theory works there s no need to seek an alternative 10 references edit 2012-07-30 at archive is a b j l codona 1986 astronomy and astrophysics 164 415 27 bibcode issn retrieved 18 july 2017 jones barrie retrieved 2010-07-24 strickling wolfgang 2007-01-26 retrieved 24 july 2010 the best theory for the emergence of the shadow bands is published by codona 1986 2 his theory meanwhile accepted by the most scientists movement of the shadow bands is caused by winds in the different atmospheric levels guillermier pierre koutchmy serge 1999 total eclipses science observations myths and legends springer publishing p 151 the phenomenon of shadow bands a success of light and dark striations is somewhat random german astronomer hermann goldschmidt was the first to remark upon this complex refraction phenomenon in 1820 maunder michael j de f moore patrick 1998 eclipses general principles the sun in eclipse springer publishing p 55 shadow bands in 1820 the german astronomer hermann goldschmidt was the first to notice wavy lines seen across the earth s surface just before totality these so-called shadow bands chapter ix shadow bands memoirs 41 royal astronomical society 1857 pp 40 41 m littmann k willcox f espenak totality eclipses of the sun 2nd edition oxford university press p 119 jones barrie w shadow bands during the total solar eclipse of 26 february 1998 journal of atmospheric and solar-terrestrial physics 61 13 965 974 bibcode doi bbc news may 21 2008 retrieved 2009-11-14 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title shadow bands oldid 822414660 categories light solar eclipses hidden categories webarchive template archiveis links all articles with unsourced statements articles with unsourced statements from march 2011 navigation menu search this page was last edited on 26 january 2018 at 06 45 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
