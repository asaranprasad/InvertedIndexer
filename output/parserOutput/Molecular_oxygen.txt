allotropes of oxygen - wikipedia allotropes of oxygen from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from molecular oxygen jump to navigation search there are several known allotropes of oxygen the most familiar is molecular oxygen o2 present at significant levels in earth s atmosphere and also known as dioxygen or triplet oxygen another is the highly reactive ozone o3 others include atomic oxygen o1 a free radical singlet oxygen o2 either of two metastable states of molecular oxygen tetraoxygen o4 another metastable form solid oxygen existing in six variously colored phases of which one is o 8 and another one metallic contents 1 atomic oxygen 2 dioxygen 2.1 singlet oxygen 3 ozone 4 tetraoxygen 5 phases of solid oxygen 6 references 7 further reading atomic oxygen edit atomic oxygen denoted o 3p o 3p or o 3 p 1 is very reactive as the single atoms of oxygen tend to quickly bond with nearby molecules on earth s surface it does not exist naturally for very long but in outer space the presence of plenty of ultraviolet radiation results in a low earth orbit atmosphere in which 96 of the oxygen occurs in atomic form 1 2 atomic oxygen has been detected at planet mars by mariner viking and the sofia observatory 3 dioxygen edit the common allotrope of elemental oxygen on earth o 2 is generally known as oxygen but may be called dioxygen diatomic oxygen or molecular oxygen to distinguish it from the element itself elemental oxygen is most commonly encountered in this form as about 21 by volume of earth s atmosphere the ground state of dioxygen is known as triplet oxygen because it has two unpaired electrons the first excited state singlet oxygen has no unpaired electrons and is metastable o 2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kj mol 4 it is a colourless gas with a boiling point of 183 c 90 k 297 f 5 it can be condensed from air by cooling with liquid nitrogen which has a boiling point of 196 c 77 k 321 f liquid oxygen is pale blue in colour and is quite markedly paramagnetic liquid oxygen contained in a flask suspended by a string is attracted to a magnet singlet oxygen edit singlet oxygen is the common name used for the two metastable states of molecular oxygen o2 with higher energy than the ground state triplet oxygen because of the differences in their electron shells singlet oxygen has different chemical properties than triplet oxygen including absorbing and emitting light at different wavelengths it can be generated in a photosensitized process by energy transfer from dye molecules such as rose bengal methylene blue or porphyrins or by chemical processes such as spontaneous decomposition of hydrogen trioxide in water or the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with hypochlorite ozone edit triatomic oxygen ozone o3 is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is destructive to materials like rubber and fabrics and is also damaging to lung tissue 6 traces of it can be detected as a sharp chlorine-like smell 5 coming from electric motors laser printers and photocopiers it was named ozone by christian friedrich sch nbein in 1840 from the greek word ozo for smell 7 ozone is thermodynamically unstable toward the more common dioxygen form and is formed by reaction of o2 with atomic oxygen produced by splitting of o2 by uv radiation in the upper atmosphere 7 ozone absorbs strongly in the ultraviolet and functions as a shield for the biosphere against the mutagenic and other damaging effects of solar uv radiation see ozone layer 7 ozone is formed near the earth s surface by the photochemical disintegration of nitrogen dioxide from the exhaust of automobiles 8 ground-level ozone is an air pollutant that is especially harmful for senior citizens children and people with heart and lung conditions such as emphysema bronchitis and asthma 9 the immune system produces ozone as an antimicrobial see below 10 liquid and solid o3 have a deeper blue color than ordinary oxygen and they are unstable and explosive 7 11 ozone is a pale blue gas condensable to a dark blue liquid it is formed whenever air is subjected to an electrical discharge and has the characteristic pungent odour of new-mown hay or for those living in urban environments of subways the so-called electrical odour tetraoxygen edit tetraoxygen had been suspected to exist since the early 1900s when it was known as oxozone it was identified in 2001 by a team led by fulvio cacace at the university of rome 12 the molecule o 4 was thought to be in one of the phases of solid oxygen later identified as o 8 cacace s team suggested that o 4 probably consists of two dumbbell-like o 2 molecules loosely held together by induced dipole dispersion forces phases of solid oxygen edit there are six known distinct phases of solid oxygen one of them is a dark-red o 8 cluster when oxygen is subjected to a pressure of 96 gpa it becomes metallic in a similar manner as hydrogen 13 and becomes more similar to the heavier chalcogens such as tellurium and polonium both of which show significant metallic character at very low temperatures this phase also becomes superconducting references edit a b ryan d mcculla saint
