tesla unit - wikipedia tesla unit from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search tesla unit system si derived unit unit of magnetic field strength symbol t named after nikola tesla in si base units kg s 2 a 1 the tesla symbol t is a derived unit of magnetic flux density informally magnetic field strength in the international system of units one tesla is equal to one weber per square metre the unit was announced during the general conference on weights and measures in 1960 and is named 1 in honour of nikola tesla upon the proposal of the slovenian electrical engineer france av in the strongest fields encountered from permanent magnets are from halbach spheres and can be over 4.5 t the record pulsed magnetic field has been produced by scientists at the los alamos national laboratory campus of the national high magnetic field laboratory the world s first 100-tesla non-destructive magnetic field 2 contents 1 definition 2 electric vs magnetic field 3 conversions 4

newton s second h henry v volt j joule wb weber electric vs magnetic field edit in the production of the lorentz force the difference between electric fields and magnetic fields is that a force from a magnetic field on a charged particle is generally due to the charged particle s movement 4 while the force imparted by an electric field on a charged particle is not due to the charged particle s movement this may be appreciated by looking at the units for each the unit of electric field in the mks system of units is newtons per coulomb n c while the magnetic field in teslas can be written as n c m s the dividing factor between the two types of field is metres per second m s which is velocity this relationship immediately highlights the fact that whether a static electromagnetic field is seen as purely magnetic or purely electric or some combination of these is dependent upon one s reference frame that is one s velocity relative to the field 5 6 in ferromagnets the movement creating the magnetic field is the electron spin 7 and to a lesser extent electron orbital angular momentum in a current-carrying wire electromagnets the movement is due to electrons moving through the wire whether the wire is straight or circular conversions edit one tesla is equivalent to 8 page needed 10,000 or 10 4 g gauss used in the cgs system thus 10 kg 1 t tesla and 1 g 10 4 t 1,000,000,000 or 10
