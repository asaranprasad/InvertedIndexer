topics v t in biology and ecology extinction is the termination of an organism or of a group of organisms taxon normally a species the moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point because a species potential range may be very large determining this moment is difficult and is usually done retrospectively this difficulty leads to phenomena such as lazarus taxa where a species presumed extinct abruptly reappears typically in the fossil record after a period of apparent absence more than 99 percent of all species amounting to over five billion species 1 that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct 2 3 4 estimates on the number of earth s current species range from 10 million to 14 million 5 of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described 6 more recently in may 2016 scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described 7 through evolution species arise through the process of speciation where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition the relationship between animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established 8 a typical species becomes extinct within 10 million years of its first appearance 4 although some species called living fossils survive with virtually no morphological change for hundreds of millions of years mass extinctions are relatively rare events however isolated extinctions are quite common only recently have extinctions been recorded and scientists have become alarmed at the current high rate of extinctions 9 10 11 12 most species that become extinct are never scientifically documented some scientists estimate that up to half of presently existing plant and animal species may become extinct by 2100 13 a dagger symbol placed next to the name of a species or other taxon is often done

species is extinct when the last existing member dies extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation a species may become functionally extinct when only a handful of individuals survive which cannot reproduce due to poor health age sparse distribution over a large range a lack of individuals of both sexes in sexually reproducing species or other reasons pinpointing the extinction or pseudoextinction of a species requires a clear definition of that species if it is to be declared extinct the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species and from any other closely related species extinction of a species or replacement by a daughter species plays a key role in the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis of stephen jay gould and niles eldredge 15 skeleton of various extinct dinosaurs some other dinosaur lineages still flourish in the form of birds in ecology extinction is often used informally to refer to local extinction in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study but may still exist elsewhere this phenomenon is also known as extirpation local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations wolf reintroduction is an example of this species which are not extinct are termed extant those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as threatened or endangered species the dodo of mauritius shown here in a 1626 illustration by roelant savery is an often-cited example of modern extinction 16 currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species these are reflected by the creation of the conservation status extinct in the wild ew species listed under this status by the international union for conservation of nature iucn are not known to have any living specimens in the wild and are maintained only in zoos or other artificial environments some of these species are functionally extinct as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild 17 when possible modern zoological institutions try to maintain a viable population for species preservation and possible future reintroduction to the wild through use of carefully planned breeding programs the extinction of one species wild population can have knock-on effects causing further extinctions these are also called chains of extinction 18 this is especially common with extinction of keystone species pseudoextinction edit extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction effectively the old taxon vanishes transformed anagenesis into a successor 19 or split into more than one cladogenesis 20 pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species for example it is sometimes claimed that the extinct hyracotherium which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern horse is pseudoextinct rather than extinct because there are several extant species of equus including zebra and donkey however as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind one cannot say whether hyracotherium evolved into more modern horse species or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups lazarus taxa edit the coelacanth a fish related to lungfish and tetrapods was considered to have been extinct since the end of the cretaceous period until 1938 when a specimen was found off the chalumna river now tyolomnqa on the east coast of south africa 21 museum curator marjorie courtenay-latimer discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler captain hendrick goosen on december 23 1938 21 a local chemistry professor jlb smith confirmed the fish s importance with a famous cable most important preserve skeleton and gills fish described 21 far more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine or tasmanian tiger thylacinus cynocephalus the last known example of which died in hobart zoo in tasmania in 1936 the japanese wolf canis lupus hodophilax last sighted over 100 years ago the ivory-billed woodpecker campephilus principalis last sighted for certain in 1944 and the slender-billed curlew numenius tenuirostris not seen since 2007 22 causes edit the passenger pigeon one of hundreds of species of extinct birds was hunted to extinction over the course of a few decades as long as species have been evolving species have been going extinct it is estimated that over 99.9 of all species that ever lived are extinct the average lifespan of a species is 1 10 million years 23 although this varies widely between taxa there are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species just as each species is unique write beverly and stephen c stearns so is each extinction the causes for each are varied some subtle and complex others obvious and simple 24 most simply any species that cannot survive and reproduce in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so dies out and becomes extinct extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely as when toxic pollution renders its entire habitat unliveable or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion a phenomenon known as extinction debt assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on nature and nurture 25 the question of whether more extinctions in the fossil record have been caused by evolution or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion mark newman the author of modeling extinction argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions 4 by contrast conservation biology uses the extinction vortex model to classify extinctions by cause when concerns about human extinction have been raised for example in sir martin rees 2003 book our final hour those concerns lie with the effects of climate change or technological disaster currently environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of conservation programs 9 humans can cause extinction of a species through overharvesting pollution habitat destruction introduction of invasive species such as new predators and food competitors overhunting and other influences explosive unsustainable human population growth is an essential cause of the extinction crisis 26 according to the international union for conservation of nature iucn 784 extinctions have been recorded since the year 1500 the arbitrary date selected to define recent extinctions up to the year 2004 with many more likely to have gone unnoticed several species have also been listed as extinct since 2004 27 genetics and demographic phenomena edit if adaptation increasing population fitness is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations then a population will go extinct 28 smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation slowing adaptation it is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to fix in small populations the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause mutational meltdown limited geographic range is the most important determinant of genus extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as mass extinction arises 29 limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environmental catastrophes extinction rates can be affected not just by population size but by any factor that affects evolvability including balancing selection cryptic genetic variation phenotypic plasticity and robustness a diverse or deep gene pool gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions effects that cause or reward a loss in genetic diversity can increase the chances of extinction of a species population bottlenecks can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make inbreeding more frequent genetic pollution edit purebred wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction 30 through the process of genetic pollution i e uncontrolled hybridization introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the introduced or hybrid species 31 endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or selectively bred by people or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact extinction is likeliest for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones 32 interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids depleting the purebred gene pool for example the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the abundant domestic water buffalo such extinctions are not always apparent from morphological non-genetic observations some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionarily process nevertheless hybridization with or without introgression threatens rare species existence 33 34 the gene pool of a species or a population is the variety of genetic information in its living members a large gene pool extensive genetic diversity is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense selection meanwhile low genetic diversity see inbreeding and population bottlenecks reduces the range of adaptions possible 35 replacing native with alien genes narrows genetic diversity within the original population 32 36 thereby increasing the chance of extinction scorched land resulting from slash-and-burn agriculture habitat degradation edit habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions the main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture with urban sprawl logging mining and some fishing practices close behind the degradation of a species habitat may alter the fitness landscape to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct this may occur by direct effects such as the environment becoming toxic or indirectly by limiting a species ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly by killing all living members through contamination or sterilizing them it can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span reproductive capacity or competitiveness habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats the widespread destruction of tropical rainforests and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this 13 elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive for example a fern that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it another example is the destruction of ocean floors by bottom trawling 37 diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation global warming has allowed some species to expand their range bringing unwelcome according to whom competition to other species that previously occupied that area sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources vital resources including water and food can also be limited during habitat degradation leading to extinction the golden toad was last seen on may 15 1989 decline in amphibian populations is ongoing worldwide predation competition and disease edit in the natural course of events species become extinct for a number of reasons including but not limited to extinction of a necessary host prey or pollinator inter-species competition inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions particularly sudden changes which can act to introduce novel predators or to remove prey recently in geological time humans have become an additional cause of extinction many people would say premature extinction of some species either as a new mega-predator or by transporting animals and plants from one part of the world to another such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years sometimes intentionally e g livestock released by sailors on islands as a future source of food and sometimes accidentally e g rats escaping from boats in most cases the introductions are unsuccessful but when an invasive alien species does become established the consequences can be catastrophic invasive alien species can affect native species directly by eating them competing with them and introducing pathogens or parasites that sicken or kill them or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat human populations may themselves act as invasive predators according to the overkill hypothesis the swift extinction of the megafauna in areas such as australia 40,000 years before present north and south america 12,000 years before present madagascar hawaii 300 1000 ce and new zealand 1300 1500 ce resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques 38 coextinction edit the large haast s eagle and moa from new zealand coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another for example the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their hosts coextinction can also occur when a species loses its pollinator or to predators in a food chain who lose their prey species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems while coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions it is certainly an insidious one 39 coextinction is especially common when a keystone species goes extinct models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss there may be a cascade of coextinction across the trophic levels such effects are most severe in mutualistic and parasitic relationships an example of coextinction is the haast s eagle and the moa the haast s eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct the moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the haast s eagle 40 climate change edit extinction as a result of climate change has been confirmed by fossil studies 41 particularly the extinction of amphibians during the carboniferous rainforest collapse 305 million years ago 41 a 2003 review across 14 biodiversity research centers predicted that because of climate change 15 37 of land species would be committed to extinction by 2050 42 43 the ecologically rich areas that would potentially suffer the heaviest losses include the cape floristic region and the caribbean basin these areas might see a doubling of present carbon dioxide levels and rising temperatures that could eliminate 56,000 plant and 3,700 animal species 44 climate change has also been found to be a factor in habitat loss and desertification 45 mass extinctions edit marine extinction intensity during the phanerozoic millions of years ago h k pg tr j p tr cap late d o s the blue graph shows the apparent percentage not the absolute number of marine animal genera becoming extinct during any given time interval it does not represent all marine species just those that are readily fossilized the labels of the traditional big five extinction events and the more recently recognised end-capitanian extinction event are clickable hyperlinks see extinction event for more details source and image info there have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth and four in the last 350 million years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time a massive eruptive event is considered to be one likely cause of the permian triassic extinction event about 250 million years ago 46 which is estimated to have killed 90 of species then existing 47 there is also evidence to suggest that this event was preceded by another mass extinction known as olson s extinction 46 the cretaceous paleogene extinction event k-pg occurred 66 million years ago at the end of the cretaceous period and is best known for having wiped out non-avian dinosaurs among many other species modern extinctions edit according to a 1998 survey of 400 biologists conducted by new york s american museum of natural history nearly 70 believed that the earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction 48 known as the holocene extinction in that survey the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20 of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years by 2028 a 2014 special edition of science declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions 49 biologist e o wilson estimated 13 in 2002 that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue one-half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in 100 years 50 more significantly the current rate of global species extinctions is estimated as 100 to 1000 times background rates the average extinction rates in the evolutionary time scale of planet earth 51 52 while future rates are likely 10,000 times higher 52 however some groups are going extinct much faster biologists paul r ehrlich and stuart pimm among others contend that human population growth and overconsumption are the main drivers of the modern extinction crisis 53 54 55 56 history of scientific understanding edit dilophosaurus one of the many extinct dinosaur genera the cause of the cretaceous paleogene extinction event is a subject of much debate amongst researchers georges cuvier compared fossil mammoth jaws to those of living elephants concluding that they were distinct from any known living species 57 for much of history the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a species was incompatible with the prevailing worldview through the 18th century much of western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by god and as such was complete and perfect 58 this concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the great chain of being in which all life on earth from the tiniest microorganism to god is linked in a continuous chain 59 the extinction of a species was impossible under this model as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order 58 59 thomas jefferson was a firm supporter of the great chain of being and an opponent of extinction 58 60 famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct 61 a series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species as a result the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction in october 1686 robert hooke presented an impression of a nautilus to the royal society that was more than two feet in diameter 62 and morphologically distinct from any known living species hooke theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet 59 while he contended that it was possible a species could be lost he thought this highly unlikely 59 similarly in 1695 thomas molyneux published an account of enormous antlers found in ireland that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area 63 60 molyneux reasoned that they came from the north american moose and that the animal had once been common on the british isles 63 rather than suggest that this indicated the possibility of species going extinct he argued that although organisms could become locally extinct they could never be entirely lost and would continue to exist in some unknown region of the globe 63 using the antlers as evidence for this position molyneux described how moose had continued to exist in north america even as they were lost to the british isles 60 the antlers were later confirmed to be from the extinct irish elk megaloceros 60 hooke and molyneux s line of thinking was difficult to disprove when parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply hiding in unexplored regions of the earth 64 georges cuvier is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the french institute 61 57 though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory 65 cuvier was a well-regarded geologist lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone 57 his primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the paris basin 57 cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered 57 in 1812 cuvier along with alexandre bronigniart geoffroy saint-hilaire mapped the strata of the paris basin 59 they saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record 60 65 from these patterns cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding extinction and repopulation of the earth with new species 60 65 cuvier s fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today a fact that was accepted by most scientists 58 the primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature 65 cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time 66 his catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of uniformitarianism 66 jean-baptist lamarck a gradualist and colleague of cuvier saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species 65 while lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change 65 unlike cuvier lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible in his geological history of the earth titled hydrogeologie lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment 65 67 charles lyell a noted geologist and founder of uniformitarianism believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes like lamarck lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur noting the total extinction of the dodo and the extirpation of indigenous horses to the british isles 59 he similarly argued against mass extinctions believing that any extinction must be a gradual process 57 61 lyell also showed that cuvier s original interpretation of the parisian strata was incorrect instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by cuvier lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater deposits like those seen in the paris basin could be formed by a slow rise and fall of sea levels 60 the concept of extinction was integral to charles darwin s on the origin of species with less fit lineages disappearing over time for darwin extinction was a constant side effect of competition 68 because of the wide reach of on the origin of species it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly a concept we now refer to as background extinction 61 it was not until 1982 when david raup and jack sepkoski published their seminal paper on mass extinctions that cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism the current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by cuvier and the background extinction events proposed by lyell and darwin human attitudes and interests edit extinction is an important research topic in the field of zoology and biology in general and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community a number of organizations such as the worldwide fund for nature have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction governments have attempted through enacting laws to avoid habitat destruction agricultural over-harvesting and pollution while many human-caused extinctions have been accidental humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species such as dangerous viruses and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested other species were deliberately driven to extinction or nearly so due to poaching or because they were undesirable or to push for other human agendas one example was the near extinction of the american bison which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the united states government to force the removal of native americans many of whom relied on the bison for food 69 biologist bruce walsh of the university of arizona states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species genetic resources ecosystem stability and ethics 70 and today the scientific community stress es the importance of maintaining biodiversity 70 71 in modern times commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life however some technologies with minimal or no proven harmful effects on homo sapiens can be devastating to wildlife for example ddt 72 biogeographer jared diamond notes that while big business may label environmental concerns as exaggerated and often cause devastating damage some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by national parks 73 governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to ecotourism 74 and can enact laws with severe punishment against the trade in native species in an effort to prevent extinction in the wild nature preserves are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion the 1992 convention on biological diversity has resulted in international biodiversity action plan programmes which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation advocacy groups such as the wildlands project 75 and the alliance for zero extinctions 76 work to educate the public and pressure governments into action people who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment leaving them highly exposed to extinction risks however people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation with human overpopulation in tropical developing countries there has been enormous pressure on forests due to subsistence agriculture including slash-and-burn agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species s habitats 77 antinatalist philosopher david benatar concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs that we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal he notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction such as the loss of individual members are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction 78 planned extinction edit completed edit the smallpox virus is now extinct in the wild 79 although samples are retained in laboratory settings the rinderpest virus which infected domestic cattle is now extinct in the wild 80 proposed edit the poliovirus is now confined to small parts of the world due to extermination efforts 81 dracunculus medinensis a parasitic worm which causes the disease dracunculiasis is now close to eradication thanks to efforts led by the carter center 82 treponema pallidum pertenue a bacterium which causes the disease yaws is in the process of being eradicated biologist olivia judson has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying mosquito species in a september 25 2003 new york times article she advocated specicide of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene to create recessive knockout genes 83 she says that the anopheles mosquitoes which spread malaria and aedes mosquitoes which spread dengue fever yellow fever elephantiasis and other diseases represent only 30 species eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum at a cost of reducing the genetic diversity of the family culicidae by only 1 she further argues that since species become extinct all the time the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem we re not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species but different need not mean worse in addition anti-malarial and mosquito control programs offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in developing nations who will be infected with acute illnesses this year although trials are ongoing she writes that if they fail we should consider the ultimate swatting 83 biologist e o wilson has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito including malaria vector anopheles gambiae wilson stated i m talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them i believe it s just common sense 84 cloning edit some such as harvard geneticist george m church believe that ongoing technological advances will let us bring back to life an extinct species by cloning using dna from the remains of that species proposed targets for cloning include the mammoth the thylacine and the pyrenean ibex for this to succeed enough individuals would have to be cloned from the dna of different individuals in the case of sexually reproducing organisms to create a viable population though bioethical and philosophical objections have been raised 85 the cloning of extinct creatures seems theoretically possible 86 in 2003 scientists tried to clone the extinct pyrenean ibex c p pyrenaica this attempt failed of the 285 embryos reconstructed 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and mountain goat-domestic goat hybrids but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died 87 in 2009 a second attempt was made to clone the pyrenean ibex one clone was born alive but died seven minutes later due to physical defects in the lungs 88 see also edit bioevent empty forest gene pool genocide

978-0199549269 it is noteworthy that human concern about human extinction takes a different form from human concern where there is any about the extinction of non-human species most humans who are concerned about the extinction of non-human species are not concerned about the individual animals whose lives are cut short in the passage to extinction even though that is one of the best reasons to be concerned about extinction at least in its killing form the popular concern about animal extinction is usually concern for humans - that we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal in other words none of the typical concerns about human extinction are applied to non-human species
