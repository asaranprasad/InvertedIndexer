stellar evolution the outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous making the radius large and the surface temperature around 5,000 k 8,540 f or lower the appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red including the spectral types k and m but also class s stars and most carbon stars the most common red giants are stars on the red-giant branch rgb that are still fusing hydrogen into helium in a shell surrounding an inert helium core other red giants are the red-clump stars in the cool half of the horizontal branch fusing helium into carbon in their cores via the triple-alpha process and the asymptotic-giant-branch agb stars with a helium burning shell outside a degenerate carbon oxygen core and a hydrogen burning shell just beyond that contents 1 characteristics 2 evolution 2.1 stars

as a red giant 6 references 7 external links characteristics edit mira a variable asymptotic giant branch red giant red giants are stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and have begun thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell surrounding the core they have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the sun however their outer envelope is lower in temperature giving them a reddish-orange hue despite the lower energy density of their envelope red giants are many times more luminous than the sun because of their great size red-giant-branch stars have luminosities up to nearly three thousand times that of the sun l spectral types of k or m have surface temperatures of 3,000 4,000 k and radii up to about 200 times the sun r stars on the horizontal branch are hotter with only a small range of luminosities around 75 l asymptotic-giant-branch stars range from similar luminosities as the brighter stars of the red giant branch up to several times more luminous at the end of the thermal pulsing phase among the asymptotic-giant-branch stars belong the carbon stars of type c-n and late c-r produced when carbon and other elements are convected to the surface in what is called a dredge-up 1 the first dredge-up occurs during hydrogen shell burning on the red-giant branch but does not produce a large carbon abundance at the surface the second and sometimes third dredge up occurs during helium shell burning on the asymptotic-giant branch and convects carbon to the surface in sufficiently massive stars the stellar limb of a red giant is not sharply-defined contrary to their depiction in many illustrations rather due to the very low mass density of the envelope such stars lack a well-defined photosphere and the body of the star gradually transitions into a corona 2 the coolest red giants have complex spectra with molecular lines emission features and sometimes masers particularly from thermally pulsing agb stars 3 another noteworthy feature of red giants is that unlike sun-like stars whose photospheres have a large number of small convection cells solar granules red-giant photospheres as well as those of red supergiants have just a few large cells the features of which cause the variations of brightness so common on both types of stars 4 evolution edit this image tracks the life of a sun-like star from its birth on the left side of the frame to its evolution into a red giant on the right after billions of years red giants are evolved from main-sequence stars with masses in the range from about 0.3 m to around 8 m 5 when a star initially forms from a collapsing molecular cloud in the interstellar medium it contains primarily hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of metals in stellar structure this simply refers to any element that is not hydrogen or helium i e atomic number greater than 2 these elements are all uniformly mixed throughout the star the star reaches the main sequence when the core reaches a temperature high enough to begin fusing hydrogen a few million kelvin and establishes hydrostatic equilibrium over its main sequence life the star slowly converts the hydrogen in the core into helium its main-sequence life ends when nearly all the hydrogen in the core has been fused for the sun the main-sequence lifetime is approximately 10 billion years more-massive stars burn disproportionately faster and so have a shorter lifetime than less massive stars 6 when the star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core nuclear reactions can no longer continue and so the core begins to contract due to its own gravity this brings additional hydrogen into a zone where the temperature and pressure are adequate to cause fusion to resume in a shell around the core the outer layers of the star then expand greatly thus beginning the red-giant phase of the star s life as the star expands the energy produced in the burning shell of the star is spread over a much larger surface area resulting in a lower surface temperature and a shift in the star s visible light output towards the red hence it becomes a red giant at this time the star is said to be ascending the red-giant branch of the hertzsprung russell h r diagram 6 mira a is an old star already shedding its outer layers into space the evolutionary path the star takes as it moves along the red-giant branch that ends finally with the complete collapse of the core depends on the mass of the star for the sun and stars of less than about 2 m 7 the core will become dense enough that electron degeneracy pressure will prevent it from collapsing further once the core is degenerate it will continue to heat until it reaches a temperature of roughly 108 k hot enough to begin fusing helium to carbon via the triple-alpha process once the degenerate core reaches this temperature the entire core will begin helium fusion nearly simultaneously in a so-called helium flash in more-massive stars the collapsing core will reach 108 k before it is dense enough to be degenerate so helium fusion will begin much more smoothly and produce no helium flash 6 the core helium fusing phase of a star s life is called the horizontal branch in metal-poor stars so named because these stars lie on a nearly horizontal line in the h r diagram of many star clusters metal-rich helium-fusing stars instead lie on the so-called red clump in the h r diagram 8 an analogous process occurs when the central helium is exhausted and the star collapses once again causing helium in a shell to begin fusing at the same time hydrogen may begin fusion in a shell just outside the burning helium shell this puts the star onto the asymptotic giant branch a second red-giant phase 9 the helium fusion results in the build up of a carbon oxygen core a star below about 8 m will never start fusion in its degenerate carbon oxygen core 7 instead at the end of the asymptotic-giant-branch phase the star will eject its outer layers forming a planetary nebula with the core of the star exposed ultimately becoming a white dwarf the ejection of the outer mass and the creation of a planetary nebula finally ends the red-giant phase of the star s evolution 6 the red-giant phase typically lasts only around a billion years in total for a solar mass star almost all of which is spent on the red-giant branch the horizontal-branch and asymptotic-giant-branch phases proceed tens of times faster if the star has about 0.2 to 0.5 m 7 it is massive enough to become a red giant but does not have enough mass to initiate the fusion of helium 5 these intermediate stars cool somewhat and increase their luminosity but never achieve the tip of the red-giant branch and helium core flash when the ascent of the red-giant branch ends they puff off their outer layers much like a post-asymptotic-giant-branch star and then become a white dwarf stars that do not become red giants edit very low mass stars are fully convective 10 11 and may continue to fuse hydrogen into helium for up to a trillion years 12 until only a small fraction of the entire star is hydrogen luminosity and temperature steadily increase during this time just as for more-massive main-sequence stars but the length of time involved means that the temperature eventually increases by about 50 and the luminosity by around 10 times eventually the level of helium increases to the point where the star ceases to be fully convective and the remaining hydrogen locked in the core is consumed in only a few billion more years depending on mass the temperature and luminosity continue to increase for a time during hydrogen shell burning the star can become hotter than the sun and tens of times more luminous than when it formed although still not as luminous as the sun after some billions more years they start to become less luminous and cooler even though hydrogen shell burning continues these become cool helium white dwarfs 5 very-high-mass stars develop into supergiants that follow an evolutionary track that takes them back and forth horizontally over the hr diagram at the right end constituting red supergiants these usually end their life as a type ii supernova the most massive stars can become wolf rayet stars without becoming giants or supergiants at all 13 14 planets edit this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information april 2015 red giants with known planets the m-type hd 208527 hd 220074 and as of february 2014 a few tens 15 of known k-giants including pollux gamma cephei and iota draconis prospects for habitability edit although traditionally it has been suggested the evolution of a star into a red giant will render its planetary system if present uninhabitable some research suggests that during the evolution of a 1 m star along the red-giant branch it could harbor a habitable zone for several times 109 years at 2 au out to around 108 years at 9 au out giving perhaps enough time for life to develop on a suitable world after the red-giant stage there would for such a star be a habitable zone between 7 and 22 au for an additional 109 years 16 later studies have refined this scenario showing how for a 1 m star the habitable zone lasts from 108 years for a planet with an orbit similar to that of mars to 7015662709600000000 2.1 108 yr for one that orbits at saturn s distance to the sun the maximum time 7016116763120000000 3.7 108 yr corresponding for planets orbiting at the distance of jupiter however for planets orbiting a 0.5 m star in equivalent orbits to those of jupiter and saturn they would be in the habitable zone for 7017183034080000000 5.8 109 yr and 7016662709600000000 2.1 109 yr respectively for stars more massive than the sun the times are considerably shorter 17 enlargement of planets edit as of june 2014 50 giant planets have been discovered around giant stars however these giant planets are more massive than the giant planets found around solar-type stars this could be because giant stars are more massive than the sun less massive stars will still be on the main sequence and will not have become giants yet and more massive stars are expected to have more massive planets however the masses of the planets that have been found around giant stars do not correlate with the masses of the stars therefore the planets could be growing in mass during the stars red giant phase the growth in planet mass could be partly due to accretion from stellar wind although a much larger effect would be roche lobe overflow causing mass-transfer from the star to the planet when the giant expands out to the orbital distance of the planet 18 well known examples edit many of the well known bright stars are red giants because they are luminous and moderately common the asymptotic giant branch variable star gamma crucis is the nearest m class giant star at 88 light years 19 the k0 red giant branch star arcturus is 36 light years away 20 red-giant branch edit aldebaran tauri arcturus bootis gacrux crucis red-clump giants edit hamal arietis persei andromedae 21 asymptotic giant branch edit mira ceti cygni herculis the sun as a red giant edit the current size of the sun now in the main sequence compared to its estimated maximum size during its red-giant phase in the future in about 5 to 6 billion years the sun will have depleted the hydrogen fuel in its core and will begin to expand at its largest its surface photosphere will approximately reach the current orbit of earth it will then lose its atmosphere completely its outer layers forming a planetary nebula and the core a white dwarf the evolution of the sun into and through the red-giant phase has been extensively modelled but it remains unclear whether earth will be engulfed by the sun or will continue in orbit the uncertainty arises in part because as the sun burns hydrogen it loses mass causing earth and all planets to orbit farther away there are also significant uncertainties in calculating the orbits of the planets over the next 5 6.5 billion years so the fate of earth is not well understood at its brightest the red-giant sun will be several thousand times more luminous than today but its surface will be at about half the temperature references edit boothroyd a i sackmann i j 1999 the cno isotopes deep circulation in red giants and first
