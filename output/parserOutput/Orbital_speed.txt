p e the orbit is thus a parabola with focus at the other body see radial parabolic trajectory parabolic orbits are also open if the energy is negative k e p e 0 the orbit is closed the motion is on an ellipse with one focus at the other body see radial elliptic trajectory free-fall time planets have closed orbits around the sun transverse orbital speed edit the transverse orbital speed is inversely proportional to the distance to the central body because of the law of conservation of angular momentum or equivalently kepler s second law this states that as a body moves around its orbit during a fixed amount of time the line from the barycenter to the body sweeps a constant area of the orbital plane regardless of which part of its orbit the body traces during that period of time 1 this law implies that the body moves slower near its apoapsis than near its periapsis because at the smaller distance along the arc it needs to move faster to cover the same area mean orbital speed edit for orbits with small eccentricity the length of the orbit is close to that of a circular one and the mean orbital speed can be approximated either from observations of the orbital period and the semimajor axis of its orbit or from knowledge of the masses of the two bodies and the semimajor axis 2 v 2 a t displaystyle v approx 2 pi a over t v a displaystyle v approx sqrt mu over a where v is the orbital velocity a is the length of the semimajor axis t is the orbital period and gm is the standard gravitational parameter this is an approximation that only holds true when the orbiting body is of considerably lesser mass than the central one and eccentricity is close to zero in case one of the bodies is not of considerably lesser mass then see gravitational two-body problem so when one of the masses is almost negligible compared to the other mass as the case for earth and sun one can approximate the orbit velocity v o displaystyle v o as v o g m r displaystyle v o approx sqrt frac gm r or assuming r equal to the body s radius v o v e 2 displaystyle v o approx frac v e sqrt 2 where m is the greater mass around which this negligible mass or body is orbiting and ve is the escape velocity for an object in an eccentric orbit orbiting a much larger body the length of the orbit decreases with orbital eccentricity e and is an ellipse this can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the average orbital speed v o 2 a t 1 1 4 e 2 3 64 e 4 5 256 e 6 175 16384 e 8 displaystyle v o frac 2 pi a t left 1- frac 1 4 e 2 -
