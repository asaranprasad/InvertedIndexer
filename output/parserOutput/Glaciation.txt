glacial period - wikipedia glacial period from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from glaciation jump to navigation search a glacial period alternatively glacial or glaciation is an interval of time thousands of years within an ice age that is marked by colder temperatures and glacier advances interglacials on the other hand are periods of warmer climate between glacial periods the last glacial period ended about 15,000 years ago 1 the holocene epoch is the current interglacial a time when there are no glaciers on earth is considered a greenhouse climate state 2 3 4 look up glaciation in wiktionary the free dictionary contents 1 quaternary ice age 2 last glacial period 3 next glacial period 4 see also 5 references quaternary ice age edit glacial and interglacial cycles as represented by atmospheric co2 measured from ice core samples going back 800,000 years the stage names are part of the north american and the european alpine subdivisions the correlation between both subdivisions is tentative within the quaternary glaciation 2.6 ma to present there have been a number of glacials and interglacials last glacial period edit the last glacial period was the most recent glacial period within the current ice age occurring in the pleistocene epoch which began about 110,000 years ago and ended about 15,000 years ago 1 the glaciations that occurred during this glacial period covered many areas of the northern hemisphere and have different names depending on their geographic distributions wisconsin in north america devensian in great britain midlandian in ireland w rm in the alps weichsel in northern central europe dali in east china beiye in north china taibai in shaanxi luojishan in southwest sichuan zagunao in northwest sichuan tianchi in tianshan mountains qomolangma in himalaya and llanquihue in chile the glacial advance reached its maximum extent about 18,000 bp in europe the ice sheet reached northern germany in the last 650,000 years there were on average seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat next glacial period edit since orbital variations are predictable 5 computer models that relate orbital variations to climate can predict future climate possibilities two caveats are necessary that anthropogenic effects human-assisted global warming are likely to exert a larger influence over the short term and that the mechanism by which orbital forcing influences climate is not well understood work by berger and loutre suggests that the current warm climate may last another 50,000 years 6 see also edit climate cyclostratigraphy geologic time scale glacial history of minnesota glacier greenhouse and icehouse earth ice age interglacial and interstadial periods last glacial maximum last glacial period milankovitch cycles precession astronomy quaternary glaciation snowball earth timeline of glaciation yarkovsky effect yorp effect references edit a b j severinghaus e brook 1999 science 286 5441 930 4 doi pmid bralower t j premoli silva i malone m j 2006 leg 198 synthesis a remarkable 120-m y record of climate and oceanography from shatsky rise northwest pacific ocean check url value help proceedings of the ocean drilling program p 47 doi issn retrieved april 9 2014 christopher m fedo grant m young h wayne nesbitt 1997 precambrian research elsevier 86 3 4 201 doi miriam e katz kenneth g miller james d wright bridget s wade james v browning benjamin s cramer yair rosenthal 2008 nature geoscience nature 1 5 329 doi f varadi b runnegar m ghil 2003 pdf the astrophysical journal 592 620 630 bibcode doi archived from pdf on 2007-11-28 berger a loutre mf 2002 climate an exceptionally long interglacial ahead science 297 5585 1287 8 doi pmid retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title glacial period oldid 813562473 categories glaciology hidden categories pages with url errors pages using div col with deprecated parameters navigation menu search this page was last edited on 4 december 2017 at 02 32 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
