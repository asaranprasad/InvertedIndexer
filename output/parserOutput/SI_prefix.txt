decadic historically there have been a number of binary metric prefixes as well 1 each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol the prefix kilo- for example may be added to gram to indicate multiplication by one thousand one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams the prefix milli- likewise may be added to metre to indicate division by one thousand one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre decimal multiplicative prefixes have been a feature of all forms of the metric system with six dating back to the system s introduction in the 1790s metric prefixes have even been prepended to non-metric units the si prefixes are standardized for use in the international system of units si by the international bureau of weights and measures bipm in resolutions dating from 1960 to 1991 2 since 2009 they have formed part of the international system of quantities contents 1 list of si prefixes 2 application to units of measurement 2.1 metric units 2.1.1 mass 2.1.2 volume

prefix name has a symbol that is used in combination with the symbols for units of measure for example the symbol for kilo- is k and is used to produce km kg and kw which are the si symbols for kilometre kilogram and kilowatt respectively where greek letters are unavailable the symbol for micro is commonly replaced by u prefixes corresponding to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred hence 100 m is preferred over 1 hm hectometre or 10 dam decametres the prefixes hecto deca deci and centi are commonly used for everyday purposes and the centimetre cm is especially common however some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre because use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion 3 prefixes may not be used in combination this also applies to mass for which the si base unit kilogram already contains a prefix for example milligram mg is used instead of microkilogram kg in the arithmetic of measurements having units the units are treated as multiplicative factors to values if they have prefixes all but one of the prefixes must be expanded to their numeric multiplier except when combining values with identical units hence 6997500000000000000 5 mv 6997500000000000000 5 ma 6997500000000000000 5 10 3 v 6997500000000000000 5 10 3 a 6995249999999999999 25 10 6 v a 6995249999999999999 25 w

before the 1960 introduction of the si the prefixes including those introduced after 1960 are used with any metric unit whether officially included in the si or not e g millidynes and milligauss metric prefixes may also be used with non-metric units the choice of prefixes with a given unit is usually dictated by convenience of use unit prefixes for amounts that are much larger or smaller than those actually encountered are seldom used metric units edit mass edit in use the kilogram gram milligram microgram and smaller are fairly common however megagram and gigagram teragram etc are rarely used tonnes and kilotonnes megatonnes etc although these units generally are not used as a measure of mass per se but rather tnt energy equivalent of a mass or scientific notation are used instead megagram is occasionally used to disambiguate the metric tonne from the various non-metric tons an exception is pollution emission rates which are typically on the order of tg yr sometimes only one element or compound is denoted for an emission such as tg c yr or tg n yr alone among si units the base unit of mass the kilogram already includes a prefix the prefixes consequently do not indicate corresponding multipliers of the base unit in the case of mass for example a megagram is 7003100000000000000 1 103 kg whereas mega- indicates a multiplier of 7006100000000000000 106 volume edit the litre equal to a cubic decimetre millilitre equal to a cubic centimetre microlitre and smaller are common in europe the centilitre is often used for packaged products such as wine and the decilitre less frequently the latter two items include prefixes corresponding to an exponent that is not divisible by three larger volumes are usually denoted in kilolitres megalitres or gigalitres or else in cubic metres 1 cubic metre 1 kilolitre or cubic kilometres 1 cubic kilometre 1 teralitre for scientific purposes the cubic metre is usually used length edit the kilometre metre centimetre millimetre and smaller are common however the decimetre is rarely used the micrometre is often referred to by the non-si term micron in some fields such as chemistry the ngstr m equal to 0.1 nm historically competed with the nanometre the femtometre used mainly in particle physics is sometimes called a fermi for large scales megametre gigametre and larger are rarely used instead non-metric units are used such as astronomical units light years and parsecs the astronomical unit is mentioned in the si standards as an accepted non-si unit time and angles edit the second millisecond microsecond and shorter are common the kilosecond and megasecond also have some use though for these and longer times one usually uses either scientific notation or minutes hours and so on official policies about the use of these prefixes vary slightly between the bureau international des poids et mesures bipm and the american national institute of standards and technology nist and some of the policies of both bodies are at variance with everyday practice for instance the nist advises that to avoid confusion prefix symbols and prefixes are not used with the time-related unit symbols names min minute h hour d day nor with the angle-related symbols names degree minute and second 4 the bipm s position on the use of si prefixes with units of time larger than the second is the same as that of the nist but their position with regard to angles differs they state however astronomers use milliarcsecond which they denote mas and microarcsecond as which they use as units for measuring very small angles 5 the si unit of angle is the radian but as mentioned above degrees minutes and seconds see some scientific use temperature edit official policy also varies from common practice for the degree celsius c nist states 6 prefix symbols may be used with the unit symbol c and prefixes may be used with the unit name degree celsius for example 12 m c 12 millidegrees celsius is acceptable in practice it is more common for prefixes to be used with the kelvin when it is desirable to denote extremely large or small absolute temperatures or temperature differences thus temperatures of star interiors may be given in units of mk megakelvins and molecular cooling may be described in mk millikelvins energy edit in use the joule and kilojoule are common with larger multiples seen in limited contexts in addition the kilowatt hour a composite unit formed from the kilowatt and hour is often used for electrical energy other multiples can be formed by modifying the prefix of watt e g terawatt hour there exist a number of definitions for the non-si unit the calorie there are gram calories and kilogram calories one kilogram calorie which equals one thousand gram calories often appears capitalized and without a prefix i e cal when referring to dietary calories in food 7 it is common to apply metric prefixes to the gram calorie but not to the kilogram calorie thus 1 kcal 1000 cal 1 cal non-metric units edit metric prefixes are widely used outside the system of metric units common examples include the megabyte and the decibel metric prefixes rarely appear with imperial or us units except in some special cases e g microinch kilofoot kilopound or kip they are also used with other specialized units used in particular fields e g megaelectronvolt gigaparsec millibarn they are also occasionally used with currency units e g gigadollar mainly by people who are familiar with the prefixes from scientific usage in geology and paleontology the year with symbol a from the latin annus is commonly used with metric prefixes ka ma and ga presentation edit pronunciation edit when an si prefix is affixed to a root word the prefix carries the stress while the root drops its stress but retains a full vowel in the syllable that is stressed when the root word stands alone citation needed for example kilobyte is k l ba t with stress on the first syllable however words in common use outside the scientific community may follow idiosyncratic stress rules in english speaking countries kilometre is often pronounced k l m t r with reduced vowels on both syllables of metre the prefix giga is usually pronounced in english as with hard g as in get but sometimes d with soft g as in gin typesetting edit the latex typesetting system features an siunitx package in which the units of measurement are spelled out for example si 3 tera hertz formats as 3 thz non-standard prefixes edit distance marker on the rhine 36 xxxvi myriametres from basel the stated distance is 360 km the decimal mark in germany is a comma obsolete metric prefixes edit some of the prefixes formerly used in the metric system have fallen into disuse and were not adopted into the si 8 9 10 the decimal prefix myria- sometimes also written as myrio- ten thousand as well as the binary prefixes double- and demi- denoting a factor of 2 and 1 2 one half respectively were parts of the original metric system adopted by france in 1795 1 these were not retained when the si prefixes were internationally adopted by the 11th cgpm conference in 1960 other metric prefixes used historically include hebdo- 107 and micri- 10 14 double prefixes edit double prefixes have been used in the past such as micromillimetres or millimicrons now nanometres micromicrofarads now picofarads kilomegatons now gigatons hectokilometres now 100 kilometres and the derived adjective hectokilometric typically used for qualifying the fuel consumption measures 11 these were disallowed with the introduction of the si other obsolete double prefixes included decimilli- 10 4 which was contracted to dimi- 12 and standardized in france up to 1961 hella prefix proposal edit in 2010 uc davis student austin sendek started a petition to designate hella as the si prefix for one octillion 1027 13 the petition gathered over 60,000 supporters by circulating through facebook and receiving a significant amount of media coverage 14 although the consultative committee for units considered the proposal it was rejected however hella has been adopted by certain websites such as google calculator 15 and wolfram alpha 16 x w and v edit brian c lacki 17 follows z and y with the adopted prefixes x w and v to mean 7027100000000000000 1027 7030100000000000000 1030 and 7033099999999999999 1033 respectively thus continuing the inverse alphabetical order similar symbols and abbreviations edit in written english the symbol k is often used informally to indicate a multiple of thousand in many contexts for example one may talk of a 40k salary 40000 or call the year 2000 problem the y2k problem in these cases an uppercase k is often used with an implied unit although it could then be confused with the symbol for the kelvin temperature unit if the context is unclear this informal postfix is read or spoken as thousand or grand or just k but never kilo despite that being the origin of the letter the financial and general news media mostly use m m b b and t t as abbreviations for million billion 109 and trillion 1012 for large quantities typically currency 18 and population 19 the medical and automotive fields in the united states use the abbreviations cc or ccm for cubic centimetres 1 cubic centimetre is equivalent to 1 millilitre for nearly a century the electrical construction industry used the abbreviation mcm to designate a thousand circular mils in specifying thicknesses of large electrical cables since the mid-1990s kcmil has been adopted as the official designation of a thousand circular mils but the designation mcm still remains in wide use a similar system is used in natural gas sales in the united states m or m for thousands and mm or mm for millions of british thermal units or therms and in the oil industry 20 where mmbbl is the symbol for millions of barrels this usage of the capital letter m for thousand is from roman numerals in which m means 1,000 21 binary prefixes edit in some fields of information technology it has been common to designate non-decimal multiples based on powers of 1024 rather than 1000 for some si prefixes kilo mega giga contrary to the definitions in the international system of units si this practice has been sanctioned by some industry associations including jedec the international electrotechnical commission iec standardized the system of binary
