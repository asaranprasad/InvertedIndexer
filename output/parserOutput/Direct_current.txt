the horizontal t axis measures time and shows the zero value direct current dc is the unidirectional flow of electric charge a battery is a good example of a dc power supply direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire but can also flow through semiconductors insulators or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams the electric current flows in a constant direction distinguishing it from alternating current ac a term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current 1 the abbreviations ac and dc are often used to mean simply alternating and direct as when they modify current or voltage 2 3 direct current may be obtained from an alternating current supply by use of a rectifier which contains electronic elements usually or electromechanical elements historically that allow current to flow only in one direction direct current may be converted into alternating current with an inverter or a motor-generator set direct current is used to charge batteries and as power supply for electronic systems very large quantities of direct-current power are used in production of aluminum and other electrochemical processes it is also used for some railways especially in urban areas high-voltage direct current is used to transmit large amounts of power from remote generation sites or to interconnect alternating current power grids part of a series of articles about

in new york beginning operation in december 1880 at 133 west twenty-fifth street the high voltages it operated at allowed it to power a 2-mile 3.2 km long circuit 4 direct current was produced in 1800 by italian physicist alessandro volta s battery his voltaic pile 5 the nature of how current flowed was not understood french physicist andr -marie amp re conjectured that current travelled in one direction from positive to negative 6 when french instrument maker hippolyte pixii built the first dynamo electric generator in 1832 he found that as the magnet used passed the loops of wire each half turn it caused the flow of electricity to reverse generating an alternating current 7 at amp re s suggestion pixii later added a commutator a type of switch where contacts on the shaft work with brush contacts to produce direct current the late 1870s and early 1880s saw electricity starting to be generated at power stations these were initially set up to power arc lighting a popular type of street lighting running on very high voltage usually higher than 3000 volt direct current or alternating current 8 this was followed by the wide spread use of low voltage direct current for indoor electric lighting in business and homes after inventor thomas edison launched his incandescent bulb based electric utility in 1882 because of the significant advantages of alternating current over direct current in using transformers to raise and lower voltages to allow much longer transmission distances direct current was replaced over the next few decades by alternating current in power delivery in the mid-1950s high-voltage direct current transmission was developed and is now an option instead of long-distance high voltage alternating current systems for long distance underseas cables e g between countries such as norned this dc option is the only technically feasible option for applications requiring direct current such as third rail power systems alternating current is distributed to a substation which utilizes a rectifier to convert the power to direct current various definitions edit types of direct current the term dc is used to refer to power systems that use only one polarity of voltage or current and to refer to the constant zero-frequency or slowly varying local mean value of a voltage or current 9 for example the voltage across a dc voltage source is constant as is the current through a dc current source the dc solution of an electric circuit is the solution where all voltages and currents are constant it can be shown that any stationary voltage or current waveform can be decomposed into a sum of a dc component and a zero-mean time-varying component the dc component is defined to be the expected value or the average value of the voltage or current over all time although dc stands for direct current dc often refers to constant polarity under this definition dc voltages can vary in time as seen in the raw output of a rectifier or the fluctuating voice signal on a telephone line some forms of dc such as that produced by a voltage regulator have almost no variations in voltage but may still have variations in output power and current circuits edit a direct current circuit is an electrical circuit that consists of any combination of constant voltage sources constant current sources and resistors in this case the circuit voltages and currents are independent of time a particular circuit voltage or current does not depend on the past value of any circuit voltage or current this implies that the system of equations that represent a dc circuit do not involve integrals or derivatives with respect to time if a capacitor or inductor is added to a dc circuit the resulting circuit is not strictly speaking a dc circuit however most such circuits have a dc solution this solution gives the circuit voltages and currents when the circuit is in dc steady state such a circuit is represented by a system of differential equations the solution to these equations usually contain a time varying or transient part as well as constant or steady state part it is this steady state part that is the dc solution there are some circuits that do not have a dc solution two simple examples are a constant current source connected to a capacitor and a constant voltage source connected to an inductor in electronics it is common to refer to a circuit that is powered by a dc voltage source such as a battery or the output of a dc power supply as a dc circuit even though what is meant is that the circuit is dc powered applications edit this section needs expansion with more examples and additional citations see also introduction you can help by october 2015 domestic edit this symbol which can be represented with unicode character u 2393 is found on many electronic devices that either require or produce direct current dc is commonly found in many extra-low voltage applications and some low-voltage applications especially where these are powered by batteries or solar power systems since both can produce only dc most electronic circuits require a dc power supply domestic dc installations usually have different types of sockets connectors switches and fixtures from those suitable for alternating current this is mostly due to the lower voltages used resulting in higher currents to produce the same amount of power it is usually important with a dc appliance to observe polarity unless the device has a diode bridge to correct for this automotive edit most automotive applications use dc the alternator is an ac device which uses a rectifier to produce dc usually 12 v dc are used but a few have a 6 v e g classic vw beetle or a 42 v electrical system telecommunication edit through the use of a dc-dc converter higher dc voltages such as 48 v to 72 v dc can be stepped down to 36 v 24 v 18 v 12 v or 5 v to supply different loads in a telecommunications system operating at 48 v dc it is generally more efficient to step voltage down to 12 v to 24 v dc with a dc-dc converter and power equipment loads directly at their native dc input voltages versus operating a 48 v dc to 120 v ac inverter to provide power to equipment many telephones connect to a twisted pair of wires and use a bias tee to internally separate the ac component of the voltage between the two wires the audio signal from the dc component of the voltage between the two wires used to power the phone telephone exchange communication equipment such as dslams uses standard 48 v dc power supply the negative polarity is achieved by grounding the positive terminal of power supply system and the battery bank this is done to prevent electrolysis depositions high-voltage power transmission edit high-voltage direct current hvdc electric power transmission systems use dc for the bulk transmission of electrical power in contrast with the more common alternating current systems for long-distance transmission hvdc systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses other edit applications using fuel cells mixing hydrogen and oxygen together with a catalyst to produce electricity and water as byproducts also produce only dc light aircraft electrical systems are typically 12 v or 20 v dc see also edit alternating current dc bias electric current high-voltage direct current power transmission neutral direct-current telegraph system
