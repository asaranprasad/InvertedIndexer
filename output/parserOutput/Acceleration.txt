acceleration wikipedia acceleration acceleration in physics is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time an object s acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting on the object as described by newton s second law 1 the si unit for acceleration is metre per second squared m s 2 accelerations are vector quantities they have magnitude and direction and add according to the parallelogram law 2 3 as a vector the calculated net force is equal to the product of the object s mass a scalar quantity and its acceleration for example when a car starts from a standstill zero relative velocity and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds it is accelerating in the direction of travel if the car turns an acceleration occurs toward the new direction in this example we can call the forward acceleration of the car a linear acceleration which passengers in the car might experience as a force pushing them back into their seats when changing direction we might call this non-linear acceleration which passengers might experience as a sideways force if the speed of the car decreases this is an acceleration in the opposite direction from the direction of the vehicle sometimes called deceleration 4 passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them forwards mathematically there is no separate formula for deceleration both are changes in velocity each of these accelerations linear non-linear deceleration might be felt by passengers until their velocity speed and direction matches that of the car definition and properties kinematic quantities of a classical particle mass m position r velocity v acceleration a average acceleration acceleration is the rate of change of velocity at any point on a trajectory the magnitude of the acceleration is given by the rate of change of velocity in both magnitude and direction at that point the true acceleration at time t is found in the limit as time interval t 0 of v t an object s

metre per second per second as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value every second other forms an object moving in a circular motion such as a satellite orbiting the earth is accelerating due to the change of direction of motion although its speed may be constant in this case it is said to be undergoing centripetal directed towards the center acceleration proper acceleration the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition is measured by an instrument called an accelerometer in classical mechanics for a body with constant mass the vector acceleration of the body s center of mass is proportional to the net force vector i e sum of all forces acting on it newton s second law f m a a f m displaystyle mathbf f m mathbf a quad to quad mathbf a mathbf f m where f is the net force acting on the body m is the mass of the body and a is the center-of-mass acceleration as speeds approach the speed of light relativistic effects become increasingly large tangential and centripetal acceleration an oscillating pendulum with velocity and acceleration marked it experiences both tangential and centripetal acceleration components of acceleration for a curved motion the tangential component a t is due to the change in speed of traversal and points along the curve in the direction of the velocity vector or in the opposite direction the normal component also called centripetal component for circular motion ac is due to the change in direction of the velocity vector and is normal to the trajectory pointing toward the center of curvature of the path the velocity of a particle moving on a curved path as a function of time can be written as v t v t v t v t v t u t t displaystyle mathbf v t v t frac mathbf v t v t v t mathbf u

vector to the particle s trajectory also called the principal normal and r is its instantaneous radius of curvature based upon the osculating circle at time t these components are called the tangential acceleration and the normal or radial acceleration or centripetal acceleration in circular motion see also circular motion and centripetal force geometrical analysis of three-dimensional space curves which explains tangent principal normal and binormal is described by the frenet serret formulas 6 7 special cases uniform acceleration calculation of the speed difference for a uniform acceleration uniform or constant acceleration is a type of motion in which the velocity of an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period a frequently cited example of uniform acceleration is that of an object in free fall in a uniform gravitational field the acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the gravitational field strength g also called acceleration due to gravity by newton s second law the force f acting on a body is given by f m g displaystyle mathbf f m mathbf g because of the simple analytic properties of

displaystyle mathbf a is the uniform rate of acceleration in particular the motion can be resolved into two orthogonal parts one of constant velocity and the other according to the above equations as galileo showed the net result is parabolic motion which describes e g the trajectory of a projectile in a vacuum near the surface of earth 9 circular motion position vector r always points radially from the origin velocity vector v always tangent to the path of motion acceleration vector a not parallel to the radial motion but offset by the angular and coriolis accelerations nor tangent to the path but offset by the centripetal and radial accelerations kinematic vectors in plane polar coordinates notice the setup is not restricted to 2d space but a plane in any higher dimension uniform circular motion that is constant speed along a circular path is an example of a body experiencing acceleration resulting in velocity of a constant magnitude but change of direction in this case because the direction of the object s motion is constantly changing being tangential to the circle the object s linear velocity vector also changes but its speed does not this acceleration is a radial acceleration since it is always directed toward the centre of the circle and takes the magnitude a v 2 r displaystyle textrm a v 2 over r where v displaystyle v is the object s linear speed along the circular path equivalently the radial acceleration vector a displaystyle mathbf a may be calculated from the object s angular velocity displaystyle omega a 2 r displaystyle mathbf a omega 2 mathbf r where r displaystyle mathbf r is a vector directed from the centre of the circle and equal in magnitude to the radius the negative shows that the acceleration vector is directed towards the centre of the circle opposite to the radius the acceleration and the net force acting on a body in uniform circular motion are directed toward the centre of the circle that is it is centripetal whereas the so-called centrifugal force appearing to act outward on the body is really a pseudo force experienced in the frame of reference of the body in circular motion due to the body s linear momentum at a tangent to the circle with nonuniform circular motion i e the speed along the curved path changes a transverse acceleration is produced equal to the rate of change of the angular speed around the circle times the radius of the circle that is a r displaystyle a r alpha the transverse or tangential acceleration is directed at right angles to the radius vector and takes the sign of the angular acceleration displaystyle alpha relation to relativity special relativity the special theory of relativity describes the behavior of objects traveling relative to other objects at speeds approaching that of light in a vacuum newtonian mechanics is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality valid to great accuracy at lower speeds as the relevant speeds increase toward the speed of light acceleration no longer follows classical equations as speeds approach that of light the acceleration produced by a given force decreases becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached an object with mass can approach this speed asymptotically but never reach it general relativity unless the state of motion of an object is known it is impossible to distinguish whether an observed force is due to gravity or to acceleration gravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects albert einstein called this the principle of equivalence and said that only observers who feel no force at all including the force of gravity are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating 10 conversions inertia four-vector making the connection between space and time explicit gravitational
