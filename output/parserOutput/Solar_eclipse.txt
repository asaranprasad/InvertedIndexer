solar eclipse - wikipedia solar eclipse from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon completely covers the sun s disk as seen in this 1999 solar eclipse solar prominences can be seen along the limb in red as well as extensive coronal filaments an annular solar eclipse left occurs when the moon is too far away to completely cover the sun s disk may 20 2012 during a partial solar eclipse right the moon blocks only part of the sun s disk october 23 2014 a solar eclipse as seen from the planet earth is a type of eclipse that occurs when the moon passes between the sun and earth and when the moon fully or partially blocks occults the sun this can happen only at new moon when the sun and the moon are in conjunction as seen from earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy in a total eclipse the disk of the sun is fully obscured by the moon in partial and annular eclipses only part of the sun is obscured if the moon were in a perfectly circular orbit a little closer to the earth and in the same orbital plane there would be total solar eclipses every new moon however since the moon s orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the earth s orbit around the sun its shadow usually misses earth the moon s orbit must cross earth s ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse both solar as well as lunar to occur in addition the moon s actual orbit is elliptical often taking it far enough away from earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the sun entirely the orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two and up to five solar eclipses occurring each year no more than two of which can be total eclipses 1 2 however total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the earth s surface traced by the moon s shadow or umbra an eclipse is a natural phenomenon however in some ancient and modern cultures solar eclipses were attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens a total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who are unaware of its astronomical explanation as the sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes since looking directly at the sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse it is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection however this is a dangerous practice as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location people referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses 3 4 contents 1 types 1.1 terminology for central eclipse 2 predictions 2.1 geometry 2.2 path 2.3

occur when the sun has a larger apparent size than the moon whereas a total eclipse can occur when the moon has a larger apparent size partial solar eclipse during annular solar eclipse of may 20 2012 there are four types of solar eclipses a total eclipse occurs when the dark silhouette of the moon completely obscures the intensely bright light of the sun allowing the much fainter solar corona to be visible during any one eclipse totality occurs at best only in a narrow track on the surface of earth 5 this narrow track is called the path of totality 6 an annular eclipse occurs when the sun and moon are exactly in line with the earth but the apparent size of the moon is smaller than that of the sun hence the sun appears as a very bright ring or annulus surrounding the dark disk of the moon 7 a hybrid eclipse also called annular total eclipse shifts between a total and annular eclipse at certain points on the surface of earth it appears as a total eclipse whereas at other points it appears as annular hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare 7 a partial eclipse occurs when the sun and moon are not exactly in line with the earth and the moon only partially obscures the sun this phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of the earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse however some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse because the umbra passes above the earth s polar regions and never intersects the earth s surface 7 partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun s brightness as it takes well over 90 coverage to notice any darkening at all even at 99 it would be no darker than civil twilight 8 of course partial eclipses and partial stages of other eclipses can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter which should always be used for safety the sun s distance from earth is about 400 times the moon s distance and the sun s diameter is about 400 times the moon s diameter because these ratios are approximately the same the sun and the moon as seen from earth appear to be approximately the same size about 0.5 degree of arc in angular measure 7 a separate category of solar eclipses is that of the sun being occluded by a body other than the earth s moon as can be observed at points in space away from the earth s surface two examples are when the crew of apollo 12 observed the earth eclipse the sun in 1969 and when the cassini probe observed saturn eclipsing the sun in 2006 the moon s orbit around the earth is slightly elliptical as is the earth s orbit around the sun the apparent sizes of the sun and moon therefore vary 9 the magnitude of an eclipse is the ratio of the apparent size of the moon to the apparent size of the sun during an eclipse an eclipse that occurs when the moon is near its closest distance to earth i e near its perigee can be a total eclipse because the moon will appear to be large enough to completely cover the sun s bright disk or photosphere a total eclipse has a magnitude greater than or equal to 1.000 conversely an eclipse that occurs when the moon is near its farthest distance from earth i e near its apogee can only be an annular eclipse because the moon will appear to be slightly smaller than the sun the magnitude of an annular eclipse is less than 1 slightly more solar eclipses are annular than total because on average the moon lies too far from earth to cover the sun completely a hybrid eclipse occurs when the magnitude of an eclipse changes during the event from less to greater than one so the eclipse appears to be total at locations nearer the midpoint and annular at other locations nearer the beginning and end since the sides of the earth are slightly further away from the moon these eclipses are extremely narrow in their path width and extremely short in their duration at any point at most just a few seconds at any location within just a few kilometres of the centerline of the path like a focal point the width and duration of totality and annularity are near zero at the points where the changes between the two occur 10 because the earth s orbit around the sun is also elliptical the earth s distance from the sun similarly varies throughout the year this affects the apparent size of the sun in the same way but not as much as does the moon s varying distance from earth 7 when earth approaches its farthest distance from the sun in early july a total eclipse is somewhat more likely whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when earth approaches its closest distance to the sun in early january 11 terminology for central eclipse each icon shows the view from the centre of its black spot representing the moon not to scale central eclipse is often used as a generic term for a total annular or hybrid eclipse 12 this is however not completely correct the definition of a central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the earth s surface it is possible though extremely rare that part of the umbra intersects with the earth thus creating an annular or total eclipse but not its central line this is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse 12 the last umbral yet non-central solar eclipse was on april 29 2014 this was an annular eclipse the next non-central total solar eclipse will be on april 9 2043 13 diamond ring effect at third contact marking the end of totality some prominences can also be seen the phases observed during a total eclipse are called 14 first contact when the moon s limb edge is exactly tangential to the sun s limb second contact starting with baily s beads caused by light shining through valleys on the moon s surface and the diamond ring effect almost the entire disk is covered totality the moon obscures the entire disk of the sun and only the solar corona is visible third contact when the first bright light becomes visible and the moon s shadow is moving away from the observer again a diamond ring may be observed fourth contact when the trailing edge of the moon ceases to overlap with the solar disk and the eclipse ends predictions geometry geometry of a total solar eclipse not to scale the diagrams to the right show the alignment of the sun moon and earth during a solar eclipse the dark gray region between the moon and earth is the umbra where the sun is completely obscured by the moon the small area where the umbra touches earth s surface is where a total eclipse can be seen the larger light gray area is the penumbra in which a partial eclipse can be seen an observer in the antumbra the area of shadow beyond the umbra will see an annular eclipse 15 the moon s orbit around the earth is inclined at an angle of just over 5 degrees to the plane of the earth s orbit around the sun the ecliptic because of this at the time of a new moon the moon will usually pass to the north or south of the sun a solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points known as nodes where the moon s orbit crosses the ecliptic 16 as noted above the moon s orbit is also elliptical the moon s distance from the earth can vary by about 6 from its average value therefore the moon s apparent size varies with its distance from the earth and it is this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses the distance of the earth from the sun also varies during the year but this is a smaller effect on average the moon appears to be slightly smaller than the sun as seen from the earth so the majority about 60 of central eclipses are annular it is only when the moon is closer to the earth than average near its perigee that a total eclipse occurs 17 18 moon sun at perigee nearest at apogee farthest at perihelion nearest at aphelion farthest mean radius

this is known as the sidereal month however during one sidereal month earth has revolved part way around the sun making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal month it is approximately 29.5 days this is known as the synodic month and corresponds to what is commonly called the lunar month 16 the moon crosses from south to north of the ecliptic at its ascending node and vice versa at its descending node 16 however the nodes of the moon s orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion due to the action of the sun s gravity on the moon s motion and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years this regression means that the time between each passage of the moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month this period is called the nodical or draconic month 20 finally the moon s perigee is moving forwards or precessing in its orbit and makes a complete circuit in 8.85 years the time between one perigee and the next is slightly longer than the sidereal month and known as the anomalistic month 21 the moon s orbit intersects with the ecliptic at the two nodes that are 180 degrees apart therefore the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months 173.3 days apart known as eclipse seasons and there will always be at least one solar eclipse during these periods sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses this means that in any given year there will always be at least two solar eclipses and there can be as many as five 22 eclipses can occur only when the sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node 10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses this is referred to as an eclipse limit in the time it takes for the moon to return to a node draconic month the apparent position of the sun has moved about 29 degrees relative to the nodes 1 since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees 24 degrees for central eclipses it is possible for partial eclipses or rarely a partial and a central eclipse to occur in consecutive months 23 24 fraction of the sun s disc covered f when the same-sized discs are offset a fraction t of their diameter 25 path during a central eclipse the moon s umbra or antumbra in the case of an annular eclipse moves rapidly from west to east across the earth the earth is also rotating from west to east at about 28 km min at the equator but as the moon is moving in the same direction as the earth s spin at about 61 km min the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the earth at the speed of the moon s orbital velocity minus the earth s rotational velocity 26 the width of the track of a central eclipse varies according to the relative apparent diameters of the sun and moon in the most favourable circumstances when a total eclipse occurs very close to perigee the track can be up to 267 km 166 mi wide and the duration of totality may be over 7 minutes 27 outside of the central track a partial eclipse is seen over a much larger area of the earth typically the umbra is 100 160 km wide while the penumbral diameter is in excess of 6400 km 28 duration the following factors determine the duration of a total solar eclipse in order of decreasing importance 29 30 the moon being almost exactly at perigee making its angular diameter as large as possible the earth being very near aphelion furthest away from the sun in its elliptical orbit making its angular diameter nearly as small as possible the midpoint of the eclipse being very close to the earth s equator where the rotational velocity is greatest the vector of the eclipse path at the midpoint of the eclipse aligning with the vector of the earth s rotation i e not diagonal but due east the midpoint of the eclipse being near the subsolar point the part of the earth closest to the sun the longest eclipse that has been calculated thus far is the eclipse of july 16 2186 with a maximum duration of 7 minutes 4 seconds over northern guyana occurrence and cycles total solar eclipse paths 1001 2000 showing that total solar eclipses occur almost everywhere on earth this image was merged from 50 separate images from nasa 31 total solar eclipses are rare events although they occur somewhere on earth every 18 months on average 32 it is estimated that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years on average 33 the total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location because the moon s umbra moves eastward at over 1700 km h 34 totality currently can never last more than 7 min 32 s this value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing by the 8th millennium the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7 min 2 s 29 the last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was june 30 1973 7 min 3 sec observers aboard a concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the moon s umbra 35 the next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until june 25 2150 the longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 bc to at least 8000 ad will occur on july 16 2186 when totality will last 7 min 29 s 29 36 for comparison the longest total eclipse of the 20th century at 7 min 8 s occurred on june 20 1955 and there are no total solar eclipses over 7 min in duration in the 21st century 37 if the date and time of any solar eclipse are known it is possible to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles the saros is probably the best known and one of the most accurate a saros lasts 6,585.3 days a little over 18 years which means that after this period a practically identical eclipse will occur the most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120 in longitude due to the 0.3 days and a little in latitude north-south for odd-numbered cycles the reverse for even-numbered ones a saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of earth s polar regions then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region a saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses with about 40 to 60 of them being central 38 frequency per year between two and five solar eclipses occur every year with at least one per eclipse season since the gregorian calendar was instituted in 1582 years that have had five solar eclipses were 1693 1758 1805 1823 1870 and 1935 the next occurrence will be 2206 39 on average there are about 240 solar eclipses each century 40 the 5 solar eclipses of 1935 january 5 february 3 june 30 july 30 december 25 partial south partial north partial north partial south annular south saros 111 saros 149 saros 116 saros 154 saros 121 final totality total solar eclipses are seen on earth because of a fortuitous combination of circumstances even on earth the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary on a geological time scale phenomenon hundreds of millions of years in the past the moon was closer to the earth and therefore apparently larger so every solar eclipse was total or partial and there were no annular eclipses due to tidal acceleration the orbit of the moon around the earth becomes approximately 3.8 cm more distant each year millions of years in the future the moon will be too far away to fully occlude the sun and no total eclipses will occur in the same timeframe the sun may become brighter making it appear larger in size 41 estimates of the when the moon will be unable to occlude the entire sun when viewed from the earth range between 1.4 billion 41 and 650 million years in the future 42 historical eclipses astronomers studying an eclipse painted by antoine caron in 1571 historical eclipses are a very valuable resource for historians in that they allow a few historical events to be dated precisely from which other dates and ancient calendars may be deduced a solar eclipse of june 15 763 bc mentioned in an assyrian text is important for the chronology of the ancient near east 43 there have been other claims to date earlier eclipses the book of joshua 10 13 could refer to an annular eclipse on 30 october 1207 bc 44 the king zhong kang supposedly beheaded two astronomers hsi and ho who failed to predict an eclipse 4,000 years ago 45 perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist bruce masse who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on may 10 2807 bc with a possible meteor impact in the indian ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse 46 eclipses have been interpreted as omens or portents 47 the ancient greek historian herodotus wrote that thales of miletus predicted an eclipse that occurred during a battle between the medes and the lydians both sides put down their weapons and declared peace as a result of the eclipse 48 the exact eclipse involved remains uncertain although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities one likely candidate took place on may 28 585 bc probably near the halys river in asia minor 49 an eclipse recorded by herodotus before xerxes departed for his expedition against greece 50 which is traditionally dated to 480 bc was matched by john russell hind to an annular eclipse of the sun at sardis on february 17 478 bc 51 alternatively a partial eclipse was visible from persia on october 2 480 bc 52 herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at sparta during the second persian invasion of greece 53 the date of the eclipse august 1 477 bc does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians 54 chinese records of eclipses begin at around 720 bc 55 the 4th century bc astronomer shi shen described the prediction of eclipses by using the relative positions of the moon and sun 56 the radiating influence theory i e the moon s light was reflection from the sun was existent in chinese thought from about the sixth century bc in the zhi ran of zhi ni zi 57 though it was opposed by the 1st century ad philosopher wang chong who made clear in his writing that this theory was nothing new 56 ancient greeks such as parmenides and aristotle also supported the theory of the moon shining because of reflected light 57 attempts have been made to establish the exact date of good friday by assuming that the darkness described at jesus s crucifixion was a solar eclipse this research has not yielded conclusive results 58 59 and good friday is recorded as being at passover which is held at the time of a full moon further the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth or three hours which is much much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse s totality in the western hemisphere there are few reliable records of eclipses before 800 ad until the advent of arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period 55 the first recorded observation of the corona was made in constantinople in 968 ad 52 55 the first known telescopic observation of a total solar eclipse was made in france in 1706 55 nine years later english astronomer edmund halley accurately predicted and observed the solar eclipse of may 3 1715 52 55 by the mid-19th century scientific understanding of the sun was improving through observations of the sun s corona during solar eclipses the corona was identified as part of the sun s atmosphere in 1842 and the first photograph or daguerreotype of a total eclipse was taken of the solar eclipse of july 28 1851 52 spectroscope observations were made of the solar eclipse of august 18 1868 which helped to determine the chemical composition of the sun 52 illustration from de magna eclipsi solari quae continget anno 1764 published in acta eruditorum 1762 john fiske summed up myths about the solar eclipse like this in his 1872 book myth and myth-makers the myth of hercules and cacus the fundamental idea is the victory of the solar god over the robber who steals the light now whether the robber carries off the light in the evening when indra has gone to sleep or boldly rears his black form against the sky during the daytime causing darkness to spread over the earth would make little difference to the framers of the myth to a chicken a solar eclipse is the same thing as nightfall and he goes to roost accordingly why then should the primitive thinker have made a distinction between the darkening of the sky caused by black clouds and that caused by the rotation of the earth he had no more conception of the scientific explanation of these phenomena than the chicken has of the scientific explanation of an eclipse for him it was enough to know that the solar radiance was stolen in the one case as in the other and to suspect that the same demon was to blame for both robberies 60 viewing looking directly at the photosphere of the sun the bright disk of the sun itself even for just a few seconds can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits this damage can result in impairment of vision up to and including blindness the retina has no sensitivity to pain and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours so there is no warning that injury is occurring 61 62 under normal conditions the sun is so bright that it is difficult to stare at it directly however during an eclipse with so much of the sun covered it is easier and more tempting to stare at it looking at the sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse except during the brief period of totality when the sun s disk is completely covered totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse viewing the sun s disk through any kind of optical aid binoculars a telescope or even an optical camera viewfinder is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second 63 64 partial and annular eclipses eclipse glasses pinhole projection method of observing partial solar eclipse insert upper left partially eclipsed sun photographed with a white solar filter main image projections of the partially eclipsed sun bottom right viewing the sun during partial and annular eclipses and during total eclipses outside the brief period of totality requires special eye protection or indirect viewing methods if eye damage is to be avoided the sun s disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the sun s radiation sunglasses do not make viewing the sun safe only properly designed and certified solar filters should be used for direct viewing of the sun s disk 65 especially self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case a compact disc a black colour slide film smoked glass etc must be avoided 66 67 the safest way to view the sun s disk is by indirect projection 68 this can be done by projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars with one of the lenses covered a telescope or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it about 1 mm diameter often called a pinhole camera the projected image of the sun can then be safely viewed this technique can be used to observe sunspots as well as eclipses care must be taken however to ensure that no one looks through the projector telescope pinhole etc directly 69 viewing the sun s disk on a video display screen provided by a video camera or digital camera is safe although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the sun the optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe securely mounting 14 welder s glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible 67 professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have in the partial eclipse path one will not be able to see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky however depending on how much of the sun s disk is obscured some darkening may be noticeable if three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim as if the sky were overcast yet objects still cast sharp shadows 70 totality baily s beads when the shrinking visible part of the photosphere becomes very small baily s beads will occur these are caused by the sunlight still being able to reach the earth through lunar valleys totality then begins with the diamond ring effect the last bright flash of sunlight 71 it is safe to observe the total phase of a solar eclipse directly only when the sun s photosphere is completely covered by the moon and not before or after totality 68 during this period the sun is too dim to be seen through filters the sun s faint corona will be visible and the chromosphere solar prominences and possibly even a solar flare may be seen at the end of totality the same effects will occur in reverse order and on the opposite side of the moon 71 photography the progression of a solar eclipse on august 1 2008 in novosibirsk russia all times utc local time was utc 7 the time span between shots is three minutes photographing an eclipse is possible with fairly common camera equipment in order for the disk of the sun moon to be easily visible a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed at least 200 mm for a 35 mm camera and for the disk to fill most of the frame a longer lens is needed over 500 mm as with viewing the sun directly looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina so care is recommended 72 solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used using a camera s live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye but the sun s rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter 73 eclipse chasing a decidated group of eclipse chasers have pursued the observation of solar eclipses when they occur around the earth 74 a person who chases eclipses is known as an umbraphile meaning shadow lover 75 umbraphiles travel for eclipses and use various tools to help view the sun including solar viewing glasses also known as eclipse glasses as well as telescopes 76 77 other observations a total solar eclipse provides a rare opportunity to observe the corona the outer layer of the sun s atmosphere normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona according to the point reached in the solar cycle the corona may appear small and symmetric or large and fuzzy it is very hard to predict this in advance 78 as the light filters through leaves of trees during a partial eclipse the overlapping leaves create natural pinholes displaying mini eclipses on the ground 79 phenomena associated with eclipses include shadow bands also known as flying shadows which are similar to shadows on the bottom of a swimming pool they only occur just prior to and after totality when a narrow solar crescent acts as an anisotropic light source 80 1919 observations eddington s original photograph of the 1919 eclipse which provided evidence for einstein s theory of general relativity the observation of a total solar eclipse of may 29 1919 helped to confirm einstein s theory of general relativity by comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation taurus with and without the sun between them arthur eddington stated that the theoretical predictions about gravitational lenses were confirmed 81 the observation with the sun between the stars was only possible during totality since the stars are then visible though eddington s observations were near the experimental limits of accuracy at the time work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results 82 83 gravity anomalies there is a long history of observations of gravity-related phenomena during solar eclipses especially during the period of totality in 1954 and again in 1959 maurice allais reported observations of strange and unexplained movement during solar eclipses 84 the reality of this phenomenon named the allais effect has remained controversial similarly in 1970 saxl and allen observed the sudden change in motion of a torsion pendulum this phenomenon is called the saxl effect 85 a recent published observation during the 1997 solar eclipse by wang et al suggested a possible gravitational shielding effect 86 which generated debate later in 2002 yang and wang published detailed data analysis which suggested that the phenomenon still remains unexplained 87 eclipses and transits in principle the simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of a planet is possible but these events are extremely rare because of their short durations the next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of mercury will be on july 5 6757 and a solar eclipse and a transit of venus is expected on april 5 15232 88 more common but still infrequent is a conjunction of a planet especially but not only mercury or venus at the time of a total solar eclipse in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed sun when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the sun s glare at one time some scientists hypothesized that there may be a planet often given the name vulcan even closer to the sun than mercury the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse no such planet was ever found and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that vulcan might exist 89 earthshine during a total solar eclipse the moon s shadow covers only a small fraction of the earth the earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse more if the penumbra of the moon s shadow partly misses the earth seen from the moon the earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated with only a small dark patch showing the moon s shadow the brilliantly-lit earth reflects a lot of light to the moon if the corona of the eclipsed sun were not present the moon illuminated by earthlight would be easily visible from earth this would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the moon s phase is a narrow crescent in reality the corona though much less brilliant than the sun s photosphere is much brighter than the moon illuminated by earthlight therefore by contrast the moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black with the corona surrounding it artificial satellites from space the moon s shadow during a solar eclipse appears as a dark spot moving across the earth the moon s shadow over turkey and cyprus seen from the iss during a 2006 total solar eclipse artificial satellites can also pass in front of the sun as seen from the earth but none is large enough to cause an eclipse at the altitude of the international space station for example an object would need to be about 3.35 km 2.08 mi across to blot the sun out entirely these transits are difficult to watch because the zone of visibility is very small the satellite passes over the face of the sun in about a second typically as with a transit of a planet it will not get dark 90 observations of eclipses from spacecraft or artificial satellites orbiting above the earth s atmosphere are not subject to weather conditions the crew of gemini 12 observed a total solar eclipse from space in 1966 91 the partial phase of the 1999 total eclipse was visible from mir 92 during the apollo soyuz test project conducted in july 1975 the apollo spacecraft was positioned to create an artificial solar eclipse giving the soyuz crew an opportunity to photograph the solar corona impact the solar eclipse of march 20 2015 was the first occurrence of an eclipse estimated to potentially have a significant impact on the power system with the electricity sector taking measures to mitigate any impact the continental europe and great britain synchronous areas were estimated to have about 90 gigawatts of solar power and it was estimated that production would temporarily decrease by up to 34 gw compared to a clear sky day 93 94 the temperature may decrease by 3 c and wind power potentially decreases as winds are reduced by 0.7 m s 95 in addition to the drop in light level and air temperature animals change their behavior during totality for example birds and squirrels return to their nests and crickets chirp 96 recent and forthcoming solar eclipses eclipse path for total and hybrid eclipses from 2001 to 2020 eclipses only occur in the eclipse season when the sun is close to either the ascending or descending node of the moon each eclipse is separated by one five or six lunations synodic months and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days which is the mean time for the sun to travel from one node to the next the period is a little less than half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months about 6,585.3 days apart this period 18 years 11.3 days is a saros because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months saros cycles do not endlessly repeat each cycle begins with the moon s shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the moon s shadow misses the earth and the series ends 23 saros cycles are numbered currently cycles 117 to 156 are active the next solar eclipse will occur on february 15 2018 it will be a partial solar eclipse visible from antarctica and south south america 97 solar eclipses 1997 2000 2000 2003 2004
