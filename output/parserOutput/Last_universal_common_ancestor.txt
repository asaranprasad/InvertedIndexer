also called the last universal ancestor lua cenancestor or incorrectly r 1 progenote is the most recent population of organisms from which all organisms now living on earth have a common descent 1 luca is the most recent common ancestor of all current life on earth luca should not be assumed to be the first living organism on earth the luca is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago sometime in the paleoarchean era 2 3 the composition of the luca is not directly accessible as a fossil but can be studied by comparing the genomes of its descendants organisms living today by this means a 2016 study identified a set of 355 genes inferred to have been present in the luca this would imply it was already a complex life form with many co-adapted features including transcription and translation mechanisms to convert information between dna rna and proteins 4 5 some of those genes however could have been acquired later by horizontal gene transfer between archaea and bacteria 6 the earliest evidence of life on earth is biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metamorphized sedimentary rocks discovered in western greenland 7 8 and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in western australia 9 10 a 2015 study found potentially biogenic carbon from 4.1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in western australia but such findings would indicate the existence of different conditions on earth during that period from those generally assumed today and point to an earlier origin of life 11 12 in 2017 there was a published description of putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3.77 billion and possibly 4.28 billion years old in ferruginous sedimentary rocks in quebec canada 13 charles darwin proposed the theory of universal common descent through an evolutionary process in his book on the origin of species in 1859 saying therefore i should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form into which life was first breathed 14 contents 1 features 2 hypotheses 3 location of the root 4 see also 5 remark 6 references 7 external links features edit by analysis of the presumed luca s offspring groups the luca appears to have been a small single-celled organism it likely had a ring-shaped coil of dna floating freely within the cell like modern bacteria morphologically it would likely not have been exceptionally distinctive among a collection of generalized small-size modern-day bacteria however carl woese et al who first proposed the currently-used three domain system based on an analysis of ribosomal rna rrna sequences of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes stated that the luca would have been a simpler more rudimentary entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three domains and their descendants regarding its genetic machinery 15 while the gross anatomy of the luca can only be reconstructed with much uncertainty its internal mechanisms can be described in some detail based on the properties currently shared by all independently living organisms on earth 16 17 18 19 the genetic code was most likely based on dna 20 some studies suggest that the luca may have lacked dna and been defined wholly through rna 21 if dna was present it was composed of four nucleotides deoxyadenosine deoxycytidine deoxythymidine and deoxyguanosine to the exclusion of other possible deoxynucleotides the dna was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent enzyme dna polymerase the integrity of the dna was maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes including dna topoisomerase dna ligase and other dna repair enzymes the dna was also protected by dna-binding proteins such as histones the genetic code was composed of three-nucleotide codons thus producing 64 different codons since only 20 amino acids were used multiple codons code for the same amino acids 16 17 18 19 if the code was dna-based it operated as follows the genetic code was expressed via rna intermediates which were single-stranded the rna was produced by a dna-dependent rna polymerase using nucleotides similar to those of dna with the exception that the nucleotide thymidine in dna was replaced by uridine in rna 16 17 18 19 the genetic code was expressed into proteins these were assembled from free amino acids by translation of a messenger rna by a mechanism composed of ribosomes transfer rnas and a group of related proteins the ribosomes were composed of two subunits one big 50s and one small 30s each ribosomal subunit was composed of a core of ribosomal rna surrounded by ribosomal proteins both types of rna molecules ribosomal and transfer rnas played an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes only 20 amino acids were used to the exclusion of countless other amino acids only the l-isomers of the amino acids were used atp was used as an energy intermediate several hundred enzymes made of protein catalyzed chemical reactions that extract energy from fats sugars and amino acids and that synthesize fats sugars amino acids and nucleic acid bases using arbitrary chemical pathways 16 17 18 19 the cell contained a water-based cytoplasm that was surrounded and effectively enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane inside the cell the concentration of sodium was lower and potassium was higher than outside this gradient was maintained by specific ion transporters also referred to as ion pumps the cell multiplied by duplicating all its contents followed by cellular division 16 17 18 19 the cell used chemiosmosis to produce energy it also reduced co2 and oxidized h2 methanogenesis or acetogenesis via acetyl-thioesters 22 23 the cell probably lived in conditions found in deep sea vents caused by ocean water interacting with magma beneath the ocean floor 24 4 hypotheses edit a 1990 cladogram linking all major groups of living organisms to the luca the black trunk at the bottom based on ribosomal rna sequence data 25 in 1859 charles darwin published on the origin of species in which he twice stated the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms in the summation he states therefore i should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form into which life was first breathed 26 the very last sentence begins with a restatement of the hypothesis there is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one 26 when the luca was hypothesized cladograms based on genetic distance between living cells indicated that archaea split early from the rest of life this was inferred from the fact that the archaeans known at that time were highly resistant to environmental extremes such as high salinity temperature or acidity leading some scientists to suggest that the luca evolved in areas like the deep ocean vents where such extremes prevail today archaea however were later discovered in less hostile environments and are now believed to be more closely related to the eukaryota than to the bacteria although many details are still unknown 27 28 2005 tree of life showing horizontal gene transfers between branches giving rise to an interconnected network rather than a plain hierarchy in 2010 based on the vast array of molecular sequences now available from all domains of life 29 a formal test of universal common ancestry was published 1 the formal test favored the existence of a universal common ancestor over a wide class of alternative hypotheses that included horizontal gene transfer while the formal test overwhelmingly favored the existence of a single luca this does not imply that the luca was ever alone instead it was one of several early microbes 1 however given that many other nucleotides are possible besides those that are actually used in dna and rna today it is almost certain that all organisms do have a single common ancestor this is because it is extremely unlikely that organisms which descended from separate incidents where organic molecules initially came together to form cell-like structures would be able to complete a horizontal gene transfer without garbling each other s genes converting them into noncoding segments further many more amino acids are chemically possible than the twenty found in modern protein molecules these lines of chemical evidence taken into account for the formal statistical test by theobald 2010 point to a single cell having been the luca in that although other early microbes probably existed only the luca s descendents survived beyond the paleoarchean era 30 with a common framework in the at gc rule and the standard twenty amino acids horizontal gene transfer would have been feasible and could have been very common later on among the progeny of that single cell in 1998 carl woese proposed 1 that no individual organism can be considered a luca and 2 that the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through horizontal gene transfer among an ancient community of organisms 31 while the results described by the later papers theobald 2010 and saey 2010 demonstrate the existence of a single luca the argument in woese 1998 can still be applied to ur-organisms at the beginnings of life ancestry was not as linear as it is today because the genetic code took time to evolve 32 before high fidelity replication organisms could not be easily mapped on a phylogenetic tree not to be confused with the ur-organism however the luca lived after the genetic code and at least some rudimentary early form of molecular proofreading had already evolved it was not the very first cell but rather the one whose descendants survived beyond the very early stages of microbial evolution location of the root edit the luca used the wood ljungdahl or reductive acetyl coa pathway to fix carbon the most commonly accepted location of the root of the tree of life is between a monophyletic domain bacteria and a clade formed by archaea and eukaryota of what is referred to as the traditional tree of life based on several molecular studies 33 34 35 36 37 38 a very small minority of studies have concluded differently namely that the root is in the domain bacteria either in the phylum firmicutes 39 or that the phylum chloroflexi is basal to a clade with archaea and eukaryotes and the rest of bacteria as proposed by thomas cavalier-smith 40 research published in 2016 by william f martin by genetically analyzing 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees identified 355 protein clusters from amongst 286,514 protein clusters that were probably common to the luca the results depict luca as anaerobic co2-fixing h2-dependent with a wood ljungdahl pathway the reductive acetyl-coenzyme a pathway n2-fixing and thermophilic luca s biochemistry was replete with fes clusters and radical reaction mechanisms the cofactors also reveal dependence upon transition metals avins s-adenosyl methionine coenzyme a ferredoxin molybdopterin corrins and selenium its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and s-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylations 4 41 42 taken as a whole the results of the study are quite specific 43 they show that methanogenic clostria was a basal clade in the 355 lineages examined and that the luca may therefore have inhabited an anaerobic hydrothermal vent setting in a geochemically active environment rich in h2 co2 and iron 4 however it is not completely clear how to interpret the commonality found in this research these findings could mean that life on earth originated in such hydrothermal vents but could also be interpreted as showing that life was restricted to such locations at some later time in its early history especially if the late heavy bombardment hypothesis is correct 43 the identification of these genes as being present in luca has also been criticized as they may simply represent subsequent horizontal gene transfers between the archaea and the bacteria rather than proteins present in luca 6 see also edit abiogenesis bacterial phyla common descent origin of the first cell protocell panspermia timeline of evolution remark edit there is a common misconception that definitions of luca and progenote are the same however progenote is defined as an organism still in the process of evolving the relationship between genotype and phenotype and it is only hypothesed that luca is a progenote gogarten johann peter deamer david 25 november 2016 is luca a thermophilic progenote nature microbiology 1 16229 doi references edit a b c theobald dl may 2010
