burial chamber of sennedjem c 1200 bc the history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included a diverse range of taxa at least eleven separate regions of the old and new world were involved as independent centers of origin wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 20,000 bc from around 9,500 bc the eight neolithic founder crops emmer wheat einkorn wheat hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax were cultivated in the levant rice was domesticated in china between 11,500 and 6,200 bc followed by mung soy and azuki beans pigs were domesticated in mesopotamia around 11,000 bc followed by sheep between 11,000 and 9,000 bc cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan around 8,500 bc sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around 7,000 bc sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by 5,000 bc in the andes of south america the potato was domesticated between 8,000 and 5,000 bc along with beans coca llamas alpacas and guinea pigs bananas were cultivated and hybridized in the same period in papua new guinea in mesoamerica wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 4,000 bc cotton was domesticated in peru by 3,600 bc camels were domesticated late perhaps around 3,000 bc the bronze age from c 3300 bc witnessed the intensification of agriculture in civilizations such as mesopotamian sumer ancient egypt the indus valley civilisation of south asia ancient china and ancient greece during the iron age and era of classical antiquity the expansion of ancient rome both the republic and then the empire throughout the ancient mediterranean and western europe built upon existing systems of agriculture while also establishing the manorial system that would become a bedrock of medieval agriculture in the middle ages both in the islamic world and in europe agriculture was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants including the introduction of sugar rice cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to europe by way of al-andalus after the voyages of christopher columbus in 1492 the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize potatoes sweet potatoes and manioc to europe and old world crops such as wheat barley rice and turnips and livestock including horses cattle sheep and goats to the americas irrigation crop rotation and fertilizers were introduced soon after the neolithic revolution and developed much further in the past 200 years starting with the british agricultural revolution since 1900 agriculture in the developed nations and to a lesser extent in the developing world has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization and assisted by synthetic fertilizers pesticides and selective breeding the haber-bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale greatly increasing crop yields modern agriculture has raised social political and environmental issues including water pollution biofuels genetically modified organisms tariffs and farm subsidies in response organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to

origins of agriculture studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism examples are the natufian culture in southwest asia and the early chinese neolithic in china current models indicate that wild stands that had been harvested previously started to be planted but were not immediately domesticated 1 2 localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the levant 3 when major climate change took place after the last ice age c 11,000 bc much of the earth became subject to long dry seasons 4 these conditions favoured annual plants which die off in the long dry season leaving a dormant seed or tuber an abundance of readily storable wild grains and pulses enabled hunter-gatherers in some areas to form the first settled villages at this time 5 early development edit sumerian harvester s sickle 3,000 bc made from baked clay early people began altering communities of flora and fauna for their own benefit through means such as fire-stick farming and forest gardening very early 6 7 8 exact dates are hard to determine as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection an example is the semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the younger dryas about 9,500 bc in the early holocene in the levant region of the fertile crescent monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally 9 an indian farmer with a rock-weighted scratch plough pulled by two oxen similar ploughs were used throughout antiquity agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included a diverse range of taxa at least 11 separate regions of the old and new world were involved as independent centers of origin 10 some of the earliest known domestications were of animals pigs were domesticated in mesopotamia around 11,000 bc 11 sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between 11,000 and 9,000 bc 12 cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan around 8,500 bc 13 camels were domesticated late perhaps around 3,000 bc 14 centres of origin identified by nikolai vavilov in the 1930s area 3 is no longer recognised as a centre of origin and papua new guinea not shaded was identified more recently 15 it was not until after 9,500 bc that the eight so-called founder crops of agriculture appear first emmer and einkorn wheat then hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax these eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on pre-pottery neolithic b ppnb sites in the levant although wheat was the first to be grown and harvested on a significant scale at around the same time 9400 bc parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated 16 17 by 7,000 bc sowing and harvesting reached the fertile soil of mesopotamia where sumerians systematized it and scaled it up by 8,000 bc farming was entrenched on the banks of the river nile about this time agriculture was developed independently in the far east probably in china with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop maize was domesticated from the wild grass teosinte in west mexico by 6,700 bc 18 the potato 8,000 bc tomato 19 pepper 4,000 bc squash 8,000 bc and several varieties of bean 8,000 bc onwards were domesticated in the new world 20 agriculture was independently developed on the island of new guinea 21 in greece from c 11,000 bc lentils vetch pistachios and almonds were cultivated while wild oats and wild barley appear in quantity from c 7,000 bc alongside einkorn wheat barley sheep goats and pigs 22 23 while emmer was used on cyprus between 9,100 and 8,600 bc 24 25 banana cultivation of musa acuminata including hybridization dates back to 5,000 bc and possibly to 8,000 bc in papua new guinea 26 27 bees were kept for honey in the middle east around 7,000 bc 28 archaeological evidence from various sites on the iberian peninsula suggest the domestication of plants and animals between 6,000 and 4,500 bc 25 c ide fields in ireland consisting of extensive tracts of land enclosed by stone walls date to 3,500 bc and are the oldest known field systems in the world 29 30 the horse was domesticated in the pontic steppe around 4,000 bc 31 in siberia cannabis was in use in china in neolithic times and may have been domesticated there it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in ancient egypt by about 2,350 bc 32 clay and wood model of a bull cart carrying farm produce in large pots mohenjo-daro the site was abandoned in the 19th century bc in china rice and millet were domesticated by 8,000 bc followed by mung soy and azuki beans in the sahel region of africa local rice and sorghum were domesticated by 5,000 bc kola nut and coffee were domesticated in africa 33 in new guinea ancient papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 bc domesticating sugarcane and taro 34 in the indus valley from the eighth millennium bc onwards at mehrgarh 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated along with einkorn emmer and durum wheats and dates in the earliest levels of merhgarh wild game such as gazelle swamp deer blackbuck chital wild ass wild goat wild sheep boar and nilgai were all hunted for food these are successively replaced by domesticated sheep goats and humped zebu cattle by the fifth millennium bc indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture 35 maize and squash were domesticated in mesoamerica potato in south america and sunflower in the eastern woodlands of north america 36 civilizations edit sumer edit domesticated animals on a sumerian cylinder seal 2500 bc sumerian farmers grew the cereals barley and wheat starting to live in villages from about 8,000 bc given the low rainfall of the region agriculture relied on the tigris and euphrates rivers irrigation canals leading from the rivers permitted the growth of cereals in large enough quantities to support cities the first ploughs appear in pictographs from uruk around 3,000 bc seed-ploughs that funneled seed into the ploughed furrow appear on seals around 2300 bc vegetable crops included chickpeas lentils peas beans onions garlic lettuce leeks and mustard they grew fruits including dates grapes apples melons and figs alongside their farming sumerians also caught fish and hunted fowl and gazelle the meat of sheep goats cows and poultry was eaten mainly by the elite fish was preserved by drying salting and smoking 37 38 ancient egypt edit agricultural scenes of threshing a grain store harvesting with sickles digging tree-cutting and ploughing from ancient egypt tomb of nakht 15th century bc the civilization of ancient egypt was indebted to the nile river and its dependable seasonal flooding the river s predictability and the fertile soil allowed the egyptians to build an empire on the basis of great agricultural wealth egyptians were among the first peoples to practice agriculture on a large scale starting in the pre-dynastic period from the end of the paleolithic into the neolithic between around 10,000 and 4,000 bc 39 this was made possible with the development of basin irrigation 40 their staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus 39 indus valley edit wheat barley and jujube were domesticated in the indian subcontinent by 9,000 bc soon followed by sheep and goats 41 barley and wheat cultivation along with the domestication of cattle primarily sheep and goats followed in mehrgarh culture by 8,000 6,000 bc 42 43 this period also saw the first domestication of the elephant 41 pastoral farming in india included threshing planting crops in rows either of two or of six and storing grain in granaries 43 44 cotton was cultivated by the 5th-4th millennium bc 45 by the 5th millennium bc agricultural communities became widespread in kashmir 43 irrigation was developed in the indus valley civilization by around 4,500 bc 46 the size and prosperity of the indus civilization grew as a result of this innovation leading to more thoroughly planned settlements which used drainage and sewers 46 archeological evidence of an animal-drawn plough dates back to 2,500 bc in the indus valley civilization 47 ancient china edit ancient rice terraces in yuanyang county yunnan records from the warring states qin dynasty and han dynasty provide a picture of early chinese agriculture from the 5th century bc to 2nd century ad which included a nationwide granary system and widespread use of sericulture an important early chinese book on agriculture is the chimin yaoshu of ad 535 written by jia sixia 48 jia s writing style was straightforward and lucid relative to the elaborate and allusive writing typical of the time jia s book was also very long with over one hundred thousand written chinese characters and it quoted many other chinese books that were written previously but no longer survive 49 the contents of jia s 6th century book include sections on land preparation seeding cultivation orchard management forestry and animal husbandry the book also includes peripherally related content covering trade and culinary uses for crops 50 the work and the style in which it was written proved influential on later chinese agronomists such as wang zhen and his groundbreaking nong shu of 1313 49 a northern song era 960 1127 ad chinese watermill for dehusking grain with a horizontal waterwheel for agricultural purposes the chinese had innovated the hydraulic-powered trip hammer by the 1st century bc 51 although it found other purposes its main function to pound decorticate and polish grain that otherwise would have been done manually the chinese also began using the square-pallet chain pump by the 1st century ad powered by a waterwheel or oxen pulling an on a system of mechanical wheels 52 although the chain pump found use in public works of providing water for urban and palatial pipe systems 53 it was used largely to lift water from a lower to higher elevation in filling irrigation canals and channels for farmland 54 by the end of the han dynasty in the late 2nd century heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards 55 56 these would slowly spread west revolutionizing farming in northern europe by the 10th century glick however argues for a development of the chinese plough as late as the 9th century implying its spread east from similar designs known in italy by the 7th century 57 asian rice was domesticated 8,200 13,500 years ago in china with a single genetic origin from the wild rice oryza rufipogon 58 in the pearl river valley region of china rice cultivation then spread to south and southeast asia 59 ancient greece and hellenistic world edit an ear of barley symbol of wealth in the city of metapontum in magna graecia i e the greek colonies of southern italy stamped stater c 530 510 bce the major cereal crops of the ancient mediterranean region were wheat emmer and barley while common vegetables included peas beans fava and olives dairy products came mostly from sheep and goats and meat which was consumed on rare occasion for most people usually consisted of pork beef and lamb 60 agriculture in ancient greece was hindered by the topography of mainland greece that only allowed for roughly 10 of the land to be cultivated properly necessitating the specialized exportation of oil and wine and importation of grains from thrace centered in what is now bulgaria and the greek colonies of southern russia 61 during the hellenistic period the ptolemaic empire controlled egypt cyprus phoenicia and cyrenaica major grain-producing regions that mainland greeks depended on for subsistence while the ptolemaic grain market also played a critical role in the rise of the roman republic 61 in the seleucid empire mesopotamia was a crucial area for the production of wheat while nomadic animal husbandry was also practiced in other parts 61 roman empire edit roman harvesting machine a vallus from a roman wall in belgium which was then part of the province of gallia belgica in the greco-roman world of classical antiquity roman agriculture was built on techniques originally pioneered by the sumerians transmitted to them by subsequent cultures with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export the romans laid the groundwork for the manorial economic system involving serfdom which flourished in the middle ages the farm sizes in rome can be divided into three categories small farms were from 18-88 iugera one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera singular iugerum large estates called latifundia were over 500 iugera 62 the romans had four systems of farm management direct work by owner and his family slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm s produce and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant 62 mesoamerica edit in mesoamerica wild teosinte was transformed through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize more than 6,000 years ago it gradually spread across north america and was the major crop of native americans at the time of european exploration 63 other mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans while cocoa also domesticated in the region was a major crop 34 the turkey one of the most important meat birds was probably domesticated in mexico or the u s southwest 64 in mesoamerica the aztecs were active farmers and had an agriculturally focused economy the land around lake texcoco was fertile but not large enough to produce the amount of food needed for the population of their expanding empire the aztecs developed irrigation systems formed terraced hillsides fertilized their soil and developed chinampas or artificial islands also known as floating gardens the mayas between 400 bc to 900 ad used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland on the yucat n peninsula 65 66 south america edit inca farmers using a human-powered foot plough in the andes region of south america with civilizations including the inca the major crop was the potato domesticated approximately 7,000 10,000 years ago 67 68 69 coca still a major crop to this day was domesticated in the andes as were the peanut tomato tobacco and pineapple 34 cotton was domesticated in peru by 3,600 bc 70 animals were also domesticated including llamas alpacas and guinea pigs 71 north america edit the indigenous people of the eastern u s a domesticated numerous crops sunflowers tobacco 72 varieties of squash and chenopodium as well as crops no longer grown including marsh elder and little barley were domesticated 73 74 wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested 75 the domesticated strawberry is a hybrid of a chilean and a north american species developed by breeding in europe and north america 76 two major crops pecans and concord grapes were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but do not appear to have been domesticated until the 19th century 77 78 the indigenous people in what is now california and the pacific northwest practiced various forms of forest gardening and fire-stick farming in the forests grasslands mixed woodlands and wetlands ensuring that desired food and medicine plants continued to be available the natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a low-intensity fire ecology which prevented larger catastrophic fires and sustained a low-density agriculture in loose rotation a sort of wild permaculture 79 80 81 82 a system of companion planting called the three sisters was developed in north america three crops that complemented each other were planted together winter squash maize corn and climbing beans typically tepary beans or common beans the maize provides a structure for the beans to climb eliminating the need for poles the beans provide the nitrogen to the soil that the other plants use and the squash spreads along the ground blocking the sunlight helping prevent the establishment of weeds the squash leaves also act as a living mulch 83 84 australia edit native millet panicum decompositum was planted and harvested by indigenous australians in eastern central australia from the time of british colonization of australia in 1788 indigenous australians were characterised as nomadic hunter-gatherers who did not engage in agriculture despite evidence to the contrary in 1969 the archaeologist rhys jones proposed that indigenous australians engaged in systematic burning as a way of enhancing natural productivity what has been termed fire-stick farming 85 in the 1970s and 1980s archaeological research in south west victoria established that the gunditjmara and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly 5,000 years 86 the archaeologist harry lourandos suggested in the 1980s that there was evidence of intensification in progress across australia 87 a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding 5,000 years these concepts led the historian bill gammage to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape 6 in two regions of australia the central west coast and eastern central australia forms of early agriculture may have been practiced people living in permanent settlements of over 200 residents sowed or planted on a large scale and stored the harvested food the nhanda and amangu of the central west coast grew yams dioscorea hastifolia while various groups in eastern central australia the corners region planted and harvested bush onions yaua - cyperus bulbosus native millet cooly tindil panicum decompositum and a sporocarp ngardu marsilea drummondii 6 281 304 88 middle ages and early modern edit from 100 bc to 1600 ad world population continued to grow along with land use as evidenced by the rapid increase in methane emissions from cattle and the cultivation of rice 89 arab world edit noria wheels to lift water for irrigation and household use were among the technologies introduced to europe via al-andalus in the medieval islamic world from the 8th century the medieval islamic world underwent a transformation in agricultural practice described by the historian andrew watson as the arab agricultural revolution 90 this transformation was driven by a number of factors including the diffusion of many crops and plants along muslim trade routes the spread of more advanced farming techniques and an agricultural-economic system which promoted increased yields and efficiency the shift in agricultural practice changed the economy population distribution vegetation cover agricultural production population levels urban growth the distribution of the labour force cooking diet and clothing across the islamic world muslim traders covered much of the old world and trade enabled the diffusion of many crops plants and farming techniques across the region as well as the adaptation of crops plants and techniques from beyond the islamic world 90 this diffusion introduced major crops to europe by way of al-andalus along with the techniques for their cultivation and cuisine sugar cane rice and cotton were among the major crops transferred along with citrus and other fruit trees nut trees vegetables such as aubergine spinach and chard and the use of spices such as cumin coriander nutmeg and cinnamon intensive irrigation crop rotation and agricultural manuals were widely adopted irrigation partly based on roman technology made use of noria water wheels water mills dams and reservoirs 90 91 92 europe edit the middle ages saw further improvements in agriculture monasteries spread throughout europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry the manorial system allowed large landowners to control their land and its laborers in the form of peasants or serfs 93 during the medieval period the arab world was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the european asia and african continents besides transporting numerous crops they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to europe and developed the beginnings of the plantation system of sugarcane growing through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation 94 agricultural calendar c 1470 from a manuscript of pietro de crescenzi by ad 900 developments in iron smelting allowed for increased production in europe leading to developments in the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs hand tools and horse shoes the carruca heavy plough improved on the earlier scratch plough with the adoption of the chinese mouldboard plough to turn over the heavy wet soils of northern europe this led to the clearing of northern european forests and an increase in agricultural production which in turn led to an increase in population 95 96 at the same time some farmers in europe moved from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year this resulted in increased productivity and nutrition as the change in rotations permitted nitrogen-fixing legumes such as peas lentils and beans 97 improved horse harnesses and the whippletree further improved cultivation 98 watermills were introduced by the romans but were improved throughout the middle ages along with windmills and used to grind grains into flour to cut wood and to process flax and wool 99 crops included wheat rye barley and oats peas beans and vetches became common from the 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals and also for their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties crop yields peaked in the 13th century and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century 100 though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the middle ages recent studies 101 102 have shown that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times such as the terrible weather of 1315 17 that the needs of the population could not be met 103 104 columbian exchange edit the harvesters pieter bruegel 1565 after 1492 a global exchange of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred maize potatoes sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the new world to the old while varieties of wheat barley rice and turnips traveled from the old world to the new there had been few livestock species in the new world with horses cattle sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with old world settlers crops moving in both directions across the atlantic ocean caused population growth around the world and a lasting effect on many cultures 105 maize and cassava were introduced from brazil into africa by portuguese traders in the 16th century 106 becoming staple foods replacing native african crops 107 after its introduction from south america to spain in the late 1500s the potato became a staple crop throughout europe by the late 1700s the potato allowed farmers to produce more food and initially added variety to the european diet the increased supply of food reduced disease increased births and reduced mortality causing a population boom throughout the british empire the us and europe 108 the introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer in the form of guano imported to europe from peru and the first artificial pesticide in the form of an arsenic compound used to fight colorado potato beetles before the adoption of the potato as a major crop the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed including 17 major famines in england between 1523 and 1623 the resulting dependence on the potato however caused the european potato failure a disastrous crop failure from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in ireland alone 109 modern agriculture edit british agricultural revolution edit the agriculturalist charles turnip townshend introduced four-field crop rotation and the cultivation of turnips between the 16th century and the mid-19th century britain saw a large increase in agricultural productivity and net output new agricultural practices like enclosure mechanization four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750 freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce and thereby helped drive the industrial revolution the productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840 marking a major turning point in history 110 jethro tull s seed drill invented in 1701 advice on more productive techniques for farming began to appear in england in the mid-17th century from writers such as samuel hartlib walter blith and others 111 the main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients most importantly nitrogen levels in the soil to allow the soil to regenerate productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used the dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the british agriculturist charles townshend in the 18th century the system wheat turnips barley and clover opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round the use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates 112 the mechanisation and rationalisation of agriculture was another important factor robert bakewell and thomas coke introduced selective breeding and initiated a process of inbreeding to maximise desirable traits from the mid 18th century such as the new leicester sheep machines were invented to improve the efficiency of various agricultural operation such as jethro tull s seed drill of 1701 that mechanised seeding at the correct depth and spacing and andrew meikle s threshing machine of 1784 ploughs were steadily improved from joseph foljambe s rotherham iron plough in 1730 113 to james small s improved scots plough metal in 1763 in 1789 ransomes sims jefferies was producing 86 plough models for different soils 114 powered farm machinery began with richard trevithick s stationary steam engine used to drive a threshing machine in 1812 115 mechanisation spread to other farm uses through the 19th century the first petrol-driven tractor was built in america by john froelich in 1892 116 the scientific investigation of fertilization began at the rothamsted experimental station in 1843 by john bennet lawes he investigated the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield and founded one of the first artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 1842 fertilizer in the shape of sodium nitrate deposits in chile was imported to britain by john thomas north as well as guano birds droppings the first commercial process for fertilizer production was the obtaining of phosphate from the dissolution of coprolites in sulphuric acid 117 20th century edit early 20th century image of a tractor ploughing an alfalfa field dan albone constructed the first commercially successful gasoline-powered general purpose tractor in 1901 and the 1923 international harvester farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals particularly horses with machines since that time self-propelled mechanical harvesters combines planters transplanters and other equipment have been developed further revolutionizing agriculture 118 these inventions allowed farming tasks to be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit 119 bt-toxins in genetically modified peanut leaves bottom protect from damage by corn borers top 120 the haber-bosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints it was first patented by german chemist fritz haber in 1910 carl bosch while working for german chemical company basf successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents in the years after world war ii the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly in sync with the increasing world population 121 collective farming was widely practiced in the soviet union the eastern bloc countries china and vietnam starting in the 1930s in the soviet union one result was the soviet famine of 1932 33 122 in the past century agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor water pollution 123 and farm subsidies 124 other applications of scientific research since 1950 in agriculture include gene manipulation 125 126 hydroponics 127 and the development of economically viable biofuels such as ethanol 128 in recent years there has been a backlash against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture resulting in the organic movement 129 famines continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century through the effects of climactic events government policy war and crop failure millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s 130 the historical processes that have allowed agricultural crops to be cultivated and eaten well beyond their centers of origin continues in the present through globalization on average 68.7 of a nation s food supplies and 69.3 of its agricultural production are of crops with foreign origins 131 green revolution edit norman borlaug father of the green revolution of the 1970s is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation the green revolution was a series of research development and technology transfer initiatives between the 1940s and the late 1970s it increased agriculture production around the world especially from the late 1960s the initiatives led by norman borlaug and credited with saving over a billion people from starvation involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains expansion of irrigation infrastructure modernization of management techniques distribution of hybridized seeds synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to farmers 132 synthetic nitrogen along with mined rock phosphate pesticides and mechanization have greatly increased crop yields in the early 20th century increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well further global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice wheat and corn were introduced as a part of the green revolution the green revolution exported the technologies including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen of the developed world to the developing world thomas malthus famously predicted that the earth would not be able to support its growing population but technologies such as the green revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food 133 although the green revolution significantly increased rice yields in asia yield increases have not occurred in the past 15 20 years 134 the genetic yield potential has increased for wheat but the yield potential for rice has not increased since 1966 and the yield potential for maize has barely increased in 35 years 134 it takes only a decade or two for herbicide-resistant weeds to emerge and insects become resistant to insecticides within about a decade delayed somewhat by crop rotation 134 organic agriculture edit an organic farmer california 1972 for most of its history agriculture has been organic without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides and without gmos with the advent of chemical agriculture rudolf steiner called for farming without synthetic pesticides and his agriculture course of 1924 laid the foundation for biodynamic agriculture 135 lord northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic farming in 1940 this became a worldwide movement and organic farming is now practiced in most countries 136 see also edit historical hydroculture history of
