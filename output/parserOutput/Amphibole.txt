amph bolos meaning ambiguous was used by ren just ha y to include tremolite actinolite and hornblende the group was so named by ha y in allusion to the protean variety in composition and appearance assumed by its minerals this term has since been applied to the whole group numerous sub-species and varieties are distinguished the more important of which are tabulated below in two series the formulae of each will be seen to be built on the general double-chain silicate formula rsi4o11 3 four of the amphibole minerals are among the minerals commonly called asbestos these are anthophyllite riebeckite cummingtonite grunerite series and actinolite tremolite series the cummingtonite grunerite series is often termed amosite or brown asbestos riebeckite is known as crocidolite or blue asbestos these are generally called amphibole asbestos 4 mineral species edit chemical formula edit orthorhombic series anthophyllite mg mg 7si8o22 oh 2 holmquistite li2mg3al2si8o22 oh 2 ferrogedrite fe2 5al4si6o22 oh 2 monoclinic series tremolite ca2mg5si8o22 oh 2 actinolite ca2 mg fe 5si8o22 oh 2 cummingtonite fe2mg5si8o22 oh 2 grunerite fe7si8o22 oh 2 hornblende k na 0-1 ca na fe mg 2 mg fe al 5 al si 8o22 oh 2 glaucophane na2 mg fe 3al2si8o22 oh 2 riebeckite or crocidolite na2fe2 3fe3 2si8o22 oh 2 arfvedsonite na3fe2 4fe3 si8o22 oh 2 richterite na2ca mg fe 5si8o22 oh 2 pargasite naca2mg3fe2 si6al3o22 oh 2 winchite cana mg4 al fe3 si8o22 oh 2 edenite naca2mg5 si7al o22 oh 2 descriptions edit on account of the wide variations in chemical composition the different members vary considerably in properties and general appearance anthophyllite occurs as brownish fibrous or lamellar masses with hornblende in mica-schist at kongsberg in norway and some other localities an aluminous related species is known as gedrite and a deep green russian variety containing little iron as kupfferite 3 hornblende is an important constituent of many igneous rocks it is also an important constituent of amphibolites formed by metamorphism of basalt actinolite is an important and common member of the monoclinic series forming radiating groups of acicular crystals of a bright green or greyish-green color it occurs frequently as a constituent of greenschists the name from greek akt s akt nos a ray and l thos a stone is a translation of the old german word strahlstein radiated stone 3 glaucophane crocidolite riebeckite and arfvedsonite form a somewhat special group of alkali-amphiboles the first two are blue fibrous minerals with glaucophane occurring in blueschists and crocidolite blue asbestos in ironstone formations both resulting from dynamo-metamorphic processes the latter two are dark green minerals which occur as original constituents of igneous rocks rich in sodium such as nepheline-syenite and phonolite 3 pargasite is a rare magnesium-rich amphibole with essential sodium usually found in ultramafic rocks for instance it occurs in uncommon mantle xenoliths carried up by kimberlite it is hard dense black and usually idiomorphic with a red-brown pleochroism in petrographic thin section see also edit list of minerals classification of minerals -
