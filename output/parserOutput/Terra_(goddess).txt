terra mythology - wikipedia terra mythology from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from terra goddess jump to navigation search a syncretic tellus reclining with four children probably the seasons accompanied by aion- uranus within a zodiac wheel mosaic from sentinum ad 200-250 glyptothek in ancient roman religion and myth tellus mater or terra mater mother earth is a goddess of the earth although tellus and terra are hardly distinguishable during the imperial era 1 tellus was the name of the original earth goddess in the religious practices of the republic or earlier 2 the scholar varro 1st century bc lists tellus as one of the di selecti the twenty principal gods of rome and one of the twelve agricultural deities 3 she is regularly associated with ceres in rituals pertaining to the earth and agricultural fertility the attributes of tellus were the cornucopia or bunches of flowers or fruit she was typically depicted reclining 4 her male complement was a sky god such as caelus uranus or a form of jupiter a male counterpart tellumo or tellurus is mentioned though rarely her greek counterpart is gaia 5 and among the etruscans she was cel michael lipka has argued that the terra mater who appears during the reign of augustus is a direct transferral of the greek ge mater into roman religious practice while tellus whose temple was within rome s sacred boundary pomerium represents the original earth goddess cultivated by the state priests 6 the word tellus telluris is also a latin common noun for land territory earth as is terra earth ground in literary uses particularly in poetry it may be ambiguous as to whether the goddess a personification or the common noun is meant this article preserves the usage of the ancient sources regarding tellus or terra contents 1 name 2 temple 3 festivals 4 prayers and rituals 5 iconography 6 tellumo 7 in science 8 see also 9 references name edit a dedicatory inscription to terra mater fulfilling a vow votum 1st century ad the two words terra and tellus are thought to derive from the formulaic phrase tersa tellus meaning dry land citation needed the etymology of tellus is uncertain it is perhaps related to sanskrit talam plain ground 7 the 4th-century ad latin commentator servius distinguishes between tellus and terra in usage terra he says is properly used of the elementum earth as one of the four classical elements with air ventus water aqua and fire ignis tellus is the goddess whose name can be substituted ponimus pro for her functional sphere the earth just as the name vulcanus is used for fire ceres for produce and liber for wine 8 tellus thus refers to the guardian deity of earth and by extension the globe itself 9 tellus may be an aspect of the numen called dea dia by the arval priests 10 or at least a close collaborator with her as divinity of the clear sky 11 varro identifies terra mater with ceres not without cause was the earth terra called mater and ceres it was believed that those who cultivated her led a pious and useful life piam et utilem vitam and that they were the sole survivors from the line of king saturn 12 ovid distinguishes between tellus as the locus site location of growth and ceres as its causa cause agent 13 mater the latin word for mother is often used as an honorific for goddesses including vesta who was represented as a virgin mother therefore expresses the respect that one would owe a mother though tellus and terra are both regarded as mothers in the genealogical sense as well temple edit the temple of tellus was the most prominent landmark of the carinae 14 a fashionable neighborhood on the oppian hill 15 it was near homes dom s belonging to pompey 16 and to the cicero family 17 the temple was the result of a votum made in 268 bc by publius sempronius sophus when an earthquake struck during a battle with the picenes 18 others 19 say it was built by the roman people it occupied the former site of a house belonging to spurius cassius which had been torn down when he was executed in 485 bc for attempting to make himself king 20 the temple constructed by sophus more than two centuries later was most likely a rebuilding of the people s 21 the anniversary dies natalis of its dedication was december 13 a mysterious object called the magmentarium was stored in the temple 22 which was also known for a representation of italy on the wall either a map or an allegory 23 a statue of quintus cicero set up by his brother marcus was among those that stood on the temple grounds 24 cicero claims that the proximity of his property caused some romans to assume he had a responsibility to help maintain the temple 25 festivals edit detail from a sarcophagus depicting a mother earth figure 3rd century ad festivals celebrated for tellus were mainly concerned with agriculture and often connected with ceres in january both goddesses were honored as mothers of produce 26 at the moveable feast feriae conceptivae of sementivae a festival of sowing 27 on december 13 the anniversary of the temple of tellus was celebrated along with a lectisternium banquet for ceres who embodied growing power and the productivity of the earth 28 tellus received the sacrifice of a pregnant cow at the fordicidia a festival pertaining to fertility and animal husbandry 29 held april 15 in the middle of the cerialia april 12 19 30 festivals for deities of vegetation and the earth cluster in april on the roman calendar 31 the institution of the fordicidia was attributed to numa pompilius the sabine second king of rome during a time when rome was struggling with harsh agricultural conditions numa was instructed by the rustic god faunus in a dream that a sacrifice to tellus was needed as is often the case with oracles the message required interpretation by the death of cattle king tellus must be placated two cows that is let a single heifer yield two lives animae for the rites 32 numa solved the riddle by instituting the sacrifice of a pregnant cow 33 the purpose of the sacrifice as suggested by the augustan poet ovid and by the 6th-century antiquarian john lydus was to assure the fertility of the planted grain already growing in the womb of mother earth in the guise of tellus 34 this public sacrifice was conducted in the form of a holocaust on behalf of the state at the capitol and also by each of the thirty curiae the most ancient divisions of the city made by romulus from the original three tribes 35 the state sacrifice was presided over by the vestals who used the ash from the holocaust to prepare suffimen a ritual substance used later in april for the parilia 36 during the secular games held by augustus in 17 bc terra mater was among the deities honored in the tarentum in the campus martius her ceremonies were conducted by greek rite ritus graecus distinguishing her from the roman tellus whose temple was within the pomerium she received the holocaust of a pregnant sow 37 the secular games of 249 bc had been dedicated to the underworld deities dis pater and proserpina whose underground altar was in the tarentum under augustus the games ludi were dedicated to seven other deities invoked as the moerae iuppiter ilithyia iuno terra mater apollo and diana 38 prayers and rituals edit the sacrum ceriale cereal rite was carried out for tellus and ceres by a flamen probably the flamen cerialis who also invoked twelve male helper gods 39 according to varro 40 the two goddesses jointly received the porca praecidanea a pig sacrificed in advance of the harvest 41 some rites originally pertaining to tellus may have been transferred to ceres or shared with her as a result of her identification with greek demeter 42 tellus was felt to be present during rites of passage either implicitly or invoked she was perhaps involved in the ceremonies attending the birth of a child as the newborn was placed on the ground immediately after coming into the world citation needed tellus was also invoked at roman weddings 43 dedicatory inscriptions to either tellus or terra are relatively few 44 but epitaphs during the imperial period sometimes contain formulaic expressions such as terra mater receive me 45 in the provincial mining area of pannonia at present-day ljubija votive inscriptions record dedications to terra mater from vilici imperial slave overseers who ran operations at ore smelting factories ferrariae 46 these are all dated april 21 when the founding day dies natalis birthday of rome was celebrated perhaps reflecting the connection between the parilia on april 21 and the fordicidia as a feast of tellus 47 the emperor septimius severus restored a temple of terra mater at rudnik a silver mining area of moesia superior 48 measuring 30 by 20 meters the temple was located at the entrance to the work zone 49 iconography edit the attributes of the central figure on this panel of the ara pacis mark her as an earth and mother goddess often identified as tellus tellus is often identified as the central figure on the so-called italia relief panel of the ara pacis which is framed by bucrania ornamental ox heads and motifs of vegetative and animal fertility and abundance 50 tellumo edit tellumo is identified by st augustine as the male counterpart of tellus 51 a tellurus is named uniquely by martianus capella 1.49 52 in
