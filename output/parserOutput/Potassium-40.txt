long half-life of 1.251 109 years it makes up 0.012 120 ppm of the total amount of potassium found in nature potassium-40 is a rare example of an isotope that undergoes both types of beta decay about 89.28 of the time it decays to calcium-40 40ca with emission of a beta particle an electron with a maximum energy of 1.31 mev and an antineutrino about 10.72 of the time it decays to argon-40 40ar by electron capture with the emission of a 1.460 mev gamma ray 1 and a neutrino the radioactive decay of this particular isotope explains the large abundance of argon nearly 1 in the earth s atmosphere as well as its abundance compared to 36ar very rarely 0.001 of the time it will decay to 40ar by emitting a positron and a neutrino 2 contents 1 potassium argon dating 2 contribution to natural radioactivity 3 see also 4 notes and references 5 external links potassium argon dating edit decay scheme potassium-40 is especially important in potassium argon k ar dating argon is a gas that does not ordinarily combine with other elements so when a mineral forms whether from molten rock or from substances dissolved in water it will be initially argon-free even if there is some argon in the liquid however if the mineral contains any potassium then decay of the 40k isotope present will create fresh argon-40 that will remain locked up in the mineral since the rate at which this conversion occurs is known it is possible to determine the elapsed time since the mineral formed by measuring the ratio of 40k and 40ar atoms contained in it the argon found in earth s atmosphere is 99.6 40ar whereas the argon in the sun and presumably in the primordial material that condensed into the planets is mostly 36ar with less than 15 of 38ar it follows that most of the terrestrial argon derives from potassium-40 that decayed into argon-40 which eventually escaped to the atmosphere contribution to natural radioactivity edit the evolution of earth s mantle radiogenic heat flow over time contribution from 40k in yellow the radioactive decay of 40k in the earth s mantle ranks third after 232th and 238u as the source of radiogenic heat the core also likely contains radiogenic sources although how much is uncertain it has been proposed that significant core radioactivity 1-2 tw may be caused by high levels of u th and k 3 4 40k is the largest source of natural radioactivity in animals including humans a 70 kg human body contains about 140 grams of potassium hence about 0.000117 140 0.0164 grams of 40k whose decay produces about 4,300 disintegrations per second becquerels continuously throughout the life of the body 5 6 see also edit isotopes of potassium banana equivalent dose notes and references edit this photon would be called an x-ray if emitted from an electron in nuclear physics it is common to name photons according to their origin rather than their energy high energy photons produced by electrical transitions are called x-rays while those emitted from atomic nuclei are called gamma rays irrespective of their energy engelkemeir d w flynn k f glendenin l e 1962 positron emission in the decay of k40 physical review 126 5 1818 bibcode doi wohlers a
