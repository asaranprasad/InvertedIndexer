june 10 1927 is an american solar astrophysicist who in the mid-1950s developed the theory of the supersonic solar wind and predicted the parker spiral shape of the solar magnetic field in the outer solar system in 1987 parker proposed that the solar corona might be heated by myriad tiny nanoflares miniature brightenings resembling solar flares that would occur all over the surface of the sun 1 2 parker spent four years at the university of utah and has been at the university of chicago since 1955 where he has held positions in the physics department the astronomy and astrophysics department and the enrico fermi institute 1 parker was elected to the national academy of sciences in 1967 1 in 2017 nasa renamed its solar probe plus to parker solar probe in his honor marking the first time nasa had named a spacecraft after a living person 3 in 2018 the american physical society awarded him the medal for exceptional achievement in research 4 contents 1 biography 1.1 hypotheses 2 honors 3

has been at the university of chicago since 1955 where he has held positions in the physics department the astronomy and astrophysics department and the enrico fermi institute 1 parker was elected to the national academy of sciences in 1967 1 hypotheses edit in the mid-1950s parker developed the theory on the supersonic solar wind and predicted the parker spiral shape of the solar magnetic field in the outer solar system his theoretical modeling was not immediately accepted by the astronomical community in fact when he submitted the results to the astrophysical journal two reviewers rejected it the editor of the astrophysical journal subrahmanyan chandrasekhar overruled the reviewers and published the paper 5 his models were resoundingly verified by satellite observations a few years later in the early 1960s his work has greatly increased understanding of the solar corona the solar wind the magnetic fields of both the earth and the sun and their complex electromagnetic interactions his books especially cosmical magnetic fields have educated generations of investigators weasel words his most recent book includes the effects of magnetic fields of planets stars and galaxies on x-ray emissions 2 in 1987 parker proposed that the solar corona might be heated by myriad tiny nanoflares miniature brightenings resembling solar flares that would occur all over the surface of the sun 1 2 honors edit arctowski medal of the national academy of sciences 1969 6 henry norris russell lectureship of the american astronomical society 1969 george ellery hale prize
