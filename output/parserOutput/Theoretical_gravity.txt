theoretical gravity - wikipedia theoretical gravity from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in geodesy and geophysics theoretical gravity or normal gravity is an approximation of the true effective or apparent gravity on earth s surface by means of a mathematical model representing a physically smoothed earth the most common model of a smoothed earth is an earth ellipsoid or more specifically an earth spheroid i e an ellipsoid of revolution various successively more refined formulas for computing the theoretical gravity are referred to as the international gravity formula the first of which was proposed in 1930 by the international association of geodesy the general shape of that formula is g g e 1 a sin 2 b sin 2 2 displaystyle g phi g e left 1 a sin 2 phi -b sin 2 2 phi right in which g is the gravity as a function of the geographic latitude of the position whose gravity is to be determined g e displaystyle g e denotes the gravity at the equator as determined by measurement and the coefficients a and b are parameters that must be selected to produce a good global fit to true gravity 1 using the values of the grs80 reference system a commonly used specific instantiation of the formula above is given by g 9.780327 1 0.0053024 sin 2 0.0000058 sin 2 2 m s 2 displaystyle g phi 9.780327 left 1 0.0053024 sin 2 phi -0.0000058 sin 2 2 phi right mathrm ms -2 1 using the appropriate double-angle formula in combination with the pythagorean identity this can be rewritten in the equivalent forms g 9.780327 1 0.0052792 sin 2 0.0000232 sin 4 m s 2 9.780327 1.0053024 .0053256 cos 2 .0000232 cos 4 m s 2 9.780327 1.0026454 0.0026512 cos 2 .0000058 cos 2 2 m s 2 displaystyle begin aligned g phi 9.780327 left 1 0.0052792 sin 2 phi 0.0000232 sin 4 phi right mathrm ms -2 9.780327 left 1.0053024-.0053256 cos 2 phi .0000232 cos 4 phi right mathrm ms -2 9.780327 left 1.0026454-0.0026512 cos 2 phi .0000058 cos 2 2 phi right mathrm ms -2 end aligned up to the 1960s formulas based on the hayford ellipsoid 1924 and of the famous german geodesist helmert 1906 were often used citation needed the difference between the semi-major axis equatorial radius of the hayford ellipsoid and that of the modern wgs84 ellipsoid is 7002251000000000000 251 m for helmert s ellipsoid it is only 7001630000000000000 63 m a more recent theoretical formula for gravity as a function of latitude is the international gravity formula 1980 igf80 also based on the wgs80 ellipsoid but now using the somigliana equation g g e 1 k sin 2 1 e 2 sin 2 displaystyle g phi g e left frac 1 k sin 2 phi sqrt 1-e 2 sin 2 phi right where 2 a b displaystyle a b are the equatorial and polar semi-axes respectively e 2 a 2 b 2 a 2 displaystyle e 2 frac a 2 -b 2 a 2 is the spheroid s eccentricity squared g e g p displaystyle g e g p is the defined gravity at the equator and poles respectively k b g p a g e a g e displaystyle k frac bg p -ag e ag e formula constant providing g 9.7803267715 1 0.001931851353 sin 2 1 0.0066943800229 sin 2 m s 2 displaystyle g phi 9.7803267715 left frac 1 0.001931851353 sin 2 phi sqrt 1-0.0066943800229 sin 2 phi right mathrm ms -2 1 a later refinement based on the wgs84 ellipsoid is the wgs world geodetic system 1984 ellipsoidal gravity formula 2 g 9.7803253359 1 0.00193185265241 sin 2 1 0.00669437999013 sin 2 m s 2 displaystyle g phi 9.7803253359 left frac 1 0.00193185265241 sin 2 phi sqrt 1-0.00669437999013 sin 2 phi right mathrm ms -2 where g p displaystyle g p 9.8321849378 ms 2 the difference with igf80 is insignificant when used for geophysical purposes 1 but may be significant for other uses see also edit gravity anomaly reference ellipsoid egm96 earth gravitational model 1996 standard gravity 9.806 65 m s2 literature edit karl ledersteger astronomische und physikalische geod sie handbuch der vermessungskunde band 5 10 auflage metzler stuttgart 1969 b hofmann-wellenhof helmut moritz physical geodesy isbn 3-211-23584-1 springer-verlag wien 2006 references edit a b c d william j hinze ralph r b von frese afif h saad 2013 gravity and magnetic exploration principles practices and applications cambridge university press p 130 isbn 978-1-107-32819-8 a b this geodesy-related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by v t retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title theoretical gravity oldid 788764727 categories gravimetry geophysics stubs cartography stubs hidden categories all articles with unsourced statements articles with unsourced statements from september 2015 all stub articles navigation menu search this page was last edited on 3 july 2017 at 10 40 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
