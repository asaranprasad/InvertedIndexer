external links definition columnar basalt flows in yellowstone national park usa by definition basalt is an aphanitic fine-grained igneous rock with generally 45-53 silica sio2 2 and less than 10 feldspathoid by volume and where at least 65 of the rock is feldspar in the form of plagioclase this is as per definition of the international union of geological sciences iugs classification scheme 3 4 5 it is the most common volcanic rock type on earth being a key component of oceanic crust as well as the principal volcanic rock in many mid-oceanic islands including iceland the faroe islands r union and the islands of hawaii basalt commonly features a very fine-grained or glassy matrix interspersed with visible mineral grains the average density is 3.0 g cm3 basalt is defined by its mineral content and texture and physical descriptions without mineralogical context may be unreliable in some circumstances basalt is usually grey to black in colour but rapidly weathers to brown or rust-red due to oxidation of its mafic iron-rich minerals into hematite and other iron oxides and hydroxides although usually characterized as dark basaltic rocks exhibit a wide range of shading due to regional geochemical processes due to weathering or high concentrations of plagioclase some basalts can be quite light-coloured superficially resembling andesite to untrained eyes basalt has a fine-grained mineral texture due to the molten rock cooling too quickly for large mineral crystals to grow it is often porphyritic containing larger crystals phenocrysts formed prior to the extrusion that brought the magma to the surface embedded in a finer-grained matrix these phenocrysts usually are of olivine or a calcium-rich plagioclase which have the highest melting temperatures of the typical minerals that can crystallize from the melt basalt with a vesicular texture is called vesicular basalt when the bulk of the rock is mostly solid when the vesicles are over half the volume of a specimen it is called scoria this texture forms when dissolved gases come out of solution and form bubbles as the magma decompresses as it reaches the surface yet are trapped as the erupted lava hardens before the gases can escape the term basalt is at times applied to shallow intrusive rocks with a composition typical of basalt but rocks of this composition with a phaneritic coarser groundmass are generally referred to as diabase also called dolerite or when more coarse-grained crystals over 2 mm across as gabbro gabbro is often marketed commercially as black granite columnar basalt at szent gy rgy hill hungary vesicular basalt at sunset crater arizona us quarter for scale in the hadean archean and early proterozoic eras of earth s history the chemistry of erupted magmas was significantly different from today s due to immature crustal and asthenosphere differentiation these ultramafic volcanic rocks with silica sio2 contents below 45 are usually classified as komatiites etymology the word basalt is ultimately derived from late latin basaltes a misspelling of latin basanites very hard stone which was imported from ancient greek basanites from basanos touchstone and perhaps originated in egyptian bauhun slate 6 the modern petrological term basalt describing a particular composition of lava-derived rock originates from its use by georgius agricola in 1556 in his famous work of mining and mineralogy de re metallica libri xii agricola applied basalt to the volcanic black rock of the schlo berg local castle hill at stolpen believing it to be the same as the very hard stone described by pliny the elder in naturalis historiae 7 types large masses must cool slowly to form a polygonal joint pattern as here at the giant s causeway in northern ireland near bazaltove ukraine tholeiitic basalt is relatively rich in silica and poor in sodium included in this category are most basalts of the ocean floor most large oceanic islands and continental flood basalts such as the columbia river plateau high and low titanium basalts basalt rocks are in some cases classified after their titanium ti content in high-ti and low-ti varieties high-ti and low-ti basalts have been distinguished in the paran and etendeka traps 8 and the emeishan traps 9 mid-ocean ridge basalt morb is a tholeiitic basalt commonly erupted only at ocean ridges and is characteristically low in incompatible elements 10 11 e-morb enriched morb n-morb normal morb d-morb depleted morb high-alumina basalt may be silica-undersaturated or -oversaturated see normative mineralogy it has greater than 17 alumina al2o3 and is intermediate in composition between tholeiitic basalt and alkali basalt the relatively alumina-rich composition is based on rocks without phenocrysts of plagioclase alkali basalt is relatively poor in silica and rich in sodium it is silica-undersaturated and may contain feldspathoids alkali feldspar and phlogopite boninite is a high-magnesium form of basalt that is erupted generally in back-arc basins distinguished by its low titanium content and trace-element composition ocean island basalt lunar basalt petrology photomicrograph of a volcanic basaltic sand grain upper picture is plane-polarized light bottom picture is cross-polarized light scale box at left-center is 0.25 millimeter note white plagioclase microlites in cross-polarized light picture surrounded by very fine grained volcanic glass the mineralogy of basalt is characterized by a preponderance of calcic plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene olivine can also be a significant constituent accessory minerals present in relatively minor amounts include iron oxides and iron-titanium oxides such as magnetite ulvospinel and ilmenite because of the presence of such oxide minerals basalt can acquire strong magnetic signatures as it cools and paleomagnetic studies have made extensive use of basalt in tholeiitic basalt pyroxene augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite and calcium-rich plagioclase are common phenocryst minerals olivine may also be a phenocryst and when present may have rims of pigeonite the groundmass contains interstitial quartz or tridymite or cristobalite olivine tholeiitic basalt has augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite with abundant olivine but olivine may have rims of pyroxene and is unlikely to be present in the groundmass ocean floor basalts erupted originally at mid-ocean ridges are known as morb mid-ocean ridge basalt and are characteristically low in incompatible elements alkali basalts typically have mineral assemblages that lack orthopyroxene but contain olivine feldspar phenocrysts typically are labradorite to andesine in composition augite is rich in titanium compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt minerals such as alkali feldspar leucite nepheline sodalite phlogopite mica and apatite may be present in the groundmass basalt has high liquidus and solidus temperatures values at the earth s surface are near or above 1200 c liquidus and near or below 1000 c solidus these values are higher than those of other common igneous rocks the majority of tholeiitic basalts are formed at approximately 50 100 km depth within the mantle many alkali basalts may be formed at greater depths perhaps as deep as 150 200 km 12 13 the origin of high-alumina basalt continues to be controversial with disagreement over whether it is a primary melt or derived from other basalt types by fractionation 14 65 geochemistry relative to most common igneous rocks basalt compositions are rich in mgo and cao and low in sio2 and the alkali oxides i e na2o k2o consistent with the tas classification basalt generally has a composition of 45 55 wt sio2 2 6 wt total alkalis 0.5 2.0 wt tio2 5 14 wt feo and 14 wt or more al2o3 contents of cao are commonly near 10 wt those of mgo commonly in the range 5 to 12 wt high-alumina basalts have aluminium contents of 17 19 wt al2o3 boninites have magnesium contents of up to 15 percent mgo rare feldspathoid-rich mafic rocks akin to alkali basalts may have na2o k2o contents of 12 or more the abundances of the lanthanide or rare-earth elements ree can be a useful diagnostic tool to help explain the history of mineral crystallisation as the melt cooled in particular the relative abundance of europium compared to the other ree is often markedly higher or lower and called the europium anomaly it arises because eu2 can substitute for ca2 in plagioclase feldspar unlike any of the other lanthanides which tend to only form 3 cations mid-ocean ridge basalts morb and their intrusive equivalents gabbros are the characteristic igneous rocks formed at mid-ocean ridges they are tholeiitic basalts particularly low in total alkalis and in incompatible trace elements and they have relatively flat rare earth element ree patterns normalized to mantle or chondrite values in contrast alkali basalts have normalized patterns highly enriched in the light ree and with greater abundances of the ree and of other incompatible elements because morb basalt is considered a key to understanding plate tectonics its compositions have been much studied although morb compositions are distinctive relative to average compositions of basalts erupted in other environments they are not uniform for instance compositions change with position along the mid-atlantic ridge and the compositions also define different ranges in different ocean basins 15 mid-ocean ridge basalts have been subdivided into varieties such as normal nmorb and those slightly more enriched in incompatible elements emorb isotope ratios of elements such as strontium neodymium lead hafnium and osmium in basalts have been much studied to learn about the evolution of the earth s mantle isotopic ratios of noble gases such as 3he 4he are also of great value for instance ratios for basalts range from 6 to 10 for mid-ocean ridge tholeiitic basalt normalized to atmospheric values but to 15 24 and more for ocean-island basalts thought to be derived from mantle plumes source rocks for the partial melts probably include both peridotite and pyroxenite e g sobolev et al 2007 morphology and textures an active basalt lava flow the shape structure and texture of a basalt is diagnostic of how and where it erupted whether into the sea in an explosive cinder eruption or as creeping pahoehoe lava flows the classic image of hawaiian basalt eruptions subaerial eruptions basalt that erupts under open air that is subaerially forms three distinct types of lava or volcanic deposits scoria ash or cinder breccia and lava flows basalt in the tops of subaerial lava flows and cinder cones will often be highly vesiculated imparting a lightweight frothy texture to the rock basaltic cinders are often red coloured by oxidized iron from weathered iron-rich minerals such as pyroxene a types of blocky cinder and breccia flows of thick viscous basaltic lava are common in hawaii p hoehoe is a highly fluid hot form of basalt which tends to form thin aprons of molten lava which fill up hollows and sometimes forms lava lakes lava tubes are common features of pahoehoe eruptions basaltic tuff or pyroclastic rocks are rare but not unknown usually basalt is too hot and fluid to build up sufficient pressure to form explosive lava eruptions but occasionally this will happen by trapping of the lava within the volcanic throat and buildup of volcanic gases hawaii s mauna loa volcano erupted in this way in the 19th century as did mount tarawera new zealand in its violent 1886 eruption maar volcanoes are typical of small basalt tuffs formed by explosive eruption of basalt through the crust forming an apron of mixed basalt and wall rock breccia and a fan of basalt tuff further out from the volcano amygdaloidal structure is common in relict vesicles and beautifully crystallized species of zeolites quartz or calcite are frequently found columnar basalt columnar jointed basalt in turkey during the cooling of a thick lava flow contractional joints or fractures form 16 if a flow cools relatively rapidly significant contraction forces build up while a flow can shrink in the vertical dimension without fracturing it can t easily accommodate shrinking in the horizontal direction unless cracks form the extensive fracture network that develops results in the formation of columns the topology of the lateral shapes of these columns can broadly be classed as a random cellular network these structures are predominantly hexagonal in cross-section but polygons with three to twelve or more sides can be observed 17 the size of the columns depends loosely on the rate of cooling very rapid cooling may result in very small 1 cm diameter columns while slow cooling is more likely to produce large columns submarine eruptions pillow basalts on the south pacific seafloor outcrop of a pillow basalt italy pillow basalts when basalt erupts underwater or flows into the sea contact with the water quenches the surface and the lava forms a distinctive pillow shape through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow this pillow texture is very common in underwater basaltic flows and is diagnostic of an underwater eruption environment when found in ancient rocks pillows typically consist of a fine-grained core with a glassy crust and have radial jointing the size of individual pillows varies from 10 cm up to several meters when pahoehoe lava enters the sea it usually forms pillow basalts however when a a enters the ocean it forms a littoral cone a small cone-shaped accumulation of tuffaceous debris formed when the blocky a a lava enters the water and explodes from built-up steam the island of surtsey in the atlantic ocean is a basalt volcano which breached the ocean surface in 1963 the initial phase of surtsey s eruption was highly explosive as the magma was quite fluid causing the rock to be blown apart by the boiling steam to form a tuff and cinder cone this has subsequently moved to a typical pahoehoe-type behaviour volcanic glass may be present particularly as rinds on rapidly chilled surfaces of lava flows and is commonly but not exclusively associated with underwater eruptions pillow basalt is also produced by some subglacial volcanic eruptions life on basaltic rocks the common corrosion features of underwater volcanic basalt suggest that microbial activity may play a significant role in the chemical exchange between basaltic rocks and seawater the significant amounts of reduced iron fe ii and manganese mn ii present in basaltic rocks provide potential energy sources for bacteria some fe ii -oxidizing bacteria cultured from iron-sulfide surfaces are also able to grow with basaltic rock as a source of fe ii 18 fe- and mn- oxidizing bacteria have been cultured from weathered submarine basalts of loihi seamount 19 the impact of bacteria on altering the chemical composition of basaltic glass and thus the oceanic crust and seawater suggest that these interactions may lead to an application of hydrothermal vents to the origin of life distribution on earth most basalt magmas have formed by decompression melting of the mantle basalt commonly erupts on io the third largest moon of jupiter 20 and has also formed on the moon mars venus and the asteroid vesta the crustal portions of oceanic tectonic plates are composed predominantly of basalt produced from upwelling mantle below the ocean ridges paran traps brazil basalt is one of the most common rock types in the world basalt is the rock most typical of large igneous provinces the largest occurrences of basalt are in the ocean floor that is almost completely made up by basalt above sea level basalt is common in hotspot islands and around volcanic arcs specially those on thin crust however the largest volumes of basalt on land correspond to continental flood basalts continental flood basalts are known to exist in the deccan traps in india the chilcotin group in british columbia canada the paran traps in brazil the siberian traps in russia the karoo flood basalt province in south africa the columbia river plateau of washington and oregon many archipelagoes and island nations have an overwhelming majority of its exposed bedrock made up by basalt due to being above hotspots for example iceland and hawaii ancient precambrian basalts are usually only found in fold and thrust belts and are often heavily metamorphosed these are known as greenstone belts because low-grade metamorphism of basalt produces chlorite actinolite epidote and other green minerals occurrence engraving of a basalt formation from alberto fortis della valle vulcanico-marina di ronc nel territorio veronese 1778 basalt rocks near detunata goal east of bucium

bodies basalt is a common rock on all terrestrial planets mercury venus mars and the moon many meteorites have the same chemical composition as basalt lunar and martian basalt lunar olivine basalt collected by apollo 15 the dark areas visible on earth s moon the lunar maria are plains of flood basaltic lava flows these rocks were sampled by the manned american apollo program the robotic russian luna program and are represented among the lunar meteorites lunar basalts differ from their terrestrial counterparts principally in their high iron contents which typically range from about 17 to 22 wt feo they also possess a wide range of titanium concentrations present in the mineral ilmenite 25 ranging from less than 1 wt tio2 to about 13 wt traditionally lunar basalts have been classified according to their titanium content with classes being named high-ti low-ti and very-low-ti nevertheless global geochemical maps of titanium obtained from the clementine mission demonstrate that the lunar maria possess a continuum of titanium concentrations and that the highest concentrations are the least abundant lunar basalts show exotic textures and mineralogy particularly shock metamorphism lack of the oxidation typical of terrestrial basalts and a complete lack of hydration while most of the moon s basalts erupted between about 3 and 3.5 billion years ago the oldest samples are 4.2 billion years old and the youngest flows based on the age dating method of crater counting are estimated to have erupted only 1.2 billion years ago basalt is also a common rock on the surface of mars

metamorphic belts as they can provide vital information on the conditions of metamorphism within the belt metamorphosed basalts are important hosts for a variety of hydrothermal ore deposits including gold deposits copper deposits volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits and others weathering compared to other rocks found on earth s surface basalts weather relatively fast the typically iron-rich minerals oxidise rapidly in water and air staining the rock a brown to red colour due to iron oxide rust chemical weathering also releases readily water-soluble cations such as calcium sodium and magnesium which give basaltic areas a strong buffer capacity against acidification calcium released by basalts binds up co2 from the atmosphere forming caco3 acting thus as a co2 trap to this it must be added that the eruption of basalt itself is often associated with the release of large quantities of co2 into the atmosphere from volcanic gases uses basalt is used in construction e g as building blocks or in the groundwork making cobblestones from columnar basalt and in making statues heating and extruding basalt yields stone wool said to be an excellent thermal insulator carbon sequestration in basalt has been studied as a means of removing carbon dioxide produced by human industrialization from the atmosphere underwater basalt deposits scattered in seas around the globe have the added benefit of the water serving as a barrier to the re-release of co2 into the atmosphere 27 see also wikimedia commons has media related to basalt basalt fan structure basalt fiber flood basalt igneous
