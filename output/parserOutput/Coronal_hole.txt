coronal hole - wikipedia coronal hole from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search coronal holes are areas where the sun s corona is colder hence darker and has lower-density plasma than average because there is lower energy and gas levels coronal holes are part of the sun s corona and are constantly changing and reshaping because the corona is not uniform 1 the sun contains magnetic fields that arch away from areas in the corona that are very thin due to the lower levels of energy and gas 1 which cause coronal holes to appear when they do not fall back thus solar particles escape at a rate great enough to create a lower density and lower temperature in that area 2 contents 1 first discoveries 2 solar cycle 3 coronal holes and solar wind 4 influence on space weather 5 images 6 see also 7 references 8 further reading first discoveries edit in the 1960s the sydney chris cross radio telescope took x-ray images although it was unclear what they were some research also points out that coronal holes were first spotted in the early 1970s 2 3 these were found when x-ray telescopes in the skylab mission were flown above the earth s atmosphere to reveal the structure of the corona solar cycle edit coronal hole size and population correspond with the solar cycle 3 as the sun heads toward solar maximum the coronal holes move closer and closer to the sun s poles 3 during solar maximum the number of coronal holes decreases until the magnetic fields on the sun reverse afterwards new coronal holes appear near the new poles the coronal holes then increase in size and number extending farther from the poles as the sun moves toward solar minimum again 4 there are permanent coronal holes on the north and south poles of the sun 1 coronal hole magnetic field lines-image shows what happens when the field lines do not fall back and instead allow solar wind to escape coronal holes and solar wind edit coronal holes generally discharge solar wind at a speed about twice the average 3 the escaping solar wind is known to travel along open magnetic field lines that pass through the coronal hole area 4 since coronal holes are regions in the sun s corona that have much lower densities and temperatures than most of the corona these regions are very thin this thinness contributes to the solar wind since particles within the chromosphere can more easily break through influence on space weather edit during solar minima coronal holes are the primary sources of space weather disturbances typically geomagnetic and proton storms originating from coronal holes have a gradual commencement over hours and are not as severe as storms caused by coronal mass ejections cmes which usually have a sudden onset due to the fact coronal holes can last for several months it is often possible to predict the recurrence of this type of disturbance significantly farther in advance than for cme related disturbances 2 images edit the solar disk with a coronal hole play media this visualization shows a coronal hole over the course of 24 hours sampled about once per minute see also edit heliophysics list of solar storms references edit a b c freedman roger a and william j kaufmann iii our star the sun universe 8th ed new york w h freeman 2008 419 420 print a b c ips gov au a b c d nasa nasa retrieved 31 october 2014 a b fox karen nasa nasa retrieved 31 october 2014 further reading edit gombosi tamas 1998 physics of the space environment new york cambridge university press isbn 0-521-59264-x jiang y chen h shen y yang l li k 2007 january h dimming associated with the eruption of a coronal sigmoid in the quiet sun solar physics 240 1 77 87 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title coronal hole oldid 819547113 categories sun hidden categories wikipedia articles with lccn identifiers articles containing video clips navigation menu search this page was last edited on 9 january 2018 at 23 47 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
