9 notes geography and environment edit the tropic of capricorn is the dividing line between the southern temperate zone to the south and the tropics to the north the northern hemisphere equivalent of the tropic of capricorn is the tropic of cancer the position of the tropic of capricorn is not fixed but rather it varies in a complex manner over time see under circles of latitude for information in australia areas on the tropic have some of the most variable rainfall in the world 2 and thus even the wetter areas cannot be generally farmed since irrigation sources invariably dry up in drought years in southern africa where rainfall is more reliable farming is possible though yields are low even with fertilisers in south america whilst in the continental cratons soils are almost as old as in australia and southern africa the presence of the geologically young and evolving andes means that this region is on the western side of the subtropical anticyclones and thus receives warm and humid air from the atlantic ocean as a result areas in brazil adjacent to the tropic are extremely important agricultural regions producing large quantities of crops such as sugarcane and the natural rainforest vegetation has been almost entirely cleared except for a few remaining patches of atlantic forest further south in argentina the temperate grasslands of the pampas region is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world producing of wheat soybeans maize and beef making the country one of the largest worldwide agricultural exporters similar to the role played by the prairies region in canada west of the andes however the humboldt current makes conditions extremely arid creating the atacama desert one of the driest in the world so that no glaciers exist between volc n sajama at 18 30 s and cerro tres cruces at 27 s 3 vegetation here is almost non-existent though on the eastern slopes of the andes rainfall is adequate for rainfed agriculture further south in the region of patagonia shared between argentina and chile climate becomes colder with heavy snowfall in the winter months and throughout the year on the western portion of patagonia climate is more humid and dominated by fjords coniferous forests and lakes owing to the presence of thawing currents from the permafrost in the peaks of the andes mountains which divide the region this makes the region a popular destination for ski and winter sports particularly on the argentine city of bariloche and surrounding area on the eastern portion of patagonia climate is generally cold and dry steppe with high mesas and strong wind conditions the southern tip of the island of tierra del fuego and other islands of the south atlantic have sub-antarctic climate conditions around the world edit

is latin for goat horn at the december solstice in modern times the sun appears in the constellation sagittarius during this time the change is due to precession of the equinoxes the word tropic itself comes from the greek trope meaning turn change in direction or circumstances referring to the fact that the sun appears to turn back at the solstices length edit length of the tropic on 11 june
