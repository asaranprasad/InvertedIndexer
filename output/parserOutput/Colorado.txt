colorado is notable for its diverse geography which includes alpine mountains arid plains deserts with huge sand dunes and deep canyons the borders of colorado were originally defined to be lines of latitude and longitude making its shape a latitude-longitude quadrangle which stretches from 37 n to 41 n latitude and from 102 03 w to 109 03 w longitude 25 w to 32 w from the washington meridian 13

area of colorado is flat and rolling land east of the rocky mountains are the colorado eastern plains of the high plains the section of the great plains within nebraska at elevations ranging from roughly 3,350 to 7,500 feet 1,020 to 2,290 m 15 the colorado plains were mostly prairies but they have many patches of deciduous forests buttes and canyons eastern colorado is presently mainly covered in farmland and rangeland along with small farming villages and towns precipitation is fair averaging from 15 to 25 inches 380 to 640 mm annually 16 corn wheat hay soybeans and oats are all typical crops and most of the villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a grain elevator irrigation water is available from the south platte the arkansas river and a few other streams and also from subterranean sources including artesian wells however heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline as well as crop agriculture eastern colorado hosts considerable livestock such as cattle ranches and hog farms front range edit front range peaks west of denver roughly 70 of colorado s population resides along the eastern edge of the rocky mountains in the front range urban corridor between cheyenne wyoming and pueblo colorado this region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the pacific ocean region by the high rockies in the middle of colorado the front range includes denver boulder fort collins loveland colorado springs pueblo greeley and other townships and municipalities in between on the other side of the rockies the significant population centers in western colorado which is not considered the front range are the cities of grand junction durango and montrose continental divide edit continental divide at monarch pass the continental divide of the americas extends along the crest of the rocky mountains the area of colorado to the west of the continental divide is called the western slope of colorado drainage water west of the continental divide flows to the southwest via the colorado river and the green river into the gulf of california within the interior of the rocky mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins in the north on the east side of the continental divide is the north park of colorado the north park is drained by the north platte river which flows north into wyoming and nebraska just to the south of north park but on the western side of the continental divide is the middle park of colorado which is drained by the colorado river the south park of colorado is the region of the headwaters of the south platte river southern region edit the tallest dunes in north america at great sand dunes national park in southern colorado in southmost colorado is the large san luis valley where the headwaters of the rio grande are located the valley sits between the sangre de cristo mountains and san juan mountains and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains the rio grande drains due south into new mexico mexico and texas across the sangre de cristo range to the east of the san luis valley lies the wet mountain valley these basins particularly the san luis valley lie along the rio grande rift a major geological formation of the rocky mountains and its branches the high desert lands that make up the san luis valley in southern colorado peaks edit to the west of the great plains of colorado rises the eastern slope of the rocky mountains notable peaks of the rocky mountains include longs peak mount evans pikes peak and the spanish peaks near walsenburg in southern colorado this area drains to the east and the southeast ultimately either via the mississippi river or the rio grande into the gulf of mexico peaks of the san juan mountains the rocky mountains within colorado contain about 53 peaks that are 14,000 feet 4,267 m or higher in elevation above sea level known as fourteeners 17 these mountains are largely covered with trees such as conifers and aspens up to the tree line at an elevation of about 12,000 feet 3,700 m in southern colorado to about 10,500 feet 3,200 m in northern colorado above this only alpine vegetation grows only small parts of the colorado rockies are snow-covered year round much of the alpine snow melts by mid-august with the exception of a few snowcapped peaks and a few small glaciers the colorado mineral belt stretching from the san juan mountains in the southwest to boulder and central city on the front range contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of colorado mount elbert is the highest summit of the rocky mountains the 30 highest major summits of the rocky mountains of north america all lie within the state black canyon

springs colorado western slope edit the grand valley in western colorado a large valley made up of high desert terrain the city of grand junction is located in the heart of the valley the western slope of colorado is drained by the colorado river and its tributaries primarily the gunnison river green river and the san juan river or by evaporation in its arid areas the colorado river flows through glenwood canyon and then through an arid valley made up of desert from rifle to parachute through the desert canyon of de beque canyon and into the arid desert of grand valley where the city of grand junction is located also prominent in or near the southern portion of the western slope are the grand mesa which lies to the southeast of grand junction the high san juan mountains a rugged mountain range and to the west of the san juan mountains the colorado plateau a high arid region that borders southern utah the city of grand junction colorado is the largest city on the western slope grand junction and durango are the only major centers of television broadcasting west of the continental divide in colorado though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers higher education in and near the western slope can be found at colorado mesa university in grand junction western state college of colorado in gunnison fort lewis college in durango and colorado mountain college in glenwood springs and steamboat springs grand junction is located along interstate 70 the only major highway in western colorado grand junction is also along the major railroad of the western slope the union pacific this railroad also provides the tracks for amtrak s california zephyr passenger train which crosses the rocky mountains between denver and grand junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways the colorado national monument near grand junction the monument is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations the western slope lies in close proximity to multiple notable destinations in the colorado rocky mountains including glenwood springs with its resort hot springs and the ski resorts of aspen breckenridge vail crested butte steamboat springs and telluride the northwestern corner of colorado is a sparsely populated region and it contains part of the noted dinosaur national monument which is not only a paleontological area but is also a scenic area of rocky hills canyons arid desert and streambeds here the green river briefly crosses over into colorado from west to east the land of colorado consists of desert lands desert plateaus alpine mountains national forests relatively flat grasslands scattered forests buttes and canyons in the western edge of the great plains the famous pikes peak is located just west of colorado springs its isolated peak is visible from nearly the kansas border on clear days and also far to the north and the south 18 desert lands in colorado are located in and around areas such as

states in the united states that share a common geographic point the four corners together with arizona new mexico and utah at this intersection it is possible to stand in four states at once climate edit k ppen climate types of colorado the climate of colorado is more complex than states outside of the mountain states region unlike most other states southern colorado is not always warmer than northern colorado most of colorado is made up of mountains foothills high plains and desert lands mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate as a general rule with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation northeast east and southeast colorado are mostly the high plains while northern colorado is a mix of high plains foothills and mountains northwest and west colorado are predominantly mountainous with some desert lands mixed in southwest and southern colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas eastern plains edit the climate of the eastern plains is semiarid k ppen climate classification bsk with low humidity and moderate precipitation usually from 15 to 25 inches 380 to 640 millimeters annually the area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool clear nights which give this area a great average diurnal temperature range the difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds the front range urban corridor where most of the population of colorado resides lies in a pronounced precipitation shadow as a result of being on the lee side of the rocky mountains 19 in summer this area can have many days above 95 f 35 c and often 100 f 38 c 20 on the plains the winter lows usually range from 25 to 10 f 4 to 23 c about 75 of the precipitation falls within the growing season from april to september but this area is very prone to droughts most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms which can be severe and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring otherwise winters tend to be mostly dry and cold 21 in much of the region march is the snowiest month april and may are normally the rainiest months while april is the wettest month overall the front range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to chinook winds which warm the area sometimes bringing temperatures of 70 f 21 c or higher in the winter 21 the average july temperature is 55 f 13 c in the morning and 90 f 32 c in the afternoon the average january temperature is 18 f 8 c in the morning and 48 f 9 c in the afternoon although variation between consecutive days can be 40 f 20 c front range foothills edit just west of the plains and into the foothills there are a wide variety of climate types locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography most valleys have a semi-arid climate not unlike the eastern plains which transitions to an alpine climate at the highest elevations microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates including subtropical highland cfb cwb humid subtropical cfa humid continental dfa dfb mediterranean csa csb and subarctic dfc 22 extreme weather edit snow highlights the rugged mountains as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the colorado plains extreme weather changes are common in colorado although the majority of extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state thunderstorms are common east of the continental divide in the spring and summer yet are usually brief hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state the eastern plains have had some of the biggest hail storms in north america 16 the eastern plains are part of the extreme western portion of tornado alley some damaging tornadoes in the eastern plains include the 1990 limon f3 tornado and the 2008 windsor ef3 tornado which devastated the small town 23 the plains are also susceptible to occasional floods which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather notable examples include the big thompson river flooding of 1976 and the 2013 colorado floods denver s record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above 90 f 32 c was broken during the summer of 2008 the new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week 24 much of colorado is a very dry state averaging only 17 inches 430 millimeters of precipitation per year statewide and rarely experiences a time when some portion of the state is not in some degree of drought 25 the lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state such as the hayman fire one of the largest wildfires in american history and the fourmile canyon fire of 2010 which until the waldo canyon fire and high park fire of june 2012 and the black forest fire of june 2013 was the most destructive wildfire in colorado s recorded history however some of the mountainous regions of colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls the spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the yampa river the colorado river the rio grande the arkansas river the north platte river and the south platte river the yampa river from a high overlook water flowing out of the colorado rocky mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms towns and cities of the southwest states of new mexico arizona utah and nevada as well as the midwest such as nebraska and kansas and the southern states of oklahoma and texas a significant amount of water is also diverted for use in california occasionally formerly naturally and consistently the flow of water reaches northern mexico records edit the highest ambient air temperature ever recorded in colorado was 118 f 48 c on july 11 1888 at bennett the lowest air temperature was 61 f 52 c on february 1 1985 at maybell 26 27 monthly normal high and low temperatures for various colorado cities 28 f c city jan

history edit ruins of cliff palace at mesa verde national park as photographed by gustaf nordenski ld in 1891 great kiva at chimney rock in the san juan mountains of southwestern colorado it is said to have been built by the ancient pueblo peoples the region that is today the state of colorado has been inhabited by native americans for more than 13,000 years the lindenmeier site in larimer county contains artifacts dating from approximately 11200 bc to 3000 bc the eastern edge of the rocky mountains was a major migration route that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the americas the ancient pueblo peoples lived in the valleys and mesas of the colorado plateau 31 the ute nation inhabited the mountain valleys of the southern rocky mountains and the western rocky mountains even as far east as the front range of present day the apache and the comanche also inhabited eastern and southeastern parts of the state at times the arapaho nation and the cheyenne nation moved west to hunt across the high plains the u s acquired a territorial claim to the eastern rocky mountains with the louisiana purchase from france in 1803 this u s claim conflicted with the claim by spain to the upper arkansas river basin as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of santa f de nuevo m xico in 1806 zebulon pike led a u s army reconnaissance expedition into the disputed region colonel pike and his men were arrested by spanish cavalrymen in the san luis valley the following february taken to chihuahua and expelled from mexico the following july the u s relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the arkansas river and south of 42nd parallel north and west of the 100th meridian west as part of its purchase of florida from spain with the adams-on s treaty of 1819 the treaty took effect february 22 1821 having settled its border with spain the u s admitted the southeastern portion of the territory of missouri to the union as the state of missouri on august 10 1821 the remainder of missouri territory including what would become northeastern colorado became unorganized territory and remained so for 33 years over the question of slavery after 11 years of war spain finally recognized the independence of mexico with the treaty of c rdoba signed on august 24 1821 mexico eventually ratified the adams-on s treaty in 1831 the texian revolt of 1835 36 fomented a dispute between the u s and mexico which eventually erupted into the mexican american war in 1846 mexico surrendered its northern territory to the u s with the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo at the conclusion of the war in 1848 map of the mexican cession with the white representing the territory the united states received from mexico well over half of colorado was received during this treaty most american settlers traveling overland west to the oregon country namely the new goldfields of california or the new mormon settlements of the state of deseret in the salt lake valley avoided the rugged southern rocky mountains and instead followed the north platte river and sweetwater river to south pass wyoming the lowest crossing of the continental divide between the southern rocky mountains and the central rocky mountains in 1849 the mormons of the salt lake valley organized the extralegal state of deseret claiming the entire great basin and all lands drained by the rivers green grand and colorado the federal government of the u s flatly refused to recognize the new mormon government because it was theocratic and sanctioned plural marriage instead the compromise of 1850 divided the mexican cession and the northwestern claims of texas into a new state and two new territories the state of california the territory of new mexico and the territory of utah on april 9 1851 mexican american settlers from the area of taos settled the village of san luis then in the new mexico territory later to become colorado s first permanent euro-american settlement the anasazi heritage center in dolores in 1854 senator stephen a douglas persuaded the u s congress to divide the unorganized territory east of the continental divide into two new organized territories the territory of kansas and the territory of nebraska and an unorganized southern region known as the indian territory each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between free soil and pro-slavery factions the gold seekers organized the provisional government of the territory of jefferson on august 24 1859 but this new territory failed to secure approval from the congress of the united states embroiled in the debate over slavery the election of abraham lincoln for the president of the united states on november 6 1860 led to the secession of nine southern slave states and the threat of civil war among the states seeking to augment the political power of the union states the republican party-dominated congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the territory of kansas into the union as the free state of kansas on january 29 1861 leaving the western portion of the kansas territory and its gold-mining areas as unorganized territory territory act edit the territories of new mexico utah kansas and nebraska before the creation of the territory of colorado thirty days later on february 28 1861 outgoing u s president james buchanan signed an act of congress organizing the free territory of colorado 32 the original boundaries of colorado remain unchanged today the name colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the colorado river originated in the territory 33 in 1776 spanish priest silvestre v lez de escalante recorded that native americans in the area knew the river as el rio colorado for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains citation needed in 1859 a u s army topographic expedition led by captain john macomb located the confluence of the green river with the grand river in what is now canyonlands national park in utah 34 the macomb party designated the confluence as the source of the colorado river on april 12 1861 south carolina artillery opened fire on fort sumter to start the american civil war while many gold seekers held sympathies for the confederacy the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the union cause in 1862 a force of texas cavalry invaded the territory of new mexico and captured santa fe on march 10 the object of this western campaign was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of colorado and california and to seize ports on the pacific ocean for the confederacy a hastily organized force of colorado volunteers force-marched from denver city colorado territory to glorieta pass new mexico territory in an attempt to block the texans on march 28 the coloradans and local new mexico volunteers stopped the texans at the battle of glorieta pass destroyed their cannon and supply wagons and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules the texans were forced to retreat to santa fe having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in new mexico the texans abandoned santa fe and returned to san antonio in defeat the confederacy made no further attempts to seize the southwestern united states in 1864 territorial governor john evans appointed the reverend john chivington as colonel of the colorado volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from cheyenne and arapaho warriors who were accused of stealing cattle colonel chivington ordered his men to attack a band of cheyenne and arapaho encamped along sand creek chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors the militia returned to denver city in triumph but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of indians at peace that most of the dead were women and children and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated three u s army inquiries condemned the action and incoming president andrew johnson asked governor evans for his resignation but none of the perpetrators was ever punished this event is now known as the sand creek massacre mount of the holy cross

and earning it the moniker centennial state 35 the discovery of a major silver lode near leadville in 1878 triggered the colorado silver boom the sherman silver purchase act of 1890 invigorated silver mining and colorado s last but greatest gold strike at cripple creek a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers colorado women were granted the right to vote beginning on november 7 1893 making colorado the second state to grant universal suffrage and the first one by a popular vote of colorado men the repeal of the sherman silver purchase act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of colorado but the state slowly and steadily recovered between the 1880s and 1930s denver s floriculture industry developed into a major industry in colorado 36 37 this period became known locally as the carnation gold rush 38 colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the democratic party met in denver in 1908 by the u s census in 1930 the population of colorado first exceeded one million residents colorado suffered greatly through the great depression and the dust bowl of the 1930s but a major wave of immigration following world war ii boosted colorado s fortune tourism became a mainstay of the state economy and high technology became an important economic engine the united states census bureau estimated that
