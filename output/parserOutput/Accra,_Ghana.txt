19th-century suburb of victoriaborg accra has since transitioned into a modern metropolis the city s architecture reflects this history ranging from 19th-century architecture buildings to modern skyscrapers and apartment blocks 9 accra is the greater accra region s economic and administrative hub and serves as the anchor of the larger greater accra metropolitan area gama 10 which is inhabited

word nkran meaning ants a reference to the numerous anthills seen in the countryside around accra 12 the name specifically refers to soldier ants and was applied to both the town and people by the twi speakers 13 14 the name of accra in the ga language is ga or gaga the same name as that of the ga people and a cognate with nkran the word is sometimes rendered with the nasalised vowels as g or g g historian carl christian reindorf confirmed this etymology proposing a link between the martial qualities and migratory behaviour of the local ants and those of the ga people the link between the ethonym and ants was explicitly reflected in the recognition of anthills as sacred places often ringed by sacred fences aklabatsa the tall red mounds dotting accra s hinterland were seen as microcosms of human community and as nodal points between the known world and the world of the dead 13 while the ga used the reference to the invasive species of dark-brown swarming ants to connote military prowess and their ancient conquest of guang speakers residing in the accra plains the akan-speaking appropriation and translation of this metaphor had a less than generous meaning instead of viewing ga speakers as a formidable military force the akan-speaking term nkran cast ga peoples as pests or nuisances to be controlled or exterminated 15 the name ga is actually a cognate of the name akan one of a few words in which g corresponds to k in akan 16 ga also gave its name to the ga districts surrounding accra 17 the name accra was given to nkran by europeans 17 an earlier spelling used by the danes was akra 18 19 history edit a contemporary drawing of the danish empire fort fort christiansborg now osu castle the outpost to the right is fort pr vestenen the main ga group known as the tumgwa we led by ayi kushie arrived by sea when the guan lartehs on the coast saw them on their canoes at sea they looked like ants hence the lartehs refer to them as nkran ants nkran was later corrupted by the danes to akra then to present-day accra nkran in the ga language is gaga thus they also started calling themselves ga due to their sheer numbers the indigenous lartehs thus relocated to the akuapem ridge the ga are also part of the main guan group that started the initial migration from the nubia empire 20 initially accra was not the most prominent trading centre the trade hubs of the time were the ports at ada and prampram along with the inland centres of dodowa and akuse the dutch built the nearby outposts of ussher fort while the british and the swedes built james fort and christiansborg castles respectively by the 17th century portugal france and denmark had constructed forts in the city britain gradually acquired the interests of all other countries beginning in 1851 when denmark sold christiansborg which they had acquired from the swedes and their other forts to the british the netherlands was the last to sell out in 1871 in 1873 after decades of tension between the british and ashantis the british attacked and virtually destroyed kumasi the british then captured accra in 1874 and in 1877 at the end of the second anglo-asante war accra replaced cape coast as the capital of the british gold coast this decision was made because accra had a drier climate relative to cape coast until this time the settlement of accra was confined between ussher fort to the east and the korle lagoon to the west 21 as the newly established gold coast s administrative functions were moved to accra 1877 an influx of british colonial administrator and settlers grew around the christiansborg modern osu ministries ridge labone and cantonments began and the city began to expand to accommodate the new residents victoriaborg was formed in the late 19th century as an exclusively european residential neighbourhood located to the east of the city limits of the time the boundaries of accra were further stretched in 1908 this expansion entailed the creation of a native-only neighbourhood intended to accommodate members of the native population as a means of relieving congestion problems in the overcrowded city centre adabraka was thus established to the north of the city 22 a main street of central accra sometime between 1885 and 1908 one of the most influential decisions in the history of the city was that of building the accra-kumasi railway in 1908 this was to connect accra the country s foremost port at that time with ghana s main cocoa-producing regions in 1923 the railway was completed and by 1924 cocoa was ghana s largest export the british gold coast heavily influenced the shape that accra during this period for example racial segregation of neighbourhoods was mandated by law until 1923 and all new buildings were required to be built out of stone or concrete despite these regulations british settlers of the gold coast were very hesitant to invest any large amount of money into the city to maintain its infrastructure or improve public works this did not change until the governorship of sir frederick gordon guggisberg during which period the three separate settlements osu la and jamestown merged to become modern accra guggisberg s administration laid out the present grid networked neighborhoods of tudu adabraka and asylum down among the achievements of guggisberg was the building of a bridge across the korle lagoon in 1923 which opened the land west of the lagoon for settlement guggisberg also oversaw the building of a major hospital korle-bu and secondary school achimota such improvements led to an increase in accra s population due to the migration of rural dwellers into the city and the immigration of increasing numbers of british businessmen and administrators after world war ii edit jamestown lighthouse in jamestown usshertown in the years following world war ii the neighbourhoods of ridge and cantonments were planned as low-density developments for europeans while many rural migrants settled in neighbourhoods which had not yet been incorporated into accra s municipal boundary such as nima and surrounding areas thus the development of these neighbourhoods was unregulated by the government creating a crowded and jumbled shanty-town landscape another area of accra that took shape at this time was the central business district cbd more administrative buildings were built on high street forming a massive judicial administrative complex additionally the expansion of the economy led to many more commercial buildings being built in the cbd in 1944 accra s city planner maxwell fry devised a town plan which was revised in 1958 by b d w treavallion and alan flood although the fry trevallion plan was never followed through it illustrated the british vision of how accra should develop fry treavallion plan edit in the fry treavallion plan a reorganisation of the cbd was called for as well as the development of the coastal region of the city to reorganise the cbd the planners decided to superimpose a tight street grid north of fort ussher to the east of this newly organised cbd the planners hoped to preserve a broad open space for a restaurant country club and polo and cricket fields additionally the british planners intended to build large numbers of public squares fountains and ornamental pools and statues throughout the city as well as a vast parliament complex in the city centre lastly the fry treavallion plan included plans to make the coastal region an extension of the exclusive european neighbourhood of victoriaborg and to create a recreational preserve for the elite however the british gold coast ended before the fry treavallion plan was enacted nkrumah plan edit when kwame nkrumah became ghana s first postindependence prime minister in 1957 he created his own plan for accra s development instead of creating spaces to serve the elite nkrumah sought to create spaces to inspire pride and nationalism in his people and people throughout africa rather than creating ornamental fountains and a large parliament complex nkrumah decided to build landmarks such as independence square the state house and the organisation of african unity building and to refurbish christianborg castle nkrumah decided to leave the atlantic coastal region undeveloped so as to not detract attention from the community centre or independence square lending both spaces symbolic significance the nkrumah plan did not emphasise order nearly as much as the fry treavallion plan did whereas the british plan strove to lessen crowding in the commercial district and help relieve the overcrowding of neighbourhoods bordering the cbd the nkrumah plan allowed for continued compression of commercial establishments into the cbd as well as increased migration into jamestown present-day accra edit the modern city is centred on the original british danish and dutch forts and their surrounding communities jamestown near the british james fort osu near the danish fort of christiansborg now osu castle and ussherstown near the dutch ussher fort tourist attractions include the national museum of ghana the ghana academy of arts and sciences the national archives

borders on a hot semi-arid climate bsh the average annual rainfall is about 730 mm which falls primarily during ghana s two rainy seasons the chief rainy season begins in april and ends in mid-july whilst a weaker second rainy season occurs in october rain usually falls in short intensive storms and causes local flooding in which drainage channels are obstructed very little variation in temperature occurs throughout the year the mean monthly temperature ranges from 25.9 c 78.6 f in august the coolest to 29.6 c 85.3 f in march the hottest with an annual average of 27.6 c 81.7 f the cooler months tend to be more humid than the warmer months as a result during the warmer months and particularly during the windy harmattan season the city experiences a breezy dry heat that feels less warm than the cooler but more humid rainy season as a coastal city accra is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise with population growth putting increasing pressure on the coastal areas 25 drainage infrastructure is particularly at risk which has profound implications for people s livelihoods especially in informal settlements inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement as well as perceived corruption in government processes lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government co-ordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of accra s drainage infrastructure according to the climate development knowledge network 26 as accra is close to the equator the daylight hours are practically uniform during the year relative humidity is generally high varying from 65 in the midafternoon to 95 at night the predominant wind direction in accra is from the wsw to nne sectors wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16 km h high wind gusts occur with thunderstorms which generally pass in squalls along the coast the maximum wind speed record in accra is 107.4 km h 58 knots strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material several areas of accra experience microclimatic effects low-profile drainage basins with a north-south orientation are not as well ventilated as those oriented east-west air is often trapped in pockets over the city and an insulation effect can give rise to a local increase in air

rural-urban migration to the city and consequently a high population growth rate 34 the stagnation of the ghanaian economy during the 1970s slowed the growth of accra s population as shown by the falling growth rate of the 1970 1984 intercensal years later however the decline in agriculture in rural communities in ghana and rising industrialisation in urban regions coupled with the late-1980s boom in the service sector once again propelled immigration to accra the primacy of the accra metropolitan area as the greater accra region s administrative educational industrial and commercial centre continues to be the major force for its population growth with immigration contributing to over 35 of the accra s population growth national mosque distribution and density edit the gross density of population for the accra metropolitan area in 2000 was 10.03 persons per hectare compared to 6.23 per hectare in 1970 the highest densities were recorded in the accra metropolitan assembly

such as accra new town nima jamestown and usshertown in higher-income areas densities ranged between 17.5 and 40 persons per hectare population distribution by age and gender edit accra s population is a very youthful one with 56 of the population being under 24 years of age this predominance of young people is not expected to decline in the foreseeable future fifty-one percent 51 of the population are females and the remaining 49 males this gives a males-to-females ratio of 1 1.04 the greater number of females is a reflection of the nationwide trend where the estimated ratio of males to females is 1 1.03 migration edit decentralisation is expected to reduce the migration rates in accra an assessment of the extent of migration to accra based on present locality and gender reveals that 45 of residents in accra are african immigrants from countries across the african continent housing edit parts of central accra comprise a mixture of very low-density development with under-used service infrastructure on the one hand high-density development and overstretched infrastructure services on the other the growth of accra has led to the neglect of some of the old settlements whilst efforts are being made to provide the newly developing suburban areas with services and infrastructure to cater for the needs of the middle-income earners peripheral residential development in accra barely has sufficient infrastructure to support it there are also large numbers of uncompleted houses interspersed with pockets of undeveloped land which are often subject of litigation due to the
