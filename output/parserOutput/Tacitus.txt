120 ad was a senator and a historian of the roman empire the surviving portions of his two major works the annals and the histories examine the reigns of the roman emperors tiberius claudius nero and those who reigned in the year of the four emperors 69 ad these two works span the history of the roman empire from the death of augustus in 14 ad to the years of the first jewish roman war in 70 ad there are substantial lacunae in the surviving texts including a gap in the annals that is four books long tacitus other writings discuss oratory in dialogue format see dialogus de oratoribus germania in de origine et situ germanorum and the life of his father-in-law agricola the roman general responsible for much of the roman conquest of britain mainly focusing on his campaign in britannia de vita et moribus iulii agricolae tacitus is considered to be one of the greatest roman historians 1 2 he lived in what has been called the silver age of latin literature and is known for the brevity and compactness of his latin prose as well as for his penetrating insights into the psychology of power politics contents 1 life 1.1 family and early life 1.2 public life marriage and literary career 2

are scarce what little is known comes from scattered hints throughout his work the letters of his friend and admirer pliny the younger and an inscription found at mylasa in caria 3 tacitus was born in 56 or 57 to an equestrian family 4 like many latin authors of both the golden and silver ages he was from the provinces probably northern italy or gallia narbonensis the exact place and date of his birth are not known and his praenomen first name is also unknown in the letters of sidonius apollinaris his name is gaius but in the major surviving manuscript of his work his name is given as publius 5 one scholar s suggestion of sextus has gained no approval 6 family and early life edit tacitus was probably born in gallia narbonensis most of the older aristocratic families failed to survive the proscriptions which took place at the end of the republic and tacitus makes it clear that he owed his rank to the flavian emperors hist the claim that he was descended from a freedman is derived from a speech in his writings which asserts that many senators and knights were descended from freedmen ann but this is generally disputed 7 his father may have been the cornelius tacitus who served as procurator of belgica and germania pliny the elder mentions that cornelius had a son who aged rapidly n h which implies an early death there is no mention of tacitus suffering such a condition but it is possible that this refers to a brother if cornelius was indeed his father 8 the friendship between the younger pliny and tacitus leads some scholars to conclude that they were both the offspring of wealthy provincial families 9 the province of his birth remains unknown though various conjectures suggest gallia belgica gallia narbonensis or northern italy 10 his marriage to the daughter of narbonensian senator gnaeus julius agricola implies that he came from gallia narbonensis tacitus dedication to lucius fabius justus in the dialogus may indicate a connection with spain and his friendship with pliny suggests origins in northern italy 11 no evidence exists however that pliny s friends from northern italy knew tacitus nor do pliny s letters hint that the two men had a common background 12 pliny book 9 letter 23 reports that when he was asked if he was italian or provincial he gave an unclear answer and so was asked if he was tacitus or pliny since pliny was from italy some infer that tacitus was from the provinces probably gallia narbonensis 13 his ancestry his skill in oratory and his sympathetic depiction of barbarians who resisted roman rule e g ann have led some to suggest that he was a celt this belief stems from the fact that the celts who had occupied gaul prior to the roman invasion were famous for their skill in oratory and had been subjugated by rome 14 public life marriage and literary career edit as a young man tacitus studied rhetoric in rome to prepare for a career in law and politics like pliny he may have studied under quintilian 15 c 35 ad c 100 in 77 or 78 he married julia agricola daughter of the famous general agricola 16 little is known of their domestic life save that tacitus loved hunting and the outdoors 17 he started his career probably the latus clavus mark of the senator 18 under vespasian 19 reigned 69-79 but entered political life as a quaestor in 81 or 82 under titus 20 he advanced steadily through the cursus honorum becoming praetor in 88 and a quindecimvir a member of the priestly college in charge of the sibylline books and the secular games 21 he gained acclaim as a lawyer and as an orator his skill in public speaking ironically counterpoints his cognomen tacitus silent he served in the provinces from c 89 to c 93 either in command of a legion or in a civilian post 22 he and his property survived domitian s reign of terror 81 96 but the experience left him jaded and perhaps ashamed at his own complicity giving him the hatred of tyranny evident in his works 23 the agricola chs is illustrative agricola was spared those later years during which domitian leaving now no interval or breathing space of time but as it were with one continuous blow drained the life-blood of the commonwealth it was not long before our hands dragged helvidius to prison before we gazed on the dying looks of manricus and rusticus before we were steeped in senecio s innocent blood even nero turned his eyes away and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered with domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen to know that our sighs were being recorded from his seat in the senate he became suffect consul in 97 during the reign of nerva being the first of his family to do so during his tenure he reached the height of his fame as an orator when he delivered the funeral oration for the famous veteran soldier lucius verginius rufus 24 in the following year he wrote and published the agricola and germania foreshadowing the literary endeavors that would occupy him until his death 25 afterwards he absented himself from public life but returned during trajan s reign 98-117 in 100 he and his friend pliny the younger prosecuted marius priscus proconsul of africa for corruption priscus was found guilty and sent into exile pliny wrote a few days later that tacitus had spoken with all the majesty which characterizes his usual style of oratory 26 a lengthy absence from politics and law followed while he wrote the histories and the annals in 112 or 113 he held the highest civilian governorship that of the roman province of asia in western anatolia recorded in the inscription found at mylasa mentioned above a passage in the annals fixes 116 as the terminus post quem of his death which may have been as late as 125 or even 130 it seems that he survived both pliny died c 113 and trajan died 117 27 it remains unknown whether tacitus had any children the augustan history reports that emperor marcus claudius tacitus reigned 275-276 claimed him for an ancestor and provided for the preservation of his works but this story may be fraudulent like much of the augustan history 28 works edit the title page of justus lipsius s 1598 edition of the complete works of tacitus bearing the stamps of the bibliotheca comunale in empoli italy five works ascribed to tacitus have survived albeit with lacunae the most substantial of which are the annals and the histories this canon with approximate dates consists of 98 de vita iulii agricolae the life of agricola 98 de origine et situ germanorum germania 102 dialogus de oratoribus dialogue on oratory 105 historiae histories 117 ab excessu divi augusti annals history of the roman empire from the death of augustus edit the annals and the histories published separately were meant to form a single edition of thirty books 29 although tacitus wrote the histories before the annals the events in the annals precede the histories together they form a continuous narrative from the death of augustus 14 to the death of domitian 96 though most has been lost what remains is an invaluable record of the era the first half of the annals survived in a single copy of a manuscript from corvey abbey and the second half from a single copy of a manuscript from monte cassino and so it is remarkable that they survived at all the histories edit in an early chapter of the agricola tacitus asserts that he wishes to speak about the years of domitian nerva and trajan in the histories the scope has changed tacitus says that he will deal with the age of nerva and trajan at a later time instead he will cover the period from the civil wars of the year of four emperors and end with the despotism of the flavians only the first four books and twenty-six chapters of the fifth book survive covering the year 69 and the first part of 70 the work is believed to have continued up to the death of domitian on september 18 96 the fifth book contains as a prelude to the account of titus s suppression of the great jewish revolt a short ethnographic survey of the ancient jews and it is an invaluable record of roman attitudes towards them the annals edit the annals tacitus final work covers the period from the death of augustus caesar in 14 ad he wrote at least sixteen books but books 7 10 and parts of books 5 6 11 and 16 are missing book 6 ends with the death of tiberius and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of caligula and claudius the remaining books cover the reign of nero perhaps until his death in june 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the histories the second half of book 16 is missing ending with the events of 66 we do not know whether tacitus completed the work he died before he could complete his planned histories of nerva and trajan and no record survives of the work on augustus caesar and the beginnings of the roman empire with which he had planned to finish his work the annals is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention christ which tacitus does in connection with nero s persecution of the christians annals 15.44 in the second medicean manuscript monographs edit tacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope agricola a biography of his father-in-law gnaeus julius agricola the germania a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian germania and the dialogus a dialogue on the art of rhetoric germania edit the germania latin title de origine et situ germanorum is an ethnographic work on the germanic tribes outside the roman empire the germania fits within a classical ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as herodotus and julius caesar the book begins chapters 1 27 with a description of the lands laws and customs of the various tribes later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes beginning with those who lived closest to the roman empire and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the baltic sea such as the fenni tacitus had written a similar albeit shorter piece in his agricola chapters 10 13 agricola de vita et moribus iulii agricolae edit the agricola written c 98 recounts the life of gnaeus julius agricola an eminent roman general and tacitus father-in-law it also covers briefly the geography and ethnography of ancient britain as in the germania tacitus favorably contrasts the liberty of the native britons with the tyranny and corruption of the empire the book also contains eloquent polemics against the greed of rome one of which that tacitus claims is from a speech by calgacus ends by asserting that auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium atque ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant to ravage to slaughter to usurp under false titles they call empire and where they make a desert they call it peace oxford revised translation dialogus edit the style of the dialogus follows cicero s models for latin rhetoric there is uncertainty about when tacitus wrote dialogus de oratoribus many characteristics set it apart from the other works of tacitus so that its authenticity has at various times been questioned it is likely to be early work indebted to the author s rhetorical training since its style imitates that of the foremost roman orator cicero it lacks for example the incongruities that are typical of his mature historical works the dialogus is dedicated to fabius iustus a consul in 102 ad sources edit tacitus makes use of the official sources of the roman state the acta senatus the minutes of the session of the senate and the acta diurna populi romani a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital he also read collections of emperors speeches such as tiberius and claudius he is generally seen as a scrupulous historian who paid careful attention to his sources the minor inaccuracies in the annals may be due to tacitus dying before he had finished and therefore proof-read his work tacitus cites some of his sources directly among them cluvius rufus fabius rusticus and pliny the elder who had written bella germaniae and a historical work which was the continuation of that of aufidius bassus tacitus also uses collections of letters epistolarium he also took information from exitus illustrium virorum these were a collection of books by those who were antithetical to the emperors they tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom especially the men who committed suicide while he places no value on the stoic theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide for example cremutius cordus speech in ann iv 34-35 literary style edit tacitus s writings are known for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries such as plutarch when he writes about a near-defeat of the roman army in ann i 63 he does so with brevity of description rather than embellishment in most of his writings he keeps to a chronological narrative order only seldom outlining the bigger picture leaving the reader to construct that picture for himself nonetheless where he does use broad strokes for example in the opening paragraphs of the annals he uses a few condensed phrases which take the reader to the heart of the story approach to history edit tacitus s historical style owes some debt to sallust his historiography offers penetrating often pessimistic insights into the psychology of power politics blending straightforward descriptions of events moral lessons and tightly focused dramatic accounts tacitus s own declaration regarding his approach to history ann i,1 is well known inde consilium mihi tradere sine ira et studio quorum causas procul habeo my purpose is to relate without either anger or zeal motives from which i am far removed there has been much scholarly discussion about tacitus neutrality throughout his writing he is preoccupied with the balance of power between the senate and the emperors and the increasing corruption of the governing classes of rome as they adjusted to the ever-growing wealth and power of the empire in tacitus s view senators squandered their cultural inheritance that of free speech to placate their rarely benign emperor tacitus noted the increasing dependence of the emperor on the goodwill of his armies the julio-claudians eventually gave way to generals who followed julius caesar and sulla and pompey in recognizing that military might could secure them the political power in rome hist welcome as the death of nero had been in the first burst of joy yet it had not only roused various emotions in rome among the senators the people or the soldiery of the capital it had also excited all the legions and their generals for now had been divulged that secret of the empire that emperors could be made elsewhere than at rome tacitus s political career was largely lived out under the emperor domitian his experience of the tyranny corruption and decadence of that era 81 96 may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis he draws our attention to the dangers of power without accountability love of power untempered by principle and the apathy and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the empire nonetheless the image he builds of tiberius throughout the first six books of the annals is neither exclusively bleak nor approving most scholars view the image of tiberius as predominantly positive in the first books and predominantly negative after the intrigues of sejanus the entrance of tiberius in the first chapters of the first book is dominated by the hypocrisy of the new emperor and his courtiers in the later books some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position in general tacitus does not fear to praise and to criticize the same person often noting what he takes to be their more-admirable and less-admirable properties one of tacitus s hallmarks is refraining from conclusively taking sides for or against persons he describes which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system see tacitean studies black vs red tacitists prose style edit his latin style is highly praised 30 his style although it has a grandeur and eloquence thanks to tacitus s education in rhetoric is extremely concise even epigrammatic the sentences are rarely flowing or beautiful but their point is always clear the style has been both derided as harsh unpleasant and thorny and praised as grave concise and pithily eloquent a passage of annals 1.1 where tacitus laments the state of the historiography regarding the four last emperors of the julio-claudian dynasty illustrates his style the histories of tiberius gaius claudius and nero while they were in power were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred 31 or in a word-by-word translation tiberii gaique et claudii ac neronis res florentibus ipsis ob metum falsae postquam occiderant recentibus odiis compositae sunt tiberius gaius and claudius as well as nero s acts while flourishing themselves out of fear counterfeited after they came to fall resulting from new-found hate related are interpunction and linebreaks added for clarity compared to the ciceronian period where sentences were usually the length of a paragraph and artfully constructed with nested pairs of carefully matched sonorous phrases this is short and to the point but it is also very individual note the three different ways of saying and in the first line -que et ac and especially the matched second and third lines they are parallel in sense but not in sound the pairs of words ending -entibus -is are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the ciceronian conventions which one would however need to be acquainted with to see the novelty of tacitus style some readers then and now find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating others find the deliberate discord playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines stimulating and intriguing 32 his historical works focus on the inner motivations of the characters often with penetrating insight though it is questionable how much of his insight is correct and how much is convincing only because of his rhetorical skill 33 he is at his best when exposing hypocrisy and dissimulation for example he follows a narrative recounting tiberius refusal of the title pater patriae by recalling the institution of a law forbidding any treasonous speech or writings and the frivolous prosecutions which resulted annals 1.72 elsewhere annals 4.64 66 he compares tiberius s public distribution of fire relief to his failure to stop the perversions and abuses of justice which he had begun although this kind of insight has earned him praise he has also been criticised for ignoring the larger context tacitus owes most both in language and in method to sallust and ammianus marcellinus is the later historian whose work most closely approaches him in style studies and reception history edit from pliny the younger s 33 auguror nec me fallit augurium historias tuas immortales futuras i predict and my predictions do not fail me that your histories will be immortal the historian was not much read in late antiquity and even less in the middle ages only a third of his known work has survived we depend on a single manuscript for books i-vi of the annales and on another one for the other surviving half books xi-xvi and for the five books extant of the historiae 34 his antipathy towards the jews and christians of his time he records with unemotional contempt the sufferings of the christians at rome during nero s persecution made him unpopular in the middle ages he was rediscovered however by the renaissance whose writers were impressed with his dramatic presentation of the imperial age tacitus has been described as the greatest historian that the roman world produced 35 encyclop dia britannica opines that he ranks beyond dispute in the highest place among men of letters of all ages his work has been read for its moral instruction for its dramatic narrative and for its prose style 36 outside the field of history tacitus influence is most prominent in the area of political theory 36 the political lessons taken from his work fall roughly into two camps as identified by giuseppe toffanin the red tacitists use him to support republican ideals and the black tacitists read him as a lesson in machiavellian realpolitik 37 although his work is our most reliable source for the history of his era its factual accuracy is occasionally questioned the annals are based in part on secondary sources and there are some obvious mistakes for instance the confusion of the two daughters of mark antony and octavia minor who are both called antonia 38 the histories however are written from primary documents and intimate knowledge of the flavian period and are therefore thought to be more accurate editions edit damon cynthia 2003 tacitus histories book i cambridge greek and latin
