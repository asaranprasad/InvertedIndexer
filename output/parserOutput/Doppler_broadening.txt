doppler broadening - wikipedia doppler broadening from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in atomic physics doppler broadening is the broadening of spectral lines due to the doppler effect caused by a distribution of velocities of atoms or molecules different velocities of the emitting particles result in different doppler shifts the cumulative effect of which is the line broadening 1 this resulting line profile is known as a doppler profile a particular case is the thermal doppler broadening due to the thermal motion of the particles then the broadening depends only on the frequency of the spectral line the mass of the emitting particles and their temperature and therefore can be used for inferring the temperature of an emitting body saturated absorption spectroscopy also known as doppler-free spectroscopy can be used to find the true frequency of an atomic transition without cooling a sample down to temperatures at which the doppler broadening is minimal contents 1 derivation 2 applications and caveats 3 see also 4 references derivation edit when thermal motion causes a particle to move towards the observer the emitted radiation will be shifted to a higher frequency likewise when the emitter moves away the frequency will be lowered for non-relativistic thermal velocities the doppler shift in frequency will be f f 0 1 v c displaystyle f f 0 left 1 frac v c right where f displaystyle f is the observed frequency f 0 displaystyle f 0 is the rest frequency v displaystyle v is the velocity of the emitter towards the observer and c displaystyle c is the speed of light since there is a distribution of speeds both toward and away from the observer in any volume element of the radiating body the net effect will be to broaden the observed line if p v v d v displaystyle p v v dv is the fraction of particles with velocity component v displaystyle v to v d v displaystyle v dv along a line of sight then the corresponding distribution of the frequencies is p f f d f p v v f d v d f d f displaystyle p f f df p v v f frac dv df df where v f c f f 0 1 displaystyle v f c left frac f f 0 -1 right is the velocity towards the observer corresponding to the shift of the rest frequency f 0 displaystyle f 0 to f displaystyle f therefore p f f d f c f 0 p v c f f 0 1 d f displaystyle p f f df frac c f 0 p v left c left frac f f 0 -1 right right df we can also express the broadening in terms of the wavelength displaystyle lambda recalling that in the non-relativistic limit 0 0 f f 0 f 0 displaystyle frac lambda -
