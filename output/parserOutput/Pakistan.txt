stone tools have been found in the soan valley of punjab 54 the indus region which covers most of present day pakistan was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the neolithic mehrgarh 55 and the bronze age indus valley civilisation 56 57 58 59 60 2,800 1,800 bce at harappa and mohenjo-daro 61 62 standing buddha from gandhara the vedic civilisation 1500 500 bce characterised by indo-aryan culture during this period the vedas the oldest scriptures associated with hinduism were composed and this culture later became well established in the region 63 64 multan was an important hindu pilgrimage centre 65 the vedic civilisation flourished in the ancient gandh ran city of tak a il now taxila in the punjab which was founded around 1000 bce 66 55 successive ancient empires and kingdoms ruled the region the persian achaemenid empire around 519 bce alexander the great s empire in 326 bce 67 and the maurya empire founded by chandragupta maurya and extended by ashoka the great until 185 bce 55 the indo-greek kingdom founded by demetrius of bactria 180 165 bce included gandhara and punjab and reached its greatest extent under menander 165 150 bce prospering the greco-buddhist culture in the region 55 68 taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher education in the world which was established during the late vedic period in 6th century bce 69 70 the school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was provided on an individualistic basis 70 the ancient university was documented by the invading forces of alexander the great the like of which had not been seen in greece and was also recorded by chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century ce 71 72 73 74 at its zenith the rai dynasty 489 632 ce of sindh ruled this region and the surrounding territories 75 the pala dynasty was the last buddhist empire which under dharmapala and devapala stretched across south asia from what is now bangladesh through northern india to pakistan the arab conqueror muhammad bin qasim conquered sindh in 711 ce 76 77 78 79 80 the pakistan government s official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of pakistan was laid 76 81 82 but the concept of pakistan came in 19th century the early medieval period 642 1219 ce witnessed the spread of islam in the region during this period sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional buddhist and hindu population to islam 83 these developments set the stage for the rule of several successive muslim empires in the region including the ghaznavid empire 975 1187 ce the ghorid kingdom and the delhi sultanate 1206 1526 ce the lodi dynasty the last of the delhi sultanate was replaced by the mughal empire 1526 1857 ce badshahi mosque lahore the mughals introduced persian literature and high culture establishing the roots of indo-persian culture in the region 84 from the region of modern-day pakistan key cities during the mughal rule were lahore and thatta 85 both of which were chosen as the site of impressive mughal buildings 86 in the early 16th century the region remained under the mughal empire ruled by muslim emperors 87 by the early 18th century increasing european influence contributed to the slow disintegration of the empire as the lines between commercial and political dominance became increasingly blurred 87 during this time the english east india company had established coastal outposts 87 control over the seas greater resources technology and british military protection led the company to increasingly flex its military muscle allowing the company to gain control over the subcontinent by 1765 and sideline european competitors 88 expanding access beyond bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of region by the 1820s 87 many historians see this as the start of the region s colonial period 87 by this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the british parliament and itself effectively made an arm of british administration the company began more deliberately to enter non-economic arenas such as education social reform and culture 87 such reforms included the enforcement of the english education act in 1835 and the introduction of the indian civil service ics 89 traditional madrasahs primary institutions of higher learning for muslims in the subcontinent were no longer supported by the english crown and nearly all of the madrasahs lost their financial endowment 90 colonial period sir syed ahmad khan 1817 1898 whose vision formed the basis of pakistan muhammad ali jinnah 1876 1948 served as pakistan s first governor-general and the leader of the pakistan movement the gradual decline of the mughal empire in the early 18th century enabled the sikh empire to control larger areas until the british east india company gained ascendancy over the indian subcontinent 91 a rebellion in 1857 called the sepoy mutiny was the region s major armed struggle against the british empire and queen victoria 92 divergence in the relationship between hinduism and islam created a major rift in british india that led to racially motivated religious violence in india 93 the language controversy further escalated the tensions between hindus and muslims 94 the hindu renaissance witnessed an awakening of intellectualism in traditional hinduism and saw the emergence of more assertive influence in the social and political spheres in british india 95 96 an intellectual movement to counter the hindu renaissance was led by sir syed ahmad khan who helped found the all-india muslim league in 1901 and envisioned as well as advocated for the two-nation theory 91 in contrast to the indian congress s anti-british efforts the muslim league was a pro-british movement whose political program inherited the british values that would shape pakistan s future civil society 97 in events during world war i british intelligence foiled an anti-english conspiracy involving the nexus of congress and the german empire citation needed the largely non-violent independence struggle led by the indian congress engaged millions of protesters in mass campaigns of civil disobedience in the 1920s and 1930s against the british empire 98 99 100 over 10 million people were uprooted from their homeland and travelled on foot bullock carts and trains to their promised new home during the partition of india during the partition between 200,000 to 2,000,000 people were killed in the retributive genocide 101 the muslim league slowly rose to mass popularity in the 1930s amid fears of under-representation and neglect of muslims in politics in his presidential address of 29 december 1930 allama iqbal called for the amalgamation of north-west muslim-majority indian states consisting of punjab north-west frontier province sindh and balochistan 102 the perceived neglect of muslim interests by congress led provincial governments during the period of 1937 39 convinced muhammad ali jinnah the founder of pakistan to espouse the two-nation theory and led the muslim league to adopt the lahore resolution of 1940 popularly known as the pakistan resolution 91 in world war ii jinnah and british-educated founding fathers in the muslim league supported the united kingdom s war efforts countering opposition against it whilst working towards sir syed s vision 103 pakistan movement the 1946 elections resulted in the muslim league winning 90 percent of the seats reserved for muslims thus the 1946 election was effectively a plebiscite in which the indian muslims were to vote on the creation of pakistan a plebiscite won by the muslim league 104 this victory was assisted by the support given to the muslim league by the support of the landowners of sindh and punjab the congress which initially denied the muslim league s claim of being the sole representative of indian muslims was now forced to recognise the fact 104 the british had no alternative except to take jinnah s views into account as he had emerged as the sole spokesperson of india s muslims however the british did not want india to be partitioned and in one last effort to prevent it they devised the cabinet mission plan 105 as the cabinet mission failed the british government announced its intention to end the british raj in india in 1946 47 106 nationalists in british india including jawaharlal nehru and abul kalam azad of congress jinnah of the all-india muslim league and master tara singh representing the sikhs agreed to the proposed terms of transfer of power and independence in june 1947 with the viceroy of india lord mountbatten of burma 107 as the united kingdom agreed to the partitioning of india in 1947 the modern state of pakistan was established on 14 august 1947 27th of ramadan in 1366 of the islamic calendar amalgamating the muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of british india 100 it comprised the provinces of balochistan east bengal the north-west frontier province west punjab and sindh 91 107 in the riots that accompanied the partition in punjab province it is believed that between 200,000 and 2,000,000 108 109 110 111 112 113 people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions 114 115 while 50,000 muslim women were abducted and raped by hindu and sikh men and 33,000 hindu and sikh women also experienced the same fate at the hands of muslims 116 117 118 119 around 6.5 million muslims moved from india to west pakistan and 4.7 million hindus and sikhs moved from west pakistan to india 120 it was the largest mass migration in human history 121 122 123 dispute over jammu and kashmir led to the first kashmir war in 1948 124 125 independence and modern pakistan play media the american cia film on pakistan made in 1950 examines the history and geography of pakistan you are free you are free to go to your temples you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place or worship in this state of pakistan you may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the state muhammad ali jinnah s first speech to the constituent assembly of pakistan 126 after independence in 1947 jinnah the president of the muslim league became the nation s first governor-general as well as the first president-speaker of the parliament 127 but he died of tuberculosis on 11 september 1948 128 meanwhile pakistan s founding fathers agreed to appoint liaquat ali khan the secretary-general of the party the nation s first prime minister with dominion status in the commonwealth of nations independent pakistan had two british monarchs before it became a republic 127 the creation of pakistan was never fully accepted by many british leaders among them lord mountbatten 129 mountbatten clearly expressed his lack of support and faith in the muslim league s idea of pakistan 130 jinnah refused mountbatten s offer to serve as governor-general of pakistan 131 when mountbatten was asked by collins and lapierre if he would have sabotaged pakistan had he known that jinnah was dying of tuberculosis he replied most probably 132 maulana shabbir ahmad usmani a respected deobandi alim scholar who occupied the position of shaykh al-islam in pakistan in 1949 and maulana mawdudi of jamaat-i-islami played a pivotal role in the demand for an islamic constitution mawdudi demanded that the constituent assembly make an explicit declaration affirming the supreme sovereignty of god and the supremacy of the shariah in pakistan 133 a significant result of the efforts of the jamaat-i-islami and the ulama was the passage of the objectives resolution in march 1949 the objectives resolution which liaquat ali khan called the second most important step in pakistan s history declared that sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to god almighty alone and the authority which he has delegated to the state of pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by him is a sacred trust the objectives resolution has been incorporated as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956 1962 and 1973 134 democracy was stalled by the martial law that had been enforced by president iskander mirza who was replaced by army chief general ayub khan after adopting a presidential system in 1962 the country experienced exceptional growth until a second war with india in 1965 that led to an economic downturn and wide-scale public disapproval in 1967 135 136 consolidating control from ayub khan in 1969 president yahya khan had to deal with a devastating cyclone that caused 500,000 deaths in east pakistan 137 signing of the tashkent declaration to end hostilities with india in 1965 in tashkent ussr by president ayub alongside bhutto centre and aziz ahmed left in 1970 pakistan held its first democratic elections since independence meant to mark a transition from military rule to democracy but after the east pakistani awami league won against the pakistan peoples party ppp yahya khan and the military establishment refused to hand over power 138 139 operation searchlight a military crackdown on the bengali nationalist movement led to a declaration of independence and the waging of a war of liberation by the bengali mukti bahini forces in east pakistan 139 140 however in west pakistan the conflict was described as a civil war as opposed to a war of liberation 141 independent researchers estimate that between 300,000 and 500,000 civilians died during this period while the bangladesh government puts the number of dead at three million 142 a figure that is now nearly universally regarded as excessively inflated 143 some academics such as rudolph rummel and rounaq jahan say both sides 144 committed genocide others such as richard sisson and leo e rose believe there was no genocide 145 in response to india s support for the insurgency in east pakistan preemptive strikes on india by pakistan s air force navy and marines sparked a conventional war in 1971 that resulted in an indian victory and east pakistan gaining independence as bangladesh 139 with pakistan surrendering in the war yahya khan was replaced by zulfikar ali bhutto as president the country worked towards promulgating its constitution and putting the country on the road to democracy democratic rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 an era of self-consciousness intellectual leftism nationalism and nationwide reconstruction 146 in 1972 pakistan embarked on an ambitious plan to develop its nuclear deterrence capability with the goal of preventing any foreign invasion the country s first nuclear power plant was inaugurated in that same year 147 148 accelerated in response to india s first nuclear test in 1974 this crash program was completed in 1979 148 democracy ended with a military coup in 1977 against the leftist ppp which saw general zia-ul-haq become the president in 1978 from 1977 to 1988 president zia s corporatisation and economic islamisation initiatives led to pakistan becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in south asia 149 while building up the country s nuclear program increasing islamisation 150 and the rise of a homegrown conservative philosophy pakistan helped subsidise and distribute us resources to factions of the mujahideen against the ussr s intervention in communist afghanistan 151 152 pakistan s north-west frontier province became a base for the anti-soviet afghan fighters with the province s influential deobandi ulama playing a significant role in encouraging and organising the jihad 153 president zia died in a plane crash in 1988 and benazir bhutto daughter of zulfikar ali bhutto was elected as the country s first female prime minister the ppp was followed by conservative pakistan muslim league n and over the next decade the leaders of the two parties fought for power alternating in office while the country s situation worsened economic indicators fell sharply in contrast to the 1980s this period is marked by prolonged stagflation instability corruption nationalism geopolitical rivalry with india and the clash of left wing-right wing ideologies 154 155 as pml n secured a supermajority in elections in 1997 sharif authorised nuclear testings see chagai-i and chagai-ii as a retaliation to the second nuclear tests ordered by india led by prime minister atal bihari vajpayee in may 1998 156 president george w bush meets with president musharraf in islamabad during his 2006 visit to pakistan military tension between the two countries in the kargil district led to the kargil war of 1999 and turmoil in civic-military relations allowed general pervez musharraf to take over through a bloodless coup d tat 157 158 musharraf governed pakistan as chief executive from 1999 to 2001 and as president from 2001 to 2008 a period of enlightenment social liberalism extensive economic reforms 159 and direct involvement in the us-led war on terrorism when the national assembly historically completed its first full five-year term on 15 november 2007 the new elections were called by the election commission 160 after the assassination of benazir bhutto in 2007 the ppp secured the most votes in the elections of 2008 appointing party member yousaf raza gillani as prime minister 161 threatened with impeachment president musharraf resigned on 18 august 2008 and was succeeded by asif ali zardari 162 163 164 clashes with the judicature prompted gillani s disqualification from the parliament and as the prime minister in june 2012 165 by its own financial calculations pakistan s involvement in the war on terrorism has cost up to 118 billion 166 sixty thousand casualties and more than 1.8 million displaced civilians 167 the general election held in 2013 saw the pml n almost achieve a supermajority following which nawaz sharif was elected as the prime minister returning to the post for the third time in fourteen years in a democratic transition 168 role of islam in pakistan the idea of pakistan which had received overwhelming popular support among indian muslims especially those in the provinces of british india where muslims were in a minority such as the united provinces 169 was articulated in terms of an islamic state by the muslim league leadership the ulama islamic clergy and jinnah 170 jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama and upon his death was described by one such alim maulana shabbir ahmad usmani as the greatest muslim after aurangzeb and as someone who desired to unite the muslims of the world under the banner of islam 171 172 the objectives resolution in march 1949 which declared god as the sole sovereign over the entire universe represented the first formal step to transform pakistan into an islamic state 173 134 muslim league leader chaudhry khaliquzzaman asserted that pakistan could only truly become an islamic state after bringing all believers of islam into a single political unit 174 keith callard one of the earliest scholars on pakistani politics observed that pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the muslim world and assumed that muslim from other countries would share their views on the relationship between religion and nationality 175 however pakistan s pan-islamist sentiments for a united islamic bloc called islamistan were not shared by other muslim governments 176 although islamists such as the grand mufti of palestine al-haj amin al-husseini and leaders of the muslim brotherhood became drawn to the country pakistan s desire for an international organization of muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the organization of islamic conference oic was formed 177 the strongest opposition to the islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the state came from the bengali muslims of east pakistan 178 whose educated class according to a survey by social scientist nasim ahmad jawed preferred secularism and focused on ethnic identity unlike educated west pakistanis who tended to prefer an islamic identity 179 the islamist party jamaat-e-islami considered pakistan to be an islamic state and believed bengali nationalism to be unacceptable in the 1971 conflict over east pakistan the jamaat-e-islami fought the bengali nationalists on the pakistan army s side 180 after pakistan s first ever general elections the 1973 constitution was created by an elected parliament 181 the constitution declared pakistan an islamic republic and islam as the state religion it also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of islam as laid down in the quran and sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted 29 the 1973 constitution also created certain institutions such as the shariat court and the council of islamic ideology to channel the interpretation and application of islam 182 pakistan s leftist prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto faced vigorous opposition which coalesced into a movement united under the revivalist banner of nizam-e-mustafa rule of the prophet 183 which aimed to establish an islamic state based on sharia laws bhutto agreed to some islamist demands before being overthrown in a coup 184 after taking power from bhutto in a coup de tat general zia-ul-haq who came from a religious background 185 committed himself to establishing an islamic state and enforcing sharia law 184 zia established separate shariat judicial courts 186 and court benches 187 188 to judge legal cases using islamic doctrine 189 zia bolstered the influence of the ulama islamic clergy and the islamic parties 189 zia-ul-haq forged a strong alliance between the military and deobandi institutions 190 and even though most barelvi ulama 191 and only a few deobandi scholars had supported pakistan s creation islamic state politics came to be mostly in favour of deobandi and later ahl-e-hadith salafi institutions instead of barelvi 192 sectarian tensions increased with zia s anti-shia policies 193 according to a pew opinion poll a majority of pakistanis support making sharia the official law of the land 194 in a survey of several muslim countries the pew research centre also found that pakistanis tend to identify with their religion more than their nationality in contrast to muslims in other nations such as egypt indonesia and jordan 195 geography

are within the eurasian plate mainly on the iranian plateau gilgit baltistan and azad kashmir lie along the edge of the indian plate and hence are prone to violent earthquakes this region has the highest rates of seismicity and largest earthquakes in the himalaya region 201 ranging from the coastal areas of the south to the glaciated mountains of the north pakistan s landscapes vary from

integrity and on the cultivation of close relations with other muslim countries 231 the kashmir conflict remains the major point of contention between pakistan and india three of their four wars were fought over this territory 232 due partly to difficulties in relations with its geopolitical rival india pakistan maintains close political relations with turkey and iran 233 and both countries have been a focal point in pakistan s foreign policy 233 saudi arabia also maintains a respected position in pakistan s foreign policy a non-signatory party of the treaty on nuclear non-proliferation

of the united states on the issue of counter-terrorism in the regions of the middle east and south asia with the us supporting pakistan with aid money and weapons 251 252 initially the united states-led war on terrorism led to an improvement in the relationship but it was strained by a divergence of interests and resulting mistrust during the war in afghanistan and by issues related to terrorism 253 254 255 256 pakistan does not have diplomatic relations with israel 257 nonetheless some israeli citizens have visited the country on tourist visas 258 however an exchange took place

leadership in efforts to achieve unity 271 the ali brothers had sought to project pakistan as the natural leader of the islamic world in part due to its large manpower and military strength 272 a top-ranking muslim league leader khaliquzzaman declared that pakistan would bring together all muslim countries into islamistan a pan-islamic entity 273 such developments along with pakistan s creation did not get american approval and british prime minister clement attlee voiced international opinion at the time by stating that he wished that india and pakistan would re-unite 274 since

a pakistani attempt to dominate other muslim states 276 pakistan vigorously championed the right of self-determination for muslims around the world pakistan s efforts for the independence movements of indonesia algeria tunisia morocco and eritrea were significant and initially led to close ties between these countries and pakistan 277 however pakistan also masterminded an attack on the afghan city

afghanistan and central asia 278 on the other hand pakistan s relations with iran have been strained at times due to sectarian tensions 279 iran and saudi arabia used pakistan as a battleground for

tensions between iran and pakistan intensified in 1998 when iran accused pakistan of war crimes after pakistani warplanes had bombarded afghanistan s last shia stronghold in support of the taliban 281

vote to join pakistan and no indian government responsible for agreeing to plebiscite would survive 303 pakistan claims that its position is for the right of the people of jammu and kashmir to determine their future through impartial elections as mandated by the united nations 304 while india has stated that kashmir is an integral part of india referring to the simla agreement 1972 and to
