is a nasa explorers program solar and space exploration mission to study matter comprising energetic particles from the solar wind the interplanetary medium and other sources real-time data from ace is used by the noaa space weather prediction center to improve forecasts and warnings of solar storms 1 the ace robotic spacecraft was launched august 25 1997 and entered a lissajous orbit close to the l1 lagrangian point which lies between the sun and the earth at a distance of some 1.5 million km from the latter on december 12 1997 2 the spacecraft is currently operating at that orbit because ace is in a non-keplerian orbit and has regular station-keeping maneuvers the orbital parameters in the adjacent information box are only approximate as of 2017 the spacecraft is still in generally good condition and is projected to have enough propellant to maintain its orbit until 2024 3 nasa goddard space flight center managed the development and integration of the ace spacecraft 4 contents 1

ace 4 follow-on space weather observatory 5 see also 6 references 7 external links science objectives edit ace observations allow the investigation of a wide range of fundamental problems in the following four major areas 5 elemental and isotopic composition of matter edit a major objective is the accurate and comprehensive determination of the elemental and isotopic composition of the various samples of source material from which nuclei are accelerated these observations have been used to generate a set of solar isotopic abundances based on direct sampling of solar material determine the coronal elemental and isotopic composition with greatly improved accuracy establish the pattern of isotopic differences between galactic cosmic ray and solar system matter measure the elemental and isotopic abundances of interstellar and interplanetary pick up ions determine the isotopic composition of the anomalous cosmic ray component which represents a sample of the local interstellar medium origin of the elements and subsequent evolutionary processing edit isotopic anomalies in meteorites indicate that the solar system was not homogeneous when formed similarly the galaxy is neither uniform in space nor constant in time due to continuous stellar nucleosynthesis ace measurements have been used to search for differences between the isotopic composition of solar and meteoritic material determine the contributions of solar wind and solar energetic particles to lunar and meteoritic material and to planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres determine the dominant nucleosynthetic processes that contribute to cosmic ray source material determine whether cosmic rays are a sample of freshly synthesized material e g from supernovae or of the contemporary interstellar medium search for isotopic patterns in solar and galactic material as a test of galactic evolution models formation of the solar corona and acceleration of the solar wind edit solar energetic particle solar wind and spectroscopic observations show that the elemental composition of the corona is differentiated from that of the photosphere although the processes by which this occurs and by which the solar wind is subsequently accelerated are poorly understood the detailed composition and charge state data provided by ace are used to isolate the dominant coronal formation processes by comparing a broad range of coronal and photospheric abundances study plasma conditions at the source of solar wind and solar energetic particles by measuring and comparing the charge states of these two populations study solar wind acceleration processes and any charge or mass dependent fractionation in various types of solar wind flows particle acceleration and transport in nature edit particle acceleration is ubiquitous in nature and understanding its nature is one of the fundamental problems of space plasma astrophysics the unique data set obtained by ace measurements have been used to make direct measurements of charge and or mass dependent fractionation during solar energetic particle and interplanetary acceleration events constrain solar flare coronal shock and interplanetary shock acceleration models with charge mass and spectral data spanning up to five decades in energy test theoretical models for 3he rich flares and solar ray events instrumentation edit cosmic ray isotope spectrometer cris edit the cosmic ray isotope spectrometer covers the highest decade of the advanced composition explorer s energy interval from 50 to 500 mev nucleon with isotopic resolution for elements from z 2 to 30 the nuclei detected in this energy interval are predominantly cosmic rays originating in our galaxy this sample of galactic matter investigates the nucleosynthesis of the parent material as well as fractionation acceleration and transport processes that these particles undergo in the galaxy and in the interplanetary medium charge and mass identification with cris is based on multiple measurements of de dx and total energy in stacks of silicon detectors and trajectory measurements in a scintillating optical fiber trajectory soft hodoscope the instrument has a geometrical factor of 250 cm2 sr for isotope measurements 6 solar isotope spectrometer sis edit the solar isotope spectrometer sis provides high resolution measurements of the isotopic composition of energetic nuclei from he to zn z 2 to 30 over the energy range from 10 to 100 mev nucleon during large solar events sis measures the isotopic abundances of solar energetic particles to determine directly the composition of the solar corona and to study particle acceleration processes during solar quiet times sis measures the isotopes of low-energy cosmic rays from the galaxy and isotopes of the anomalous cosmic ray component which originates in the nearby interstellar medium sis has two telescopes composed of silicon solid-state detectors that provide measurements of the nuclear charge mass and kinetic energy of incident nuclei within each telescope particle trajectories are measured with a pair of two-dimensional silicon strip detectors instrumented with custom very-large- scale integrated vlsi electronics to provide both position and energy-loss measurements sis was especially designed to achieve excellent mass resolution under the extreme high flux conditions encountered in large solar particle events it provides a geometry factor of 40 cm2 sr significantly greater than earlier solar particle isotope spectrometers 7 ultra low energy isotope spectrometer uleis edit the ultra low energy isotope spectrometer uleis on the ace spacecraft is an ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometer that measures particle composition and energy spectra of elements he ni with energies from 45 kev nucleon to a few mev nucleon uleis investigates particles accelerated in solar energetic particle events interplanetary shocks and at the solar wind termination shock by determining energy spectra mass composition and their temporal variations in conjunction with other ace instruments uleis greatly improves our knowledge of solar abundances as well as other reservoirs such as the local interstellar medium uleis combines the high sensitivity required to measure low particle fluxes along with the capability to operate in the largest solar particle or interplanetary shock events in addition to detailed information for individual ions uleis features a wide range of count rates for different ions and energies that allows accurate determination of particle fluxes and anisotropies over short few minutes time scales 8 solar energetic particle ionic charge analyzer sepica edit the solar energetic particle ionic charge analyzer sepica was the instrument on the advanced composition explorer ace that determined the ionic charge states of solar and interplanetary energetic particles in the energy range from 0.2 mev nucl-1 to 5 mev charge-1 the charge state of energetic ions contains key information to unravel source temperatures acceleration fractionation and transport processes for these particle populations sepica had the ability to resolve individual charge states with a substantially larger geometric factor than its predecessor ulezeq on isee-1 and -3 on which sepica was based to achieve these two requirements at the same time sepica was composed of one high-charge resolution sensor section and two low- charge resolution but large geometric factor sections 9 as of 2008 this instrument is no longer functioning due to failed gas valves 3 solar wind ions mass spectrometer swims and solar wind ion composition spectrometer swics edit the solar wind ion composition spectrometer swics and the solar wind ions mass spectrometer swims on ace are instruments optimized for measurements of the chemical and isotopic composition of solar and interstellar matter swics determined uniquely the chemical and ionic-charge composition of the solar wind the thermal and mean speeds of all major solar wind ions from h through fe at all solar wind speeds above 300 km s 1 protons and 170 km s 1 fe 16 and resolved h and he isotopes of both solar and interstellar sources swics also measured the distribution functions of both the interstellar cloud and dust cloud pickup ions up to energies of 100 kev e 1 swims measures the chemical isotopic and charge state composition of the solar wind for every element between he and ni each of the two instruments are time-of-flight mass spectrometers and use electrostatic analysis followed by the time-of-flight and as required an energy measurement 10 11 on 23 august 2011 the swics time-of-flight electronics experienced an age- and radiation-induced hardware anomaly that increased the level of background in the composition data to mitigate the effects of this background the model for identifying ions in the data was adjusted to take advantage of only the ion energy-per-charge as measured by the electrostatic analyzer and the ion energy as measured by solid state detectors this has allowed swics to continue to deliver a subset of the data products that were provided to the public prior to the hardware anomaly including ion charge state ratios of oxygen and carbon and measurements of solar wind iron the measurements of proton density speed and thermal speed by swics were not affected by this anomaly and continue to the present day 3 electron proton and alpha-particle monitor epam edit the electron proton and alpha monitor epam instrument on the ace spacecraft is designed to measure a broad range of energetic particles over nearly the full unit-sphere at high time resolution such measurements of ions and electrons in the range of a few tens of kev to several mev are essential to understand the dynamics of solar flares co-rotating interaction regions cir s interplanetary shock acceleration and upstream terrestrial events the large dynamic range of epam extends from about 50 kev to 5 mev for ions and 40 kev to about 350 kev for electrons to complement its electron and ion measurements epam is also equipped with a composition aperture ca which unambiguously identifies ion species reported as species group rates and or individual pulse-height events the instrument achieves its large spatial coverage through five telescopes oriented at various angles to the spacecraft spin axis the low-energy particle measurements obtained as time resolutions between 1.5 and 24 s and the ability of the instrument to observe particle anisotropies in three dimensions make epam an excellent resource to provide the interplanetary context for studies using other instruments on the ace spacecraft 12 solar wind electron proton and alpha monitor swepam edit the solar wind electron proton alpha monitor swepam experiment provides the bulk solar wind observations for the advanced composition explorer ace these observations provide the context for elemental and isotopic composition measurements made on ace as well as allowing the direct examination of numerous solar wind phenomena such as coronal mass ejection interplanetary shocks and solar wind fine structure with advanced 3-d plasma instrumentation they also provide an ideal data set for both heliospheric and magnetospheric multi-spacecraft studies where they can be used in conjunction with other simultaneous observations from spacecraft such as ulysses the swepam observations are made simultaneously with independent electron swepam-e and ion swepam-i instruments in order to save costs for the ace project swepam-e and swepam-i are the recycled flight spares from the joint nasa esa ulysses mission both instruments had selective refurbishment modification and modernization required to meet the ace mission and spacecraft requirements both incorporate electrostatic analyzers whose fan-shaped fields of view sweep out all pertinent look directions as the spacecraft spins 13 magnetometer mag edit the magnetic field experiment on ace provides continuous measurements of the local magnetic field in the interplanetary medium these measurements are essential in the interpretation of simultaneous ace observations of energetic and thermal particles distributions the experiment consists of a pair of twin boom- mounted triaxial fluxgate sensors which are located 165 inches 4.19 m from the center of the spacecraft on opposing solar panels the two triaxial sensors provide a balanced fully redundant vector instrument and permit some enhanced assessment of the spacecraft s magnetic field 14 ace real time solar wind rtsw edit the advanced composition explorer ace rtsw system is continuously monitoring the solar wind and producing warnings of impending major geomagnetic activity up to one hour in advance warnings and alerts issued by noaa allow those with systems sensitive to such activity to take preventative action the rtsw system gathers solar wind and energetic particle data at high time resolution from four ace instruments mag swepam epam and sis packs the data into a low-rate bit stream and broadcasts the data continuously nasa sends real-time data to noaa each day when downloading science data with a combination of dedicated ground stations crl in japan and ral in great britain and time on existing ground tracking networks nasa s dsn and the usaf s afscn the rtsw system can receive data 24 hours per day throughout the year the raw data are immediately sent from the ground station to the space weather prediction center in boulder colorado processed and then delivered to its space weather operations center where they are used in daily operations the data are also delivered to the crl regional warning center at hiraiso japan to the usaf 55th space weather squadron and placed on the world wide web the data are downloaded processed and dispersed within 5 min from the time they leave ace the rtsw system also uses the low-energy energetic particles to warn of approaching interplanetary shocks and to help monitor the flux of high-energy particles that can produce radiation damage in satellite systems 15 science results edit the spectra of particles observed by ace edit oxygen fluences observed by ace the figure shows the particle fluence total flux over a given period of time of oxygen at ace for a time period just after solar minimum the part of the 11-year solar cycle when solar activity is lowest 16 the lowest-energy particles come from the slow and fast solar wind with speeds from about 300 to about 800 kilometers per second like the solar wind distribution of all ions that of oxygen has a suprathermal tail of higher-energy particles that is in the frame of the bulk solar wind the plasma has an energy distribution that is approximately a thermal distribution but has a notable excess above about 5 kiloelectron volts as shown in figure 1 the ace team has made contributions to understanding the origins of these tails and their role in injecting particles into additional acceleration processes at energies higher than those of the solar wind particles ace observes particles from regions known as corotating interaction regions cirs cirs form because the solar wind is not uniform due to solar rotation high-speed streams collide with preceding slow solar wind creating shock waves at roughly 2 5 astronomical units au the distance between earth and the sun and forming cirs particles accelerated by these shocks are commonly observed at 1 au below energies of about 10 megaelectron volts per nucleon ace measurements confirm that cirs include a significant fraction of singly charged helium formed when interstellar neutral helium is ionized 17 at yet higher energies the major contribution to the measured flux of particles is due to solar energetic particles seps associated with interplanetary ip shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections cmes and solar flares enriched abundances of helium-3 and helium ions show that the suprathermal tails are the main seed population for these seps 18 ip shocks traveling at speeds up to about 2000 kilometers per second accelerate particles from the suprathermal tail to 100 megaelectron volts per nucleon and more ip shocks are particularly important because they can continue to accelerate particles as they pass over ace and thus allow shock acceleration processes to be studied in situ other high-energy particles observed by ace are anomalous cosmic rays acrs that originate with neutral interstellar atoms that are ionized in the inner heliosphere to make pickup ions and are later accelerated to energies greater than 10 megaelectron volts per nucleon in the outer heliosphere ace also observes pickup ions directly they are easily identified because they are singly charged finally the highest-energy particles observed by ace are the galactic cosmic rays gcrs thought to be accelerated by shock waves from supernova explosions in our galaxy other findings from ace edit shortly after launch the sep sensors on ace detected solar events that had unexpected characteristics unlike most large shock-accelerated sep events these were highly enriched in iron and helium-3 as are the much smaller flare-associated impulsive sep events 19 20 within the first year of operations ace found many of these hybrid events which led to substantial discussion within the community as to what conditions could generate them 21 one remarkable recent discovery in heliospheric physics has been the ubiquitous presence of suprathermal particles with common spectral shape this shape unexpectedly occurs in the quiet solar wind in disturbed conditions downstream from shocks including cirs and elsewhere in the heliosphere these observations have led fisk and gloeckler 22 to suggest a novel mechanism for the particles acceleration another discovery has been that the current solar cycle as measured by sunspots cmes and seps has been much less magnetically active than the previous cycle mccomas et al 23 have shown that the dynamic pressures of the solar wind measured by the ulysses satellite over all latitudes and by ace in the ecliptic plane are correlated and were declining in time for about 2 decades they concluded that the sun had been undergoing global change that affected the overall heliosphere simultaneously gcr intensities were increasing and in 2009 were the highest recorded during the past 50 years 24 gcrs have more difficulty reaching earth when the sun is more magnetically active so the high gcr intensity in 2009 is consistent with a globally reduced dynamic pressure of the solar wind ace also measures abundances of cosmic ray nickel-59 and cobalt-59 isotopes these measurements indicate that a time longer than the half-life of nickel-59 with bound electrons 7.6 104 years elapsed between the time nickel-59 was created in a supernova explosion and the time cosmic rays were accelerated 25 such long delays indicate that cosmic rays come from the acceleration of old stellar or interstellar material rather than from fresh supernova ejecta ace also measures an iron-58 iron-56 ratio that is enriched over the same ratio in solar system material 26 these and other findings have led to a theory of the origin of cosmic rays in galactic superbubbles formed in regions where many supernovae explode within a few million years recent observations of a cocoon of freshly accelerated cosmic rays in the cygnus superbubble by the fermi gamma-ray observatory 27 support this theory follow-on space weather observatory edit on february 11 2015 the deep space climate observatory dscovr with several similar instruments including a newer and more sensitive instrument to detect earth-bound coronal mass ejections successfully launched by noaa and nasa aboard a spacex falcon 9 launch vehicle from cape canaveral florida the spacecraft arrived at l1 by 8 june 2015 just over 100 days after launch 28 along with ace both will provide space weather data as long as ace can continue to function 29 see also edit heliophysics cluster spacecraft helios
