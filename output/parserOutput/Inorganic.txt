template message a chemical compound is termed inorganic if it fulfills one or more of the following criteria most of them do not contain carbon it cannot be found or incorporated into a living organism there is no clear or universally agreed-upon distinction between organic and inorganic compounds organic chemists traditionally and generally refer to any molecule containing carbon as an organic compound and by default this means that inorganic chemistry deals with molecules lacking carbon 1 2 as many minerals are of biological origin biologists may distinguish organic from inorganic compounds in a different way that does not hinge on the presence of a carbon atom pools of organic matter for example that have been metabolically incorporated into living tissues persist in decomposing tissues but as molecules become oxidized into the open environment such as atmospheric co2 this creates a separate pool of inorganic compounds the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac an agency widely recognized for defining chemical terms does not offer definitions of inorganic or organic compounds hence the definition for an inorganic versus an organic compound in a multidisciplinary context spans the division between organic life living or animate and inorganic non-living or inanimate matter 3 in broader speech the term commonly referred to compounds

considered the starting point of modern organic chemistry 4 the w hler synthesis is of great historical significance because for the first time an organic compound was produced from inorganic reactants this finding went against the mainstream theory of that time called vitalism which stated that organic matter possessed a special force or vital force inherent to all things living for this reason a sharp boundary existed between organic and inorganic compounds urea was discovered in 1799 and could until 1828 only be obtained from biological sources such as urine citation needed w hler reported to his mentor berzelius i cannot so to say hold my chemical water and must tell you that i can make urea without thereby needing to have kidneys or anyhow an animal be it human or dog citation needed modern usage edit inorganic compounds can be defined as any compound that is not organic compound some simple compounds which contain carbon are usually considered inorganic these include carbon monoxide carbon dioxide carbonates cyanides cyanates carbides and thiocyanates many of these are normal parts of mostly organic systems including organisms which means that describing a chemical as inorganic does not obligately mean that it does not occur within living things in contrast methane and formic acid are generally considered to be simple examples of organic compounds although the inorganic crystal structure database icsd 5 in its definition of inorganic carbon compounds states that such compounds may contain either c-h or c-c bonds but not both 6 coordination chemistry edit a large class of compounds discussed in inorganic chemistry textbooks are coordination compounds examples range from substances that are strictly inorganic such as co nh3 6 cl3 to organometallic compounds such as fe c5h5 2 and extending to bioinorganic compounds such as the hydrogenase enzymes mineralogy edit minerals are mainly oxides and sulfides which are strictly inorganic although they may be of biological origin in fact most of the earth is inorganic although the components of earth s crust are well-elucidated the processes of mineralization and the composition of the deep mantle remain active areas of investigation which are covered mainly in geology-oriented venues 7 see also edit inorganic compounds by element list of inorganic compounds list of named inorganic
