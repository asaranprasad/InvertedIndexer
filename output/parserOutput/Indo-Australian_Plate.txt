indo-australian plate - wikipedia indo-australian plate from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in orange and red is the indo-australian plate shown as divided between the indian plate and the australian plate the indo-australian plate is a major tectonic plate that includes the continent of australia and surrounding ocean and extends northwest to include the indian subcontinent and adjacent waters it was formed by the fusion of indian and australian plates approximately 43 million years ago 1 recent studies and evidence from seismic events such as the 2012 indian ocean earthquakes suggest that the indo-australian plate may have broken up into two or three separate plates due primarily to stresses induced by the collision of the indo-australian plate with eurasia along what later became the himalayas 2 3 and that the indian plate and australian plate have been separate since at least million years ago 4 the eastern part australia is moving northward at the rate of 5.6 cm 2.2 in per year while the western part india is moving only at the rate of 3.7 cm 1.5 in per year due to the impediment of the himalayas this differential movement has resulted in the compression of the former plate near its center at sumatra and the division into the indian and australian plates 5 6 7 a third plate known as the capricorn plate may also be separating off the western side of the indian plate as part of the continued breakup of the indo-australian plate 8 references edit r r hillis r d m ller evolution and dynamics of the australian plate stein seth sella giovanni f okai emile a 2002 pdf american geophysical union doi retrieved 2015-12-25 phys org 2012-09-26 retrieved 2012-10-06 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title indo-australian plate oldid 828362421 categories tectonic plates geology of australia geology of india geology of new zealand new guinea geology of the pacific ocean geology of the indian ocean geology of indonesia navigation menu search this page was last edited on 2 march 2018 at 02 43 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
