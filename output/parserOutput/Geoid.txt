utm v t the geoid is the shape that the surface of the oceans would take under the influence of earth s gravity and rotation alone in the absence of other influences such as winds and tides this surface is extended through the continents such as with very narrow hypothetical canals all points on a geoid surface have the same effective potential the sum of gravitational potential energy and centrifugal potential energy the geoid can be defined at any value of gravitational potential such as within the earth s crust or far out in space not just at sea level the force of gravity acts everywhere perpendicular to the geoid meaning that plumb lines point perpendicular and water levels parallel to the geoid if only gravity and rotational acceleration were at work specifically the geoid is the equipotential surface that would coincide with the mean ocean surface of earth if the oceans and atmosphere were in equilibrium at rest relative to the rotating earth 1 and extended through the continents such as with very narrow canals according to gauss who first described it it is the mathematical figure of earth a smooth but highly irregular surface whose shape results from the uneven distribution of mass within and on the surface of earth it does not correspond to the actual surface of earth s crust but to a surface which can only be known through extensive gravitational measurements and calculations despite being an important concept for almost two hundred years in the history of geodesy and geophysics it has only been defined to high precision since advances in satellite geodesy in the late 20th century it is often described as the true physical figure of the earth 1 in contrast to the idealized geometrical figure of a reference ellipsoid the surface of the geoid is higher than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a positive gravity anomaly mass excess and lower than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a negative gravity anomaly

plumb line 4 continent 5 geoid the geoid surface is irregular unlike the reference ellipsoid which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical earth but considerably smoother than earth s physical surface although the physical earth has excursions of 8,848 m mount everest and 11,034 m marianas trench the geoid s variation ranges from 85 m iceland to 106 m southern india less than 200 m total 4 compared to a perfect mathematical ellipsoid if the ocean surface were isopycnic of constant density and undisturbed by tides currents or weather it would closely approximate the geoid the permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography if the continental land masses were criss-crossed by a series of tunnels or canals the sea level in these canals would also very nearly coincide with the geoid in reality the geoid does not have a physical meaning under the continents but geodesists are able to derive the heights of continental points above this imaginary yet physically defined surface by a technique called spirit leveling being an equipotential surface the geoid is by definition a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular this means that when traveling by ship one does not notice the undulations of the geoid the local vertical plumb line is always perpendicular to the geoid and the local horizon tangential to it likewise spirit levels will always be parallel to the geoid on a long voyage spirit leveling indicates height variations even though the ship is always at sea level neglecting the effects of tides this is because gps satellites orbiting about the center of gravity of the earth can only measure heights relative to a geocentric reference ellipsoid to obtain one s geoidal height a raw gps reading must be corrected conversely height determined by spirit leveling from a tidal measurement station as in traditional land surveying will always be geoidal height modern gps receivers have a grid implemented inside where they obtain the geoid e g egm-96 height over the world geodetic system wgs ellipsoid from the current position then they are able to correct the height above wgs ellipsoid to the height above wgs84 geoid when height is not zero on a ship the discrepancy is due to other factors such as ocean tides atmospheric pressure meteorological effects and local sea surface topography simplified example edit the gravitational field of the earth is neither perfect nor uniform a flattened ellipsoid is typically used as the idealized earth but even if the earth were perfectly spherical the strength of gravity would not be the same everywhere because density and therefore mass varies throughout the planet this is due to magma distributions mountain ranges deep sea trenches and so on if that perfect sphere were then covered in water the water would not be the same height everywhere instead the water level would be higher or lower depending on the particular strength of gravity in that location spherical harmonics representation edit spherical harmonics are often used to approximate the shape of the geoid the current best such set of spherical harmonic coefficients is egm96 earth gravity model 1996 5 determined in an international collaborative project led by nima the mathematical description of the non-rotating part of the potential

number of coefficients c n m displaystyle overline c nm and s n m displaystyle overline s nm can be determined by first observing in the equation for v that for a specific value of n there are two coefficients for every value of m except for m 0 there is only one coefficient when m 0 since sin 0 0 displaystyle sin 0 lambda 0 there are thus 2n 1 coefficients for every value of n using these

enables millimetre-to-centimetre accuracy in geoid computation an order-of-magnitude improvement from previous classical solutions 10 11 12 13 causes for geoid anomalies edit gravity and geoid anomalies caused by various crustal and lithospheric thickness changes relative to a reference configuration all settings are under local isostatic compensation variations in the height of the geoidal surface are related to density anomalous distributions within the earth geoid measures help thus to understand the internal structure of the planet synthetic calculations show that the geoidal signature of a thickened crust for example in orogenic belts produced by continental collision is positive opposite to what should be expected if the thickening affects the entire lithosphere time-variability edit recent satellite missions such as goce and grace have enabled the study of time-variable geoid signals the first products based on goce satellite data became available online in june 2010 through the european space agency esa s earth observation user services tools 14 15 esa launched the satellite in march 2009 on a mission to map earth s gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution on 31 march 2011 the new geoid model was unveiled at the fourth international goce user workshop hosted at the technische universit t m nchen in munich germany 16 studies using the time-variable geoid computed from grace data have provided information on global hydrologic cycles 17 mass balances of ice sheets 18 and postglacial rebound 19 from postglacial rebound measurements time-variable grace data can be used to deduce the viscosity of earth s mantle 20 celestial bodies edit this section needs expansion you can help by june 2014 the concept of the geoid has been extended to other planets and also moons 21 as well as asteroids citation needed the geoid of mars has been measured using flight paths of satellite missions such as mariner 9 and viking the main
