and political activist in the kadet party met with vladimir lenin to discuss the future of the academy they agreed that the expertise of the academy would be applied to addressing questions of state construction while in return the soviet regime would give the academy financial and political support the most important activities of the academy in the 1920s included an investigation of the large kursk magnetic anomaly of the minerals in the kola peninsula and participation in the goelro plan targeted electrification of the whole country in these years many research institutons were established and the number of scientists became four times larger than in 1917 in 1925 the soviet government recognized the russian academy of sciences as the highest all-union scientific institution and renamed it the academy of sciences of the ussr in 1934 the academy headquarters moved from leningrad to the capital moscow the stalin years are marked with a rapid industrialisation of the soviet union for which a great deal of research mainly in the technical fields has been done however on the other hand in these very times many scientists underwent repressions from ideological reasons in the years of the second world war the soviet academy of sciences made a big contribution to a development of modern weapons tanks new series of t-34 airplanes degaussing the ships for protection against the naval mines etc and therefore to victory of the ussr over the nazi germany during and after the war the academy was involved in the soviet atomic bomb project due to its success and other achievements in military techniques the ussr became one of the superpowers in the cold war era at the end-1940th the academy consisted of eight divisions physico-mathematical science chemical sciences geological-geographical sciences biological science technical science history and philosophy economics and law literature and languages three committees one for coordinating the scientific work of the academies of the republics one for scientific and technical propaganda and one for editorial and publications two commissions for publishing popular scientific literature and for museums and archives a laboratory for scientific photography and cinematography and academy of science press departments external to the divisions 15 the academy of sciences of the ussr helped to establish national academies of sciences in all soviet republics with the exception of the russian sfsr in many cases delegating prominent scientists to live and work in other republics in the case of the ukraine its academy was formed by the local ukrainian scientists and prior to occupation of the ukrainian people s republic by bolsheviks these academies were republic local name established successor ukrainian

the soviet space program in 1957 the first satellite was launched in 1961 yury gagarin became the first person in space and in 1971 the first space station salyut 1 began its operation substantial discoveries were also made in the nuclear branch and in other fields of physics furthermore the academy participated in opening new universities or new study programs in the already existed universities whose best absolvents started their career at the research institutes of the academy generally the soviet period was the most fruitful in the history of the russian soviet at these times academy of sciences and is now recalled with nostalgy by many russian scientists post-soviet period of the academy edit after the collapse of the soviet union by decree of the president of russia of december 2 1991 the academy again became the russian academy of sciences 2 inheriting all facilities of the ussr academy of sciences in the territory of the russian federation the crisis of the 1990s in the post-soviet russia and a consequent drastic reduction of the state support for science have forced many scientists to leave russia for europe israel or united states some excellent university graduates who could become promising researchers preferred to switch to other activities predominately in commerce the russian academy has practically lost a generation of people born from mid-1960s to mid-1970s this age category is now underrepresented in all research institutes in the 2000s the situation in the russian science and technology has improved the government announced a modernization campaign nevertheless according to the russian academy of sciences total r d spending in 2013 still hovered about 40 below the pre-crisis 1990 levels 16 furthermore a lack of competition decayed infrastructure and continuing though slightly reduced brain drain play their part reforms since 2013 edit on june 28 2013 the russian government unexpectedly announced a draft law presuming a dissolution of the ras and creation of a new public-governmental organization with the same name the buildings and other property of the academy were supposed to be taken under control of a government-established federal agency for scientific organizations faso russia the declared idea was to enable scientists to concentrate exclusively on research activities without worrying about housing-maintenance services or administrative things the reform was allegedly authored by mikhail kovalchuk brother of yury kovalchuk known as vladimir putin s personal banker 17 the draft law which in its initial form would have fundamentally changed the system of science organization in russia provoked conflicts with the academic circles and strong refutation by many prominent individuals 18 a large group of the ras members signalized their intention not to join the new academy if the reform is run as planned in the draft 19 the world s leading scientists including pierre deligne michael atiyah mumford and others have written open letters which referred to the planned reform of the shocking and even criminal 20 in this situation the draft was softened in some details e g there remained no words about dissolution in the text and approved on september 27 2013 now all the academy institutions are already under jurisdiction of the faso this agency was empowered to evaluate relying on its own criteria an efficiency of the institutions and rearrange ineffective ones this point is felt dangerous by many scientists 21 furthermore according to the law the two other russian national academies for agriculture and for medicine were fused to the ras as its new specialized scientific divisions during the years 2014 2017 there occurred no large-scale protest actions but in general a scientific community has not supported the launched reforms sometimes these reforms are interpreted as nothing else than a redistribution of real estate in 2017 when the new presidium of the academy was being elected the candidates for presidency negatively estimated the intermediate results of the reforms the elected ras president alexander sergeev claimed a change of the legal status of the russian academy of sciences as one of the urgent problems nevertheless he is ready to establish working relationships with the state authorities at various levels including the faso presidents
