celestial equator - wikipedia celestial equator from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the celestial equator is currently inclined by about 23.44 to the ecliptic plane the image shows the relations between earth s axial tilt or obliquity rotation axis and orbital plane the celestial equator is the great circle of the imaginary celestial sphere on the same plane as the equator of earth this plane of reference bases the equatorial coordinate system in other words the celestial equator is an abstract projection of the terrestrial equator into outer space 1 as a result of the planet s axial tilt the celestial equator is currently inclined by about 23.44 with respect to the ecliptic plane an observer standing on earth s equator visualizes the celestial equator as a semicircle passing through the zenith the point directly overhead as the observer moves north or south the celestial equator tilts towards the opposite horizon the celestial equator is defined to be infinitely distant since it is on the celestial sphere thus the observer always sees the ends of the semicircle disappear over the horizon exactly due east and due west regardless of the observer s position on earth at the poles though the celestial equator would be parallel to the horizon at all latitudes the celestial equator appears perfectly straight because the observer is only finitely far from the plane of the celestial equator but infinitely far from the celestial equator itself 2 celestial objects near the celestial equator are visible from most of the world but they culminate around the zenith as seen from the tropics the celestial equator currently passes through the following constellations pisces contains the first point of aries above its southern border cetus taurus eridanus orion monoceros canis minor hydra sextans leo virgo contains the first point of libra serpens caput ophiuchus serpens cauda aquila aquarius celestial bodies other than earth also have similarly defined celestial equators see also edit celestial pole celestial sphere declination equatorial coordinate system references edit retrieved 5 august 2011 millar william 2006 the amateur astronomer s introduction to the celestial sphere cambridge university press isbn 978-0-521-67123-1 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title celestial equator oldid 826719085 categories celestial coordinate system dynamics of the solar system technical factors of astrology navigation menu search this page was last edited on 20 february 2018 at 17 23 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
