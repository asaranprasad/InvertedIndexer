north pole - wikipedia north pole from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search coordinates an azimuthal projection showing the arctic ocean and the north pole the map also shows the 75th parallel north and 60th parallel north sea ice at the north pole in 2006 the north pole also known as the geographic north pole or terrestrial north pole is subject to the caveats explained below defined as the point in the northern hemisphere where the earth s axis of rotation meets its surface the north pole is the northernmost point on the earth lying diametrically opposite the south pole it defines geodetic latitude 90 north as well as the direction of true north at the north pole all directions point south all lines of longitude converge there so its longitude can be defined as any degree value along tight latitude circles counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west the north pole is at the center of the northern hemisphere while the south pole lies on a continental land mass the north pole is located in the middle of the arctic ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice this makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the north pole unlike the south pole however the soviet union and later russia constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937 some of which have passed over or very close to the pole since 2002 the russians have also annually established a base barneo close to the pole this operates for a few weeks during early spring studies in the 2000s predicted that the north pole may become seasonally ice-free because of arctic ice shrinkage with timescales varying from 2016 1 2 to the late 21st century or later the sea depth at the north pole has been measured at 4,261 m 13,980 ft by the russian mir submersible in 2007 3 and at 4,087 m 13,410 ft by uss nautilus in 1958 4 5 the nearest land is usually said to be kaffeklubben island off the northern coast of greenland about 700 km 430 mi away though some perhaps semi permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer the nearest permanently inhabited place is alert in the qikiqtaaluk region nunavut canada which

of the earth until in the 18th century the mathematician leonhard euler predicted that the axis might wobble slightly around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent variation of latitude as determined for a fixed point on earth from the observation of stars part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the pole across the earth s surface by a range of a few metres the wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component the component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by euler and is now called the chandler wobble after its discoverer the exact point of intersection of the earth s axis and the earth s surface at any given moment is called the instantaneous pole but because of the wobble this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed north pole or south pole when metre-scale precision is required it is desirable to tie the system of earth coordinates latitude longitude and elevations or orography to fixed landforms of course given plate tectonics and isostasy there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed yet the international earth rotation and reference systems service and the international astronomical union have defined a framework called the international terrestrial reference system exploration edit pre-1900 edit gerardus mercator s map of the north pole from 1595 c g zorgdragers map of the north pole from 1720 as early as the 16th century many prominent people correctly believed that the north pole was in a sea which in the 19th century was called the polynya or open polar sea 6 it was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year several expeditions set out to find the way generally with whaling ships already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes one of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the north pole was that of british naval officer william edward parry who in 1827 reached latitude 82 45 north in 1871 the polaris expedition a us attempt on the pole led by charles francis hall ended in disaster another british royal navy attempt on the pole part of the british arctic expedition by commander albert h markham reached a then-record 83 20 26 north in may 1876 before turning back an 1879 1881 expedition commanded by us naval officer george w delong ended tragically when their ship the uss jeanette was crushed by ice over half the crew including delong were lost nansen s ship fram in the arctic ice in april 1895 the norwegian explorers fridtjof nansen and hjalmar johansen struck out for the pole on skis after leaving nansen s icebound ship fram the pair reached latitude 86 14 north before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards eventually reaching franz josef land in 1897 swedish engineer salomon august andr e and two companions tried to reach the north pole in the hydrogen balloon rnen eagle but came down 300 km 190 mi north of kvit ya the northeasternmost part of the svalbard archipelago they trekked to kvit ya but died there three months later in 1930 the remains of this expedition were found by the norwegian bratvaag expedition the italian explorer luigi amedeo duke of the abruzzi and captain umberto cagni of the italian royal navy regia marina sailed the converted whaler stella polare pole star from norway in 1899 on 11 march 1900 cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86 34 on 25 april setting a new record by beating nansen s result of 1895 by 35 to 40 km 22 to 25 mi cagni barely managed to return to the camp remaining there until 23 june on 16 august the stella polare left rudolf island heading south and the expedition returned to norway 1900 40 edit peary s sledge party at what they claimed was the north pole 1909 from left ooqueah ootah henson egingwah seeglo 7 the us explorer frederick cook claimed to have reached the north pole on 21 april 1908 with two inuit men ahwelah and etukishook but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted 8 the conquest of the north pole was for many years credited to us navy engineer robert peary who claimed to have reached the pole on 6 april 1909 accompanied by matthew henson and four inuit men ootah seeglo egingwah and ooqueah however peary s claim remains highly disputed and controversial those who accompanied peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in western navigation and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the pole the distances and speeds that peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point peary s account of a journey to the pole and back while traveling along the direct line the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing is contradicted by henson s account of tortuous detours to avoid pressure ridges and open leads the british explorer wally herbert initially a supporter of peary researched peary s records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer s navigational records he concluded that peary had not reached the pole 9 support for peary came again in 2005 however when british explorer tom avery and four companions recreated the outward portion of peary s journey with replica wooden sleds and canadian eskimo dog teams reaching the north pole in 36 days 22 hours nearly five hours faster than peary however avery s fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles significantly short of the 135 claimed by peary avery writes on his web site that the admiration and respect which i hold for robert peary matthew henson and the four inuit men who ventured north in 1909 has grown enormously since we set out from cape columbia having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice i am more convinced than ever that peary did indeed discover the north pole 10 ivan papanin at north pole-1 drifting station 1937 another rejection of peary s claim arrived in 2009 when e myles standish of the california institute of technology an experienced referee of scientific claims reported numerous alleged lacunae and inconsistencies 11 unreliable source the first claimed flight over the pole was made on 9 may 1926 by us naval officer richard e byrd and pilot floyd bennett in a fokker tri-motor aircraft although verified at the time by a committee of the national geographic society this claim has since been undermined 12 by the 1996 revelation that byrd s long-hidden diary s solar sextant data which the ngs never checked consistently contradict his june 1926 report s parallel data by over 100 mi 160 km 13 the secret report s alleged en-route solar sextant data were inadvertently so impossibly overprecise that he excised all these alleged raw solar observations out of the version of the report finally sent to geographical societies five months later while the original version was hidden for 70 years a realization first published in 2000 by the university of cambridge after scrupulous refereeing 14 according to standish anyone who is acquainted with the facts and has any amount of logical reasoning can not avoid the conclusion that neither cook nor peary nor byrd reached the north pole and they all knew it 11 unreliable source the first consistent verified and scientifically convincing attainment of the pole was on 12 may 1926 by norwegian explorer roald amundsen and his us sponsor lincoln ellsworth from the airship norge 15 norge though norwegian-owned was designed and piloted by the italian umberto nobile the flight started from svalbard in norway and crossed the arctic ocean to alaska nobile with several scientists and crew from the norge overflew the pole a second time on 24 may 1928 in the airship italia the italia crashed on its return from the pole with the loss of half the crew in may 1937 the world s first north pole ice station north pole-1 was established by soviet scientists by air 20 kilometres 13 mi from the north pole the expedition members oceanographer pyotr shirshov meteorologist yevgeny fyodorov radio operator ernst krenkel and the leader ivan papanin 16 conducted scientific research at the station for the next nine months by 19 february 1938 when the group was picked up by the ice breakers taimyr and murman their station had drifted 2850 km to the eastern coast of greenland 17 18 1940 2000 edit in may 1945 an raf lancaster of the aries expedition became the first commonwealth aircraft to overfly the north geographic and north magnetic poles the plane was piloted by david cecil mckinley of the royal air force it carried an 11-man crew with kenneth c maclure of the royal canadian air force in charge of all scientific observations in 2006 maclure was honoured with a spot in canada s aviation hall of fame 19 discounting peary s disputed claim the first men to set foot at the north pole were a soviet party 20 including geophysicists mikhail ostrekin and pavel senko oceanographers mikhail somov and pavel gordienko 21 and other scientists and flight crew 24 people in total 22 of aleksandr kuznetsov s sever-2 expedition march may 1948 23 it was organized by the chief directorate of the northern sea route 24 the party flew on three planes pilots ivan cherevichnyy vitaly maslennikov and ilya kotov from kotelny island to the north pole and landed there at 4 44pm moscow time utc 04 00 on 23 april 1948 25 they established a temporary camp and for the next two days conducted scientific observations on 26 april the expedition flew back to the continent next year on 9 may 1949 26 two other soviet scientists vitali volovich and andrei medvedev 27 became the first people to parachute onto the north pole 28 they jumped from a douglas c-47 skytrain registered cccp h-369 29 on 3 may 1952 u s air force lieutenant colonel joseph o fletcher and lieutenant william pershing benedict along with scientist albert p crary landed a modified douglas c-47 skytrain at the north pole some western sources considered this to be the first landing at the pole 30 until the soviet landings became widely known uss skate at drift station alpha 1958 the united states navy submarine uss nautilus ssn-571 crossed the north pole on 3 august 1958 on 17 march 1959 uss skate ssn-578 surfaced at the pole breaking through the ice above it becoming the first naval vessel to do so 31 setting aside peary s claim the first confirmed surface conquest of the north pole was that of ralph plaisted walt pederson gerry pitzl and jean luc bombardier who traveled over the ice by snowmobile and arrived on 19 april 1968 the united states air force independently confirmed their position on 6 april 1969 wally herbert and companions allan gill roy koerner and kenneth hedges of the british trans-arctic expedition became the first men to reach the north pole on foot albeit with the aid of dog teams and airdrops they continued on to complete the first surface crossing of the arctic ocean and by its longest axis barrow alaska to svalbard a feat that has never been repeated 32 33 because of suggestions later proven false of plaisted s use of air transport some sources classify herbert s expedition as the first confirmed to reach the north pole over the ice surface by any means 33 34 in the 1980s plaisted s pilots weldy phipps and ken lee signed affidavits asserting that no such airlift was provided 35 it is also said that herbert was the first person to reach the pole of inaccessibility 36 icebreaker arktika the first surface ship to reach the north pole on 17 august 1977 the soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker arktika completed the first surface vessel journey to the north pole in 1982 ranulph fiennes and charles r burton became the first people to cross the arctic ocean in a single season they departed from cape crozier ellesmere island on 17 february 1982 and arrived at the geographic north pole on 10 april 1982 they travelled on foot and snowmobile from the pole they travelled towards svalbard but due to the unstable nature of the ice ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days they were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship mv benjamin bowring and boarded it on 4 august 1982 at position 80 31n 00 59w as a result of this journey which formed a section of the three-year transglobe expedition 1979 1982 fiennes and burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both north and south poles by surface travel alone this achievement remains unchallenged to this day in 1985 sir edmund hillary the first man to stand on the summit of mount everest and neil armstrong the first man to stand on the moon landed at the north pole in a small twin-engined ski plane 37 hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of everest in 1986 will steger with seven teammates became the first to be confirmed as reaching the pole by dogsled and without resupply uss gurnard ssn-662 operated in the arctic ocean under the polar ice cap from september to november 1984 in company with one of her sister ships the attack submarine uss pintado ssn-672 on 12 november 1984 gurnard and pintado became the third pair of submarines to surface together at the north pole in march 1990 gurnard deployed to the arctic region during exercise ice ex 90 and completed only the fourth winter submerged transit of the bering and seas gurnard surfaced at the north pole on april 18 in the company of the uss sea horse ssn-669 on 6 may 1986 uss archerfish ssn 678 uss ray ssn 653 and uss hawkbill ssn-666 surfaced at the north pole the first tri-submarine surfacing at the north pole on 21 april 1987 shinji kazama of japan became the first person to reach the north pole on a motorcycle 38 39 on 18 may 1987 uss billfish ssn 676 uss sea devil ssn 664 and hms superb s 109 surfaced at the north pole the first international surfacing at the north pole in 1988 a 13-man strong team 9 soviets 4 canadians skied across the arctic from siberia to northern canada one of the canadians richard weber became the first person to reach the pole from both sides of the arctic ocean on 4 may 1990 b rge ousland and erling kagge became the first explorers ever to reach the north pole unsupported after a 58-day ski trek from ellesmere island in canada a distance of 800 km 40 on 7 september 1991 the german research vessel polarstern and the swedish icebreaker oden reached the north pole as the first conventional powered vessels 41 both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common tug of war and a football game on an ice floe polarstern again reached the pole exactly 10 years later 42 with the healy in 1998 1999 and 2000 lada niva marshs special very large wheeled versions made by bronto lada vaz s experimental product division were driven to the north pole 43 44 the 1998 expedition was dropped by parachute and completed the track to the north pole the 2000 expedition departed from a russian research base around 114 km from the pole and claimed an average speed of 20 15 km h in an average temperature of 30 c 21st century edit uss charlotte at the north pole in 2005 commercial airliner flights on the polar routes may pass within viewing distance of the north pole for example the flight from chicago to beijing may come close as latitude 89 n though because of prevailing winds return journeys go over the bering strait in recent years journeys to the north pole by air landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice or by icebreaker have become relatively routine and are even available to small groups of tourists through adventure holiday companies parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the north pole in recent years the temporary seasonal russian camp of barneo has been established by air a short distance from the pole annually since 2002 and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties trips from the camp to the pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter the first attempt at underwater exploration of the north pole was made on 22 april 1998 by russian firefighter and diver andrei rozhkov with the support of the diving club of moscow state university but ended in fatality the next attempted dive at the north pole was organized the next year by the same diving club and ended in success on 24 april 1999 the divers were michael wolff austria brett cormick uk and bob wass usa 45 in 2005 the united states navy submarine uss charlotte ssn-766 surfaced through 155 cm 61 in of ice at the north pole and spent 18 hours there 46 in july 2007 british endurance swimmer lewis gordon pugh completed a 1 km 0.62 mi swim at the north pole his feat undertaken to highlight the effects of global warming took place in clear water that had opened up between the ice floes 47 his later attempt to paddle a kayak to the north pole in late 2008 following the erroneous prediction of clear water to the pole was stymied when his expedition found itself stuck in thick ice after only three days the expedition was then abandoned by september 2007 the north pole had been visited 66 times by different surface ships 54 times by soviet and russian icebreakers 4 times by swedish oden 3 times by german polarstern 3 times by uscgc healy and uscgc polar sea and once by ccgs louis s st-laurent and by swedish vidar viking 48 2007 descent to the north pole seabed edit mir submersible one of the two vehicles that were used in the first ever manned descent to the seabed under the north pole on 2 august 2007 a russian scientific expedition arktika 2007 made the first ever manned descent to the ocean floor at the north pole to a depth of 4.3 km 2.7 mi as part of the research programme in support of russia s 2001 extended continental shelf claim to a large swathe of the arctic ocean floor the descent took place in two mir submersibles and was led by soviet and russian polar explorer artur chilingarov in a symbolic act of visitation the russian flag was placed on the ocean floor exactly at the pole 49 50 51 the expedition was the latest in a series of efforts intended to give russia a dominant influence in the arctic according to the new york times 52 the warming arctic climate and summer shrinkage of the iced area has attracted the attention of many countries such as china and the united states toward the top of the world where resources and shipping routes may soon be exploitable 53 mlae 2009 expedition edit in 2009 the russian marine live-ice automobile expedition mlae-2009 with vasily elagin as a leader and a team of afanasy makovnev vladimir obikhod alexey

the russian borderland machtovyi island of the severnaya zemlya archipelago 80 15n 097 27e and the canadian coast ward hant island 83 08n 075 59w took 55 days it was 2300 km across drifting ice and about 4000 km in total the expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies the expedition was supported by the russian geographical society 54 day and night edit the sun at the north pole is continuously above the horizon during the summer and continuously below the horizon during the winter sunrise is just before the march equinox around 20 march the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23 elevation at the summer solstice around 21 june after which time it begins to sink reaching sunset just after the september equinox around 23 september when the sun is visible in the polar sky it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon this circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation in degrees above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox hence the north and south poles experience the slowest rates of sunrise and sunset on earth a civil twilight period of about two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset a nautical twilight period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset these effects are caused by a combination of the earth s axial tilt and its revolution around the sun the direction of the earth s axial tilt as well as its angle relative to the plane of the earth s orbit around the sun remains very nearly constant over the course of a year both change very slowly over long time periods at northern midsummer the north pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent as the year progresses and the earth moves around the sun the north pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the sun to its maximum extent a similar sequence is observed at the south pole with a six-month time difference time edit in most places on earth local time is determined by longitude such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky for example at midday the sun is roughly at its highest this line of reasoning fails at the north pole where the sun rises and sets only once per year and all lines of longitude and hence all time zones converge there is no permanent human presence at the north pole and no particular time zone has been assigned polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient such as greenwich mean time or the time zone of the country from which they departed citation needed climate edit arctic ice shrinkages of 2007 compared to 2005 and also compared to the 1979 2000 average the north pole is substantially warmer than the south pole because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean which acts as a reservoir of heat rather than at altitude on a continental land mass despite being an ice cap it shares some characteristics with a tundra climate etf due to the july and august temperatures peaking just above freezing winter temperatures at the north pole can range from about 50 to 13 c 58 to 9 f averaging around 31 c 24 f a however a freak storm caused the temperature to reach 0.7 c 33 f for a time at a world meteorological organization buoy located at 87.45 n on december 30 2015 it was estimated that the temperature at the north pole was between 30 and 35 f 1 and 2 c during the storm 55 summer temperatures june july and august average around the freezing point 0 c 32 f the highest temperature yet recorded is 13 c 55 f 56 much warmer than the south pole s record high of only 12.3 c 9.9 f 57 a similar spike in temperatures occurred on november 15 2016 when temperatures hit freezing 58 the sea ice at the north pole is typically around 2 to 3 m 6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in thick 59 although ice thickness its spatial extent and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate 60 studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years 61 it is likely that global warming has contributed to this but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the arctic 62 reports have also predicted that within a few decades the arctic ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer 63 this may have significant commercial implications see territorial claims below the retreat of the arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation and may have serious climate implications by contributing to arctic cyclone generation 64 climate data for greenlandic weather stationa eleven year average observations month jan feb mar apr

2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just 1 mi 1.6 km from the pole 65 66 the ringed seal has also been seen at the pole and arctic foxes have been observed less than 60 km 37 mi away at 89 40 n 67 68 birds seen at or very near the pole include the snow bunting northern fulmar and black-legged kittiwake though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions 69 fish have been seen in the waters at the north pole but these are probably few in number 69 a member of the russian team that descended to the north pole seabed in august 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there 50 however it was later reported that a sea anemone had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified shrimps and amphipods 70 territorial claims to the north pole and arctic regions edit sunset over the north pole at the international dateline 2015 currently under international law no country owns the north pole or the region of the arctic ocean surrounding it the five surrounding arctic countries russian federation canada norway denmark via greenland and the united states via alaska are limited to a 200-nautical-mile 370 km 230 mi exclusive economic zone around their coasts and the area beyond that is administered by the international seabed authority upon ratification of the united nations convention on the law of the sea a country has 10 years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile exclusive economic zone if validated such a claim gives the claimant state rights to what may be on or beneath the sea bottom within the claimed zone 71 norway ratified the convention in 1996 72 russia ratified in 1997 72 canada ratified in 2003 72 and denmark ratified in 2004 72 have all launched projects to base claims that certain areas of arctic continental shelves should be subject to their sole sovereign exploitation 73 74 in 1907 canada invoked a sector principle to claim sovereignty over a sector stretching from its coasts to the north pole this claim has not been relinquished but was not consistently pressed until 2013 75 76 cultural associations edit in some children s western cultures the geographic north pole is described as the location of santa claus workshop and residence 77 78 although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic north pole citation needed canada post has assigned postal code h0h 0h0 to the north pole referring to santa s traditional exclamation of ho ho ho 79 this association reflects an age-old esoteric mythology of hyperborea that posits the north pole the otherworldly world-axis as the abode of god and superhuman beings 80 the popular figure of the pole-dwelling santa claus thus functions as an archetype of spiritual purity and transcendence 81 as henry corbin has documented the north pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of sufism and iranian mysticism the orient sought by the mystic the orient that cannot be located on our maps is in the direction of the north beyond the north 82 owing to its remoteness the pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient iranian tradition called mount qaf jabal qaf the farthest point of the earth 83 84 according to certain authors the jabal qaf of muslim cosmology is a version of rupes nigra a mountain whose ascent like dante s climbing of the mountain of purgatory represents the pilgrim s progress through spiritual states 85 in iranian theosophy the heavenly pole
