k rm n line - wikipedia k rm n line from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the k rm n line lies within the lower thermosphere the layers of earth s atmosphere are shown out of scale 1 the k rm n line or karman line lies at an altitude of 100 km 62 mi 330,000 ft above earth s sea level and commonly represents the boundary between earth s atmosphere and outer space 2 this definition is accepted by the f d ration a ronautique internationale fai which is an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics the line is named after theodore von k rm n 1881 1963 a hungarian american engineer and physicist who was active primarily in aeronautics and astronautics he was the first person to calculate that the atmosphere around this altitude becomes too thin to support aeronautical flight since a vehicle at this altitude would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift to support itself 3 the line is approximately at the turbopause above which atmospheric gasses are not well-mixed the mesopause atmospheric temperature minimum has been measured to vary from 85 to 100 km which places the line at or near the bottom of the thermosphere contents 1 k rm n s comments 2 definition 3 interpretations of the definition 4 alternatives to the definition 5 see also 6 references 7 external links k rm n s comments edit in the final chapter of his autobiography k rm n addresses the issue of the edge of outer space where space begins can actually be determined by the speed of the space vehicle and its altitude above the earth consider for instance the record flight of captain iven carl kincheloe jr in an x-2 rocket plane kincheloe flew 2000 miles per hour 3,200 km h at 126,000 feet 38,500 m or 24 miles up at this altitude and speed aerodynamic lift still carries 98 per cent of the weight of the plane and only two per cent is carried by centrifugal force or kepler force as space scientists call it but at 300,000 feet 91,440 m or 57 miles up this relationship is reversed because there is no longer any air to contribute lift only centrifugal force prevails this is certainly a physical boundary where aerodynamics stops and astronautics begins and so i thought why should it not also be a jurisdictional boundary haley has kindly called it the k rm n jurisdictional line below this line space belongs to each country above this level there would be free space 4 definition edit an atmosphere does not abruptly end at any given height but becomes progressively thinner with altitude also depending on how the various layers that make up the space around the earth are defined and depending on whether these layers are considered part of the actual atmosphere the definition of the edge of space could vary considerably if one were to consider the thermosphere and exosphere part of the atmosphere and not of space one might have to extend the boundary to space to at least 10,000 km 6,200 mi above sea level the k rm n line thus is an arbitrary definition based on the following considerations an aircraft only stays aloft if it constantly travels forward relative to the air airspeed is not dependent on speed relative to ground so that the wings can generate lift the thinner the air the faster the plane must go to generate enough lift to stay up the amount of lift required at any given point can be calculated by the lift equation 5 6 l 1 2 v 2 s c l displaystyle l tfrac 1 2 rho v 2 sc l where l is the lift force is the air density v is the aircraft s speed relative to the air s is the aircraft s wing area c l is the lift coefficient 7 lift l generated is directly proportional to the air density all other factors remaining unchanged true airspeed v must increase to compensate for less air density at higher altitudes an orbiting spacecraft only stays in the sky if the centrifugal component of its movement around the earth is enough to balance the downward pull of gravity if it goes slower the pull of gravity gradually makes its altitude decrease the required speed is called orbital velocity and it varies with the height of the orbit for the international space station or a space shuttle in low earth orbit the orbital velocity is about 27,000 km per hour 17,000 miles per hour for an airplane flying higher and higher the increasingly thin air provides less and less lift requiring increasingly higher speed to create enough lift to hold the airplane up it eventually reaches an altitude where it must fly so fast to generate lift that it reaches orbital velocity the k rm n line is the altitude where the speed necessary to aerodynamically support the airplane s full weight equals orbital velocity assuming wing loading of a typical airplane in practice supporting full weight wouldn t be necessary to maintain altitude because the curvature of the earth adds centrifugal lift as the airplane reaches orbital speed however the karman line definition ignores this effect because orbital velocity is implicitly sufficient to maintain any altitude regardless of atmospheric density the karman line is therefore the highest altitude at which orbital speed provides sufficient aerodynamic lift to fly in a straight line that doesn t follow the curvature of the earth s surface above 100 kilometers the air density is about 1 2200000 the density on the surface 8 at the karman line the air density is such that l 1 2 v 0 2 s c l m g displaystyle l tfrac 1 2 rho v 0 2 sc l mg where v 0 is the speed of a circular orbit at the same altitude in vacuum m is the mass of the aircraft g is the acceleration due to gravity although the calculated altitude was not exactly 100 km k rm n proposed that 100 km be the designated boundary to space because the round number is more memorable and the calculated altitude varies minutely as certain parameters are varied an international committee recommended the 100 km line to the fai and upon adoption it became widely accepted as the boundary to space for many purposes 9 however there is still no international legal definition of the demarcation between a country s air space and outer space 10 another hurdle to strictly defining the boundary to space is the dynamic nature of earth s atmosphere for example at an altitude of 1,000 km 620 mi the atmosphere s density can vary by a factor of five depending on the time of day time of year ap magnetic index and recent solar flux citation needed the fai uses the k rm n line to define the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics 11 aeronautics for fai purposes aerial activity including all air sports within 100 kilometers of earth s surface astronautics for fai purposes activity more than 100 kilometers above earth s surface interpretations of the definition edit some people who including the fai citation needed in some of their publications also use the expression edge of space to refer to a region below the conventional 100 km boundary to space which is often meant to include substantially lower regions as well thus certain balloon or airplane flights might be described as reaching the edge of space in such statements reaching the edge of space merely refers to going higher than average aeronautical vehicles commonly would 12 13 in 1963 andrew g haley discussed the k rm n line in his book space law and government 14 in a chapter on the limits of national sovereignty he made a survey of major writers views 14 82 96 he indicated the inherent imprecision of the line the line represents a mean or median measurement it is comparable to such measures used in the law as mean sea level meander line tide line but it is more complex than these in arriving at the von k rm n jurisdictional line myriad factors must be considered other than the factor of aerodynamic lift these factors have been discussed in a very large body of literature and by a score or more of commentators they include the physical constitution of the air the biological and physiological viability and still other factors which logically join to establish a point at which air no longer exists and at which airspace ends 14 78,9 alternatives to the definition edit the u s air force definition of an astronaut is a person who has flown more than 50 miles 80 km above mean sea level approximately the line between the mesosphere and the thermosphere nasa uses the fai s 100-kilometer figure 12 the united states does not officially define a boundary of space in 2005 three veteran nasa x-15 pilots john b mckay william h dana and joseph albert walker were retroactively two posthumously awarded their astronaut wings as they had flown between 90 km 56 mi and 108 km 67 mi in the 1960s but at the time had not been recognized as astronauts 12 the latter altitude exceeds the modern international definition of the boundary of space another definition proposed in international law discussions defines the lower boundary of space as the lowest perigee attainable by an orbiting space vehicle but does not specify an altitude due to atmospheric drag the lowest altitude at which an object in a circular orbit can complete at least one full revolution without propulsion is approximately 150 km 90 mi whereas an object can maintain an elliptical orbit with perigee as low as about 130 km 80 mi without propulsion above altitudes of approximately 160 km 100 mi the sky is completely black 15 atmospheric gases scatter blue wavelengths of visible light more than other wavelengths giving the earth s visible edge a blue halo the moon is seen behind the halo at higher and higher altitudes the atmosphere becomes so thin that it essentially ceases to exist gradually the atmospheric halo fades into the blackness of
