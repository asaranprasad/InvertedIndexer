fahrenheit - wikipedia fahrenheit from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search thermometer with fahrenheit marked on outer bezel and celsius marked on inner dial degree units the fahrenheit scale was the first standardized temperature scale to be widely used the fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by dutch-german-polish physicist daniel gabriel fahrenheit 1686 1736 1 it uses the degree fahrenheit symbol f as the unit several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist the lower defining point 0 f was established as the temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice water and salt ammonium chloride 2 further limits were established as the melting point of ice 32 f and his best estimate of the average human body temperature 96 f about 2.6 f less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale 3 the scale is now usually defined by two fixed points the temperature at which water freezes into ice is defined as 32 f and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 f a 180 f separation as defined at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure by the end of the 20th century fahrenheit was used as the official temperature scale only in the united states including its unincorporated territories its freely associated states in the western pacific palau the federated states of micronesia and the marshall islands the bahamas belize and the cayman islands 4 all other countries in the world now use the celsius scale named after swedish astronomer anders celsius defined since 1954 by absolute zero being 273.15 c and the triple point of water being at 0.01 c 5 before 1954 the celsius scale was based on 0 c for the freezing point of water and 100 c for the boiling point of water at 1 atm contents 1 definition and conversion 2 history 3 usage 4 unicode representation of symbol 5 see also 6 notes and references 7 external links definition and conversion edit fahrenheit temperature conversion formulae from fahrenheit to fahrenheit celsius c f 32 5 9 f c 9 5 32 kelvin k f 459.67 5 9 f k 9 5 459.67 rankine r f 459.67 f r 459.67 for temperature intervals rather than specific temperatures 1 f 1 r 5 9 c 5 9 k comparisons among various temperature scales on the fahrenheit scale the freezing point of water is 32 degrees fahrenheit f and the boiling point is 212 f at standard atmospheric pressure this puts the boiling and freezing points of water exactly 180 degrees apart 6 therefore a degree on the fahrenheit scale is 1 180 of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point on the celsius scale the freezing and boiling points of water are 100 degrees apart a temperature interval of 1 f is equal to an interval of 5 9 degrees celsius the fahrenheit and celsius scales intersect at 40 i e 40 f 40 c absolute zero is 273.15 c or 459.67 f the rankine temperature scale uses degree intervals of the same size as those of the fahrenheit scale except that absolute zero is 0 r the same way that the kelvin temperature scale matches the celsius scale except that absolute zero is 0 k 6 the fahrenheit scale uses the symbol to denote a point on the temperature scale as does celsius and the letter f to indicate the use of the fahrenheit scale e g gallium melts at 85.5763 f 7 as well as to denote a difference between temperatures or an uncertainty in temperature e g the output of the heat exchanger experiences an increase of 72 f and our standard uncertainty is 5 f for an exact conversion the following formulas can be applied here f is the value in fahrenheit and c the value in celsius f fahrenheit to c celsius f 32 f 5 c 9 f f 32 1.8 c c c c celsius to f fahrenheit c c 9 f 5 c 32 f c 1.8 f 32 f f f this is also an exact conversion making use of the identity -40 f -40 c again f is the value in fahrenheit and c the value in celsius f fahrenheit to c celsius f 40 1.8 40 c c celsius to f fahrenheit c 40 1.8 40 f history edit daniel gabriel fahrenheit a pioneer of exact thermometry temperature measurement he invented the mercury thermometer first practical accurate thermometer and fahrenheit scale first widely used standardized temperature scale fahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724 basing it on two reference points of temperature in his initial scale which is not the final fahrenheit scale the zero point was determined by placing the thermometer in a mixture of ice water and ammonium chloride salis armoniaci 8 this is a frigorific mixture which stabilizes its temperature automatically that stable temperature was defined as 0 f 17.78 c the second point 96 degrees was approximately the human body s temperature sanguine hominis sani the blood of a healthy man 9 according to a story in germany fahrenheit actually chose the lowest air temperature measured in his hometown danzig in winter 1708 09 as 0 f and only later had the need to be able to make this value reproducible using brine 10 this is one explanation given why 0 f is 17.78 c but the ammonium chloride cooling temperature actually is 3 c whereas that of nacl is 21.1 c the other explanation is that he did not have a good enough brine solution to obtain the eutectic equilibrium exactly i e he might have had a mixture of salts or it had not fully dissolved in any case the definition of the fahrenheit scale has changed since according to a letter fahrenheit wrote to his friend herman boerhaave 11 his scale was built on the work of ole r mer whom he had met earlier in r mer s scale brine freezes at zero water freezes and melts at 7.5 degrees body temperature is 22.5 and water boils at 60 degrees fahrenheit multiplied each value by four in order to eliminate fractions and increase the granularity of the scale he then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature which were at 30 and 90 degrees he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees and body temperature 96 degrees so that 64 intervals would separate the two allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six times since 64 is 2 to the sixth power 12 13 fahrenheit observed that water boils at about 212 degrees using this scale the use of the freezing and boiling points of water as thermometer fixed reference points became popular following the work of anders celsius and these fixed points were adopted by a committee of the royal society led by henry cavendish in 1776 14 under this system the fahrenheit scale is redefined slightly so that the freezing point of water is exactly 32 f and the boiling point is exactly 212 f or 180 degrees higher it is for this reason that normal human body temperature is approximately 98 oral temperature on the revised scale whereas it was 90 on fahrenheit s multiplication of r mer and 96 on his original scale 15 the rankine temperature scale was based upon the fahrenheit temperature scale with its zero representing absolute zero instead usage edit countries that use fahrenheit countries that use celsius the fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic industrial and medical purposes in english-speaking countries until the 1960s in the late 1960s and 1970s the celsius scale replaced fahrenheit in almost all of those countries with the notable exception of the united states typically during their metrication process fahrenheit is used in the united states its territories and associated states all served by the u s national weather service as well as the bahamas belize and the cayman islands for everyday applications for example u s weather forecasts food cooking and freezing temperatures are typically given in degrees fahrenheit scientists such as meteorologists use celsius or kelvin in all countries 16 early in the 20th century halsey and dale suggested that the resistance to the use of centigrade now celsius system in the u s included the larger size of each degree celsius and the lower zero point in the fahrenheit system 17 canada has passed legislation favoring the international system of units while also maintaining legal definitions for traditional canadian imperial units 18 canadian weather reports are conveyed using degrees celsius with occasional reference to fahrenheit especially for cross-border broadcasts virtually all canadian ovens make legal use of the fahrenheit scale 19 thermometers both digital and analog sold in canada usually employ both the celsius and fahrenheit scales 20 21 22 also in some instances swimming pool temperature thermostats or cooking temperatures for example temperatures are still expressed in fahrenheit european laundry symbol for wash at 40 c within the european union it is mandatory to use kelvins or degrees celsius when quoting temperature for economic public health public safety and administrative purposes though degrees fahrenheit may be used alongside degrees celsius as a supplementary unit 23 for example the laundry symbols used in the united kingdom follow the recommendations of iso 3758 2005 showing the temperature of the washing machine water in degrees celsius only 24 the equivalent label in north america uses one to six dots to denote temperature with an optional temperature in degrees celsius 25 26 within the unregulated sector such as journalism the use of fahrenheit in the united kingdom follows no fixed pattern with degrees fahrenheit often appearing alongside degrees celsius the daily mail on its daily weather page quotes celsius first followed by fahrenheit in brackets 27 the daily telegraph does not mention fahrenheit on its daily weather page 28 while the times also has an all-metric daily weather page but has a celsius-to-fahrenheit conversion table 29 when publishing news stories much of the uk press adopted a convention of using degrees celsius in headlines relating to low temperatures and fahrenheit for high temperatures although this has become less common in recent years in february 2006 the writer of an article in the times suggested that the rationale was one of emphasis 6 c sounds colder than 21 f and 94 f sounds more impressive than 34 c 30 unicode representation of symbol edit unicode provides the fahrenheit symbol at codepoint u 2109 degree fahrenheit however this is a compatibility character encoded for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings the unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character the sequence u 00b0 degree sign u 0046 f latin capital letter f is preferred over u 2109 degree fahrenheit and those two sequences should be treated as identical for searching 31 see also edit comparison of temperature scales degree of frost notes and references
