temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics the kelvin symbol k is the base unit of temperature in the international system of units si the kelvin is defined as the fraction 1 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water exactly 0.01 c or 32.018 f 1 in other words it is defined such that the triple point of water is exactly 273.16 k the kelvin scale is named after the belfast-born glasgow university engineer and physicist william thomson 1st baron kelvin 1824 1907 who wrote of the need for an absolute thermometric scale unlike the degree fahrenheit and degree celsius the kelvin is not referred to or typeset as a degree the kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement in the physical sciences but is often used in conjunction with the degree celsius which has the same magnitude the definition implies that absolute zero 0 k is equivalent to 273.15 c 459.67 f contents 1 history 2 usage conventions 2.1 use

links history edit lord kelvin the namesake of the unit in 1848 william thomson who later was made lord kelvin wrote in his paper on an absolute thermometric scale of the need for a scale whereby infinite cold absolute zero was the scale s null point and which used the degree celsius for its unit increment kelvin calculated that absolute zero was equivalent to 273 c on the air thermometers of the time 2 this absolute scale is known today as the kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale kelvin s value of 273 was the negative reciprocal of 0.00366 the accepted expansion coefficient of gas per degree celsius relative to the ice point giving a remarkable consistency to the currently accepted value in 1954 resolution 3 of the 10th general conference on weights and measures cgpm gave the kelvin scale its modern definition by designating the triple point of water as its second defining point and assigned its temperature to exactly 273.16 kelvins 3 in 1967 1968 resolution 3 of the 13th cgpm renamed the unit increment of thermodynamic temperature kelvin symbol k replacing degree kelvin symbol k 4 furthermore feeling it useful to more explicitly define the magnitude of the unit increment the 13th cgpm also held in resolution 4 that the kelvin unit of thermodynamic temperature is equal to the fraction 1 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water 1 in 2005 the comit international des poids et mesures cipm a committee of the cgpm affirmed that for the purposes of delineating the temperature of the triple point of water the definition of the kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale would refer to water having an isotopic composition specified as vsmow 5 usage conventions edit when spelled out or spoken the unit is pluralised using the same grammatical rules as for other si units such as the volt or ohm e g the triple point of water is exactly 273.16 kelvins 6 dubious discuss when reference is made to the kelvin scale the word kelvin which is normally a noun functions adjectivally to modify the noun scale and is capitalized as with most other si unit symbols angle symbols e g 45 3 4 are the exception there is a space between the numeric value and the kelvin symbol e g 99.987 k 7 8 before the 13th cgpm in 1967 1968 the unit kelvin was called a degree the same as with the other temperature scales at the time it was distinguished from the other scales with either the adjective suffix kelvin degree kelvin or with absolute degree absolute and its symbol was k the latter term degree absolute which was the unit s official name from 1948 until 1954 was ambiguous since it could also be interpreted as referring to the rankine scale before the 13th cgpm the plural form was degrees absolute the 13th cgpm changed the unit name to simply kelvin symbol k 9 the omission of degree indicates that it is not relative to an arbitrary reference point like the celsius and fahrenheit scales although the rankine scale continued to use degree rankine but rather an absolute unit of measure which can be manipulated algebraically e g multiplied by two to indicate twice the amount of mean energy available among elementary degrees of freedom of the system use in conjunction with degrees celsius edit a thermometer calibrated in degrees celsius left and kelvins right in science and engineering degrees celsius and kelvins are often used simultaneously in the same article where absolute temperatures are given in degrees celsius but temperature intervals are given in kelvins e g its measured value was 7002273160280000000 0.01028 c with an uncertainty of 60 k this practice is permissible because the degree celsius is a special name for the kelvin for use in expressing relative temperatures and the magnitude of the degree celsius is exactly equal to that of the kelvin 10 notwithstanding that the official endorsement provided by resolution 3 of the 13th cgpm states a temperature interval may also be expressed in degrees celsius 4 the practice of simultaneously using both c and k is widespread throughout the scientific world the use of si prefixed forms of the degree celsius such as c or microdegrees celsius to express a temperature interval has not been widely adopted proposed redefinition edit in 2005 the cipm embarked on a program to redefine the kelvin along with the other si units using a more experimentally rigorous methodology the current definition as of 2016 is unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 k and above 7003130000000000000 1300 k 11 in particular the committee proposed redefining the kelvin such that boltzmann s constant takes the exact value 6977138065049999999 1.3806505 10 23 j k 12 the committee had hoped that the program would be completed in time for its adoption by the cgpm at its 2011 meeting but at the 2011 meeting the decision was postponed to the 2014 meeting when it would be considered as part of a larger program 13 the redefinition was further postponed in 2014 pending more accurate measurements of boltzmann s constant in terms of the current definition but it is expected to be adopted at the 26th cgpm in late 2018 14 from a scientific point of view this will link temperature to the rest of si and result in a stable definition that is independent of any particular substance from a practical point of view the redefinition will pass unnoticed water will still freeze at 273.15 k 0.00 c 32.00 f 15 practical uses edit colour temperature edit the kelvin is often used in the measure of the colour temperature of light sources colour temperature is based upon the principle that a black body radiator emits light whose colour depends on the temperature of the radiator black bodies with temperatures below about 7003400000000000000 4000 k appear reddish whereas those above about 7003750000000000000 7500 k appear bluish colour temperature is important in the fields of image projection and photography where a colour temperature of approximately 7003560000000000000 5600 k is required to match daylight film emulsions in astronomy the stellar classification of stars and their place on the hertzsprung russell diagram are based in part upon their surface temperature known as effective temperature the photosphere of the sun for instance has an effective temperature of 7003577800000000000 5778 k digital cameras and photographic software often use colour temperature in k in edit and setup menus the simple guide is that the higher the colour temperature the more white or blue the image will be the reduction in colour temperature will give an image more dominated by reddish warmer colours kelvin as a measure of noise edit in electronics the kelvin is used as an indicator of how noisy a circuit is in relation to an ultimate noise floor i e the noise temperature the so-called johnson nyquist noise of discrete resistors and capacitors is a type of thermal noise derived from the boltzmann constant and can be used to determine the noise temperature of a circuit using the friis formulas for noise unicode character edit the symbol is encoded in unicode at codepoint u 212a kelvin sign however this is a compatibility character provided for compatibility with legacy encodings the unicode standard recommends using u 004b k latin capital letter k instead that is a normal capital k three letterlike symbols have been given canonical equivalence to regular letters u 2126 ohm sign u 212a kelvin sign and u 212b angstrom sign in all three instances the regular letter should be used
