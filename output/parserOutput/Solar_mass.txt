solar mass - wikipedia solar mass from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search size and mass of very large stars from right to left vy canis majoris 17 8 m betelgeuse 11.6 5.0 m rho cassiopeiae 14-30 m and the blue pistol star 27.5 m the concentric ovals indicate the size of neptune s blue jupiter s red and the earth s grey orbits properly scaled the sun 1 m only appears as a tiny dot in the center of the ovals click for higher resolution to see earth orbit and sun the solar mass m is a standard unit of mass in astronomy equal to approximately 7030200000000000000 2 1030 kg it is used to indicate the masses of other stars as well as clusters nebulae and galaxies it is equal to the mass of the sun about two nonillion two quintillion in the long scale kilograms m 7030198855000000000 1.98855 0.00025 1030 kg 1 2 the above mass is about 7005332946000000000 332946 times the mass of earth m or 7003104800000000000 1048 times the mass of jupiter mj because earth follows an elliptical orbit around the sun the solar mass can be computed from the equation for the orbital period of a small body orbiting a central mass 3 based upon the length of the year the distance from earth to the sun an astronomical unit or au and the gravitational constant g the mass of the sun is given by m 4 2 1 a u 3 g 1 y r 2 displaystyle m odot frac 4 pi 2 times 1 mathrm au 3 g times 1 mathrm yr 2 the value of g is difficult to measure and is only known with limited accuracy in si units see cavendish experiment the value of g times the mass of an object called the standard gravitational parameter is known for the sun and several planets to much higher accuracy than g alone as a result the solar mass is used as the standard mass in the astronomical system of units contents 1 history 2 related units 3 see also 4 references 5 further reading history edit the value of the gravitational constant was first derived from measurements that were made by henry cavendish in 1798 with a torsion balance the value he obtained differs by only 1 from the modern value 4 the diurnal parallax of the sun was accurately measured during the transits of venus in 1761 and 1769 5 yielding a value of 6995436332312998583 9 9 arcseconds compared to the present 1976 value of 6995426352326410207 8.794148 from the value of the diurnal parallax one can determine the distance to the sun from the geometry of earth 6 the first person to estimate the mass of the sun was isaac newton in his work principia 1687 he estimated that the ratio of the mass of earth to the sun was about 1 28 700 later he determined that his value was based upon a faulty value for the solar parallax which he had used to estimate the distance to the sun 1 au he corrected his estimated ratio to 1 169 282 in the third edition of the principia the current value for the solar parallax is smaller still yielding an estimated mass ratio of 1 332 946 7 as a unit of measurement the solar mass came into use before the au and the gravitational constant were precisely measured this is because the relative mass of another planet in the solar system or the combined mass of two binary stars can be calculated in units of solar mass directly from the orbital radius and orbital period of the planet or stars using kepler s third law provided that orbital radius is measured in astronomical units and orbital period is measured in years the mass of the sun has been decreasing since the time it formed this occurs through two processes in nearly equal amounts first in the sun s core hydrogen is converted into helium through nuclear fusion in particular the p p chain and this reaction converts some mass into energy in the form of gamma ray photons most of this energy eventually radiates away from the sun second high-energy protons and electrons in the atmosphere of the sun are ejected directly into outer space as a solar wind the original mass of the sun at the time it reached the main sequence remains uncertain the early sun had much higher mass-loss rates than at present and it may have lost anywhere from 1 7 of its natal mass over the course of its main-sequence lifetime 8 the sun gains a very small amount of mass through the impact of asteroids and comets however as the sun already contains 99.86 of the solar system s total mass these impacts cannot offset the mass lost by radiation and ejection related units edit one solar mass m can be converted to related units 7007270685100000000 27068510 ml lunar mass 7005332946000000000 332946 m earth mass 7003104756000000000 1047.56 mj
