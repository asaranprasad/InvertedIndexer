mantle plume - wikipedia mantle plume from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a superplume generated by cooling processes in the mantle lvz low-velocity zone 1 a mantle plume is an upwelling of abnormally hot rock within the earth s mantle first proposed by j tuzo wilson in 1963 2 as the heads of mantle plumes can partly melt when they reach shallow depths they are often invoked as the cause of volcanic hotspots such as hawaii or iceland and flood basalts such as the deccan and siberian traps some such volcanic regions lie far from tectonic plate boundaries while others represent unusually large-volume volcanism near plate boundaries or in large igneous provinces a mantle plume is posited to exist where hot rock nucleates at the core-mantle boundary and rises through the earth s mantle becoming a diapir in the earth s crust 3 the currently active volcanic centers are known as hotspots in particular the concept that mantle plumes are fixed relative to one another and anchored at the core-mantle boundary would provide a natural explanation for the time-progressive chains of older volcanoes seen extending out from some such hot spots such as the hawaiian emperor seamount chain the hypothesis of mantle plumes from depth is not universally accepted as explaining all such volcanism it has required progressive hypothesis-elaboration leading to variant propositions such as mini-plumes and pulsing plumes another hypothesis for unusual volcanic regions is the plate model this proposes shallower passive leakage of magma from the mantle onto the earth s surface where extension of the lithosphere permits it attributing most volcanism to plate tectonic processes with volcanoes far from plate boundaries resulting from intraplate extension 4 contents 1

external links concepts edit in 1971 geophysicist w jason morgan further developed the hypothesis of mantle plumes in this hypothesis convection in the mantle transports heat from the core to the earth s surface in thermal diapirs in this concept two largely independent convective processes occur in the mantle the broad convective flow associated with plate tectonics which is driven primarily by the sinking of cold plates of lithosphere back into the mantle asthenosphere and mantle plumes which carry heat upward in narrow rising columns driven by heat exchange across the core-mantle boundary the latter type of convection is postulated to be independent of plate motions the sizes and occurrence of mushroom mantle plumes can be predicted easily by transient instability theory developed by tan and thorpe 5 6 the theory predicts mushroom mantle plumes of about 2000 km diameter with a critical time clarification needed of about 830 myr for a core mantle heat flux of 20 mw m2 while the cycle time clarification needed is about 2 gyr 7 the number of mantle plumes is predicted to be about 17 the plume hypothesis was studied using laboratory experiments conducted in small fluid-filled tanks in the early 1970s 8 thermal or compositional fluid-dynamical plumes produced in that way were presented as models for the much larger postulated mantle plumes on the basis of these experiments mantle plumes are now postulated to comprise two parts a long thin conduit connecting the top of the plume to its base and a bulbous head that expands in size as the plume rises the entire structure is considered to resemble a mushroom the bulbous head of thermal plumes forms because hot material moves upward through the conduit faster than the plume itself rises through its surroundings in the late 1980s and early 1990s experiments with thermal models showed that as the bulbous head expands it may entrain some of the adjacent mantle into the head when a plume head encounters the base of the lithosphere it is expected to flatten out against this barrier and to undergo widespread decompression melting to form large volumes of basalt magma it may then erupt onto the surface numerical modelling predicts that melting and eruption will take place over several million years 9 these eruptions have been linked to flood basalts although many of those erupt over much shorter time scales less than 1 million years examples include the deccan traps in india the siberian traps of asia the karoo-ferrar basalts dolerites in south africa and antarctica the paran and etendeka traps in south america and africa formerly a single province separated by opening of the south atlantic ocean and the columbia river basalts of north america flood basalts in the oceans are known as oceanic plateaus and include the ontong java plateau of the western pacific ocean and the kerguelen plateau of the indian ocean the narrow vertical pipe or conduit postulated to connect the plume head to the core-mantle boundary is viewed as providing a continuous supply of magma to a fixed location often referred to as a hotspot as the overlying tectonic plate lithosphere moves over this hotspot the eruption of magma from the fixed conduit onto the surface is expected to form a chain of volcanoes that parallels plate motion 10 the hawaiian islands chain in the pacific ocean is the type example interestingly it has recently been discovered that the volcanic locus of this chain has not been fixed over time and it thus joined the club of the many type examples that do not exhibit the key characteristic originally proposed 11 the eruption of continental flood basalts is often associated with continental rifting and breakup this has led to the hypothesis that mantle plumes contribute to continental rifting and the formation of ocean basins in the context of the alternative plate model continental breakup is a process integral to plate tectonics and massive volcanism occurs as a natural consequence when it onsets 12 the current mantle plume theory is that material and energy from earth s interior are exchanged with the surface crust in two distinct modes the predominant steady state plate tectonic regime driven by upper mantle convection and a punctuated intermittently dominant mantle overturn regime driven by plume convection 3 this second regime while often discontinuous is periodically significant in mountain building 13 and continental breakup 14 chemistry heat flow and melting edit hydrodynamic simulation of a single finger of the rayleigh taylor instability a possible mechanism for plume formation 15 in the third and fourth frame in the sequence the plume forms a mushroom cap note that the core is at the top of the diagram and the crust is at the bottom earth cross-section showing location of upper 3 and lower 5 mantle d -layer 6 and outer 7 and inner 9 core the chemical and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots differs subtly from mid-ocean-ridge basalts this geochemical signature arises from the mixing of near-surface materials such as subducted slabs and continental sediments in the mantle source there are two competing interpretations for this in the context of mantle plumes the near-surface material is postulated to have been transported down to the core-mantle boundary by subducting slabs and to have been transported back up to the surface by plumes in the context of the plate hypothesis subducted material is mostly re-circulated in the shallow mantle and tapped from there by volcanoes the processing of oceanic crust lithosphere and sediment through a subduction zone decouples the water-soluble trace elements e g k rb th from the immobile trace elements e g ti nb ta concentrating the immobile elements in the oceanic slab the water-soluble elements are added to the crust in island arc volcanoes seismic tomography shows that subducted oceanic slabs sink as far as the bottom of the mantle transition zone at 650 km depth subduction to greater depths is less certain but there is evidence that they may sink to mid-lower-mantle depths at about 1,500 km depth the source of mantle plumes is postulated to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000 km depth 16 because there is little material transport across the core-mantle boundary heat transfer must occur by conduction with adiabatic gradients above and below this boundary the core-mantle boundary is a strong thermal temperature discontinuity the temperature of the core is approximately 1,000 degrees celsius higher than that of the overlying mantle plumes are postulated to rise as the base of the mantle becomes hotter and more buoyant plumes are postulated to rise through the mantle and begin to partially melt on reaching shallow depths in the asthenosphere by decompression melting this would create large volumes of magma the plume hypothesis postulates that this melt rises to the surface and erupts to form hot spots the lower mantle and the core edit calculated earth s temperature vs depth dashed curve layered mantle convection solid curve whole mantle convection 17 the most prominent thermal contrast known to exist in the deep 1000 km mantle is at the core-mantle boundary mantle plumes were originally postulated to rise from this layer because the hot spots that are assumed to be their surface expression were thought to be fixed relative to one another this required that plumes were sourced from beneath the shallow asthenosphere that is thought to be flowing rapidly in response to motion of the overlying tectonic plates there is no other known major thermal boundary layer in the deep earth and so the core-mantle boundary was the only candidate the base of the mantle is known as the d layer a seismological subdivision of the earth it appears to be compositionally distinct from the overlying mantle and may contain partial melt two very large broad large low-shear-velocity provinces exist in the lower mantle under africa and under the central pacific it is postulated that small plumes rise from their surface or their edges their low seismic velocities were thought to suggest that they are relatively hot although it has recently been shown that their low wave velocities are due to high density caused by chemical heterogeneity 18 19 evidence for the theory edit various lines of evidence have been cited in support of mantle plumes there is some confusion regarding what constitutes support as there has been a tendency to re-define the postulated characteristics of mantle plumes after observations have been made 4 some common and basic lines of evidence cited in support of the theory are linear volcanic chains noble gases geophysical anomalies and geochemistry linear volcanic chains edit the age-progressive distribution of the hawaiian-emperor seamount chain has been explained as a result of a fixed deep-mantle plume rising into the upper mantle partly melting and causing a volcanic chain to form as the plate moves overhead relative to the fixed plume source 16 other hot spots with time-progressive volcanic chains behind them include r union the chagos-laccadive ridge the louisville ridge the ninety east ridge and kerguelen tristan and yellowstone an intrinsic aspect of the plume hypothesis is that the hot spots and their volcanic trails have been fixed relative to one another throughout geological time whereas there is evidence that the chains listed above are time-progressive it has however been shown that they are not fixed relative to one another the most remarkable example of this is the emperor chain the older part of the hawaii system which was formed by migration of volcanic activity across a geo-stationary plate 11 many postulated hot spots are also lacking time-progressive volcanic trails e g iceland the galapagos and the azores mismatches between the predictions of the hypothesis and observations are commonly explained by auxiliary processes such as mantle wind ridge capture ridge escape and lateral flow of plume material noble gas and other isotopes edit helium-3 is a primordial isotope that formed in the big bang very little is produced and little has been added to the earth by other processes since then 20 helium-4 includes a primordial component but it is also produced by the natural radioactive decay of u and th over time he in the upper atmosphere is lost into space thus the earth has become progressively depleted in he and 3he is not replaced as 4he is as a result the ratio 3he 4he in the earth has decreased over time unusually high 3he 4he have been observed in some but not all hot spots in mantle plume theory this is explained by plumes tapping a deep primordial reservoir in the lower mantle where the original high 3he 4he ratios have been preserved throughout geologic time 21 in the context of the plate hypothesis the high ratios are explained by preservation of old material in the shallow mantle ancient high 3he 4he ratios would be particularly easily preserved in materials lacking u or th so 4he was not added over time olivine and dunite both found in subducted crust are materials of this sort 20 other elements e g osmium have been suggested to be tracers of material arising from near to the earth s core in basalts at oceanic islands however so far conclusive proof for this is lacking 22 geophysical anomalies edit diagram showing a cross section though the earth s lithosphere in yellow with magma rising from the mantle in red the crust may move relative to the plume creating a track the plume hypothesis has been tested by looking for the geophysical anomalies predicted to be associated with them these include thermal seismic and elevation anomalies thermal anomalies are inherent in the term hotspot they can be measured in numerous different ways including surface heat flow petrology and seismology thermal anomalies produce anomalies in the speeds of seismic waves but unfortunately so do composition and partial melt as a result wave speeds cannot be used simply and directly to measure temperature but more sophisticated approaches must be taken seismic anomalies are identified by mapping variations in wave speed as seismic waves travel through earth a hot mantle plume is predicted to have lower seismic wave speeds compared with similar material at a lower temperature mantle material containing a trace of partial melt e g as a result of it having a lower melting point or being richer in fe also has a lower seismic wave speed and those effects are stronger than temperature thus although unusually low wave speeds have been taken to indicate anomalously hot mantle beneath hot spots this interpretation is ambiguous 4 the most commonly cited seismic wave-speed images that are used to look for variations in regions where plumes have been proposed come from seismic tomography this method involves using a network of seismometers to construct three-dimensional images of the variation in seismic wave speed throughout the mantle 23 seismic waves generated by large earthquakes enable structure below the earth s surface to be determined along the ray path seismic waves that have traveled a thousand or more kilometers also called teleseismic waves can be used to image large regions of earth s mantle they also have limited resolution however and only structures at least several hundred kilometers in diameter can be detected seismic tomography images have been cited as evidence for a number of mantle plumes in earth s mantle 24 there is however vigorous on-going discussion regarding whether the structures imaged are reliably resolved and whether they correspond to columns of hot rising rock 25 the mantle plume hypothesis predicts that domal topographic uplifts will develop when plume heads impinge on the base of the lithosphere an uplift of this kind occurred when the north atlantic ocean opened about 54 million years ago some scientists have linked this to a mantle plume postulated to have caused the breakup of eurasia and the opening of the north atlantic now suggested to underlie iceland current research has shown that the time-history of the uplift is probably much shorter than predicted however it is thus not clear how strongly this observation supports the mantle plume hypothesis geochemistry edit basalts found at oceanic islands are geochemically distinct from those found at mid-ocean ridges and volcanoes associated with subduction zones island arc basalts ocean island basalt is also similar to basalts found throughout the oceans on both small and large seamounts thought to be formed by eruptions on the sea floor that did not rise above the surface of the ocean they are also compositionally similar to some basalts found in the interiors of the continents e g the snake river plain in major elements ocean island basalts are typically higher in iron fe and titanium ti than mid-ocean ridge basalts at similar magnesium mg contents in trace elements they are typically more enriched in the light rare-earth elements than mid-ocean ridge basalts compared to island arc basalts ocean island basalts are lower in alumina al2o3 and higher in immobile trace elements e g ti nb ta these differences result from processes that occur during the subduction of oceanic crust and mantle lithosphere oceanic crust and to a lesser extent the underlying mantle typically becomes hydrated to varying degrees on the seafloor partly as the result of seafloor weathering and partly in response to hydrothermal circulation near the mid-ocean-ridge crest where it was originally formed as oceanic crust and underlying lithosphere subduct water is released by dehydration reactions along with water-soluble elements and trace elements this enriched fluid rises to metasomatize the overlying mantle wedge and leads to the formation of island arc basalts the subducting slab is depleted in these water-mobile elements e g k rb th pb and thus relatively enriched in elements that are not water-mobile e g ti nb ta compared to both mid-ocean ridge and island arc basalts ocean island basalts are also relatively enriched in immobile elements relative to the water-mobile elements this and other observations have been interpreted as indicating that the distinct geochemical signature of ocean island basalts results from inclusion of a component of subducted slab material this must have been recycled in the mantle then re-melted and incorporated in the lavas erupted in the context of the plume hypothesis subducted slabs are postulated to have been subducted down as far as the core-mantle boundary and transported back up to the surface in rising plumes in the plate hypothesis the slabs are postulated to have been recycled at shallower depths in the upper few hundred kilometers that make up the upper mantle however the plate hypothesis is inconsistent with both the geochemistry of shallow asthenosphere melts i e mid-ocean ridge basalts and with the isotopic compositions of ocean island basalts seismology edit in 2015 based on data from 273 large earthquakes researchers compiled a model based on full waveform tomography requiring the equivalent of 3 million hours of supercomputer time 26 due to computational limitations high-frequency data still could not be used and seismic data remained unavailable from much of the seafloor 26 nonetheless vertical plumes 400 c hotter than the surrounding rock were visualized under many hotspots including the pitcairn macdonald samoa tahiti marquesas galapagos cape verde and canary hotspots 27 they extended nearly vertically from the core-mantle boundary 2900 km depth to a possible layer of shearing and bending at 1000 km 26 they were detectable because they were 600 800 km wide more than three times the width expected from contemporary models 26 many of these plumes are in the large low-shear-velocity provinces under africa and the pacific while some other hotspots such as yellowstone were less clearly related to mantle features in the model 28 the unexpected size of the plumes leaves open the possibility that they may conduct the bulk of the earth s 44 terawatts of internal heat flow from the core to the surface and means that the lower mantle convects less than expected if at all it is possible that there is a compositional difference between plumes and the surrounding mantle that slows them down and broadens them 26 suggested mantle plume locations edit an example of plume locations suggested by one recent group 29 figure from foulger 2010 4 many different localities have been suggested to be underlain by mantle plumes and scientists cannot agree on a definitive list some scientists suggest that several tens of plumes exist 29 whereas others suggest that there are none 4 the theory was really inspired by the hawaiian volcano system hawaii is a large volcanic edifice in the center of the pacific ocean far from any plate boundaries its regular time-progressive chain of islands and seamounts superficially fits the plume theory well however it is almost unique on earth as nothing as extreme exists anywhere else the second strongest candidate for a plume location is often quoted to be iceland but according to opponents of the plume hypothesis its massive nature can be explained by plate tectonic forces along the mid-atlantic spreading center mantle plumes have been suggested as the source for flood basalts 30 31 these extremely rapid large scale eruptions of basaltic magmas have periodically formed continental flood basalt provinces on land and oceanic plateaus in the ocean basins such as the deccan traps 32 the siberian traps 33 the karoo ferrar flood basalts of gondwana 34 and the largest known continental flood basalt the central atlantic magmatic province camp 35 others 36 have pointed out the coincidence of many continental flood basalt events with continental rifting this is consistent with a system that tends toward equilibrium as matter rises in a mantle plume other material is drawn down into the mantle causing rifting 36 alternative hypotheses edit in parallel with the mantle plume model two alternative explanations for the observed phenomena have been considered the plate hypothesis and the impact hypothesis the plate hypothesis edit the plate hypothesis suggests that anomalous volcanism results from lithospheric extension that permits melt to rise passively from the asthenosphere beneath it is thus the conceptual inverse of the plume hypothesis attributing volcanism to shallow near-surface processes associated with plate tectonics rather than active processes arising at the core-mantle boundary the plate hypothesis argues that deep mantle plumes causing surface time-progressive volcanism do not exist clarification needed is paper really a claim to exclusive universality not in citation given 37 lithospheric extension is attributed to processes related to plate tectonics these processes are well understood at mid-ocean ridges where most of earth s volcanism occurs it is less commonly recognised that the plates themselves deform internally and can permit volcanism in those regions where the deformation is extensional well-known examples are the basin and range province in the western usa the east african rift valley and the rhine graben under this hypothesis variable volumes of magma are attributed to variations in chemical composition large volumes of volcanism corresponding to more easily molten mantle material rather than to temperature differences the plate hypothesis thus attributes all dubious discuss of earth s volcanism to a single process plate tectonics rather than to two independent processes plumes and plate tectonics but does not address issues of core mantle heat and or material transfer dubious discuss under the umbrella of the plate hypothesis the following sub-processes all of which can contribute to permitting surface volcanism are recognised 4 continental break-up fertility at mid-ocean ridges enhanced volcanism at plate boundary junctions small-scale sublithospheric convection oceanic intraplate extension slab tearing and break-off shallow mantle convection abrupt lateral changes in stress at structural discontinuities continental intraplate extension catastrophic lithospheric thinning sublithospheric melt ponding and draining the impact hypothesis edit in addition to these processes impact events such as ones that created the addams crater on venus and the sudbury igneous complex in canada are known to have caused melting and volcanism in the impact hypothesis it is proposed that some regions of hotspot volcanism can be triggered by certain large-body oceanic impacts which are able to penetrate the thinner oceanic lithosphere and flood basalt volcanism can be triggered by converging seismic energy focused at the antipodal point opposite major impact sites 38 impact-induced volcanism has not been adequately studied and comprises a separate causal category of terrestrial volcanism with implications for the study of hotspots and plate tectonics comparison of the hypotheses edit in 1997 it became possible using seismic tomography to image submerging tectonic slabs penetrating from the surface all the way to the core-mantle boundary 39 for the hawaii hotspot long-period seismic body wave diffraction tomography provided evidence that a mantle plume is responsible as had been proposed as early as 1971 40 for the yellowstone hotspot seismological evidence began to converge from 2011 in support of the plume model as concluded by james et al we favor a lower mantle plume as the origin for the yellowstone hotspot 37 41 data acquired through earthscope a program collecting high-resolution seismic data throughout the contiguous united states has accelerated acceptance of a plume underlying yellowstone 42 43 although there is strong evidence that at least two deep mantle plumes rise to the core-mantle boundary confirmation that other hypotheses can be dismissed may require similar tomographic evidence for other hot spots see also
