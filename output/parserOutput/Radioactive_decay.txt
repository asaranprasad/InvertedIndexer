teller thomson walton wigner v t radioactive decay also known as nuclear decay or radioactivity is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy in terms of mass in its rest frame by emitting radiation such as an alpha particle beta particle with neutrino or only a neutrino in the case of electron capture gamma ray or electron in the case of internal conversion a material containing such unstable nuclei is considered radioactive certain highly excited short-lived nuclear states can decay through neutron emission or more rarely proton emission radioactive decay is a stochastic i e random process at the level of single atoms in that according to quantum theory it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay 1 2 3 regardless of how long the atom has existed however for a collection of atoms the collection s expected decay rate is characterized in terms of their measured decay constants or half-lives this is the basis of radiometric dating the half-lives of radioactive atoms have no known upper limit spanning a time range of over 55 orders of magnitude from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe a radioactive nucleus with zero spin can have no defined orientation and hence emits the total momentum of its decay products isotropically all directions and without bias if there are multiple particles produced during a single decay as in beta decay their relative angular distribution or spin directions may not be isotropic decay products from a nucleus with spin may be distributed non-isotropically with respect to that spin direction either because of an external influence such as an electromagnetic field or because the nucleus was produced in a dynamic process that constrained the direction of its spin such a parent process could be a previous decay or a nuclear reaction 4 5 6 note 1 the decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide or parent radioisotope note 2 and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons or both when the number of protons changes an atom of a different chemical element is created the first decay processes to be discovered were alpha decay beta decay and gamma decay alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle helium nucleus this is the most common process of emitting nucleons but highly excited nuclei can eject single nucleons or in the case of cluster decay specific light nuclei of other elements beta decay occurs in two ways i beta-minus decay when the nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino in a process that changes a neutron to a proton or ii beta-plus decay when the nucleus emits a positron and a neutrino in a process that changes a proton to a neutron highly excited neutron-rich nuclei formed as the product of other types of decay occasionally lose energy by way of neutron emission resulting in a change from one isotope to another of the same element the nucleus may capture an orbiting electron causing a proton to convert into a neutron in a process called electron capture all of these processes result in a well-defined nuclear transmutation by contrast there are radioactive decay processes that do not result in a nuclear transmutation the energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a gamma ray in a process called gamma decay or that energy may be lost when the nucleus interacts with an orbital electron causing its ejection from the atom in a process called internal conversion another type of radioactive decay results in products that vary appearing as two or more fragments of the original nucleus with a range of possible masses this decay called spontaneous fission happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two or occasionally three smaller daughter nuclei and generally leads to the emission of gamma rays neutrons or other particles from those products for a summary table showing the number of stable and radioactive nuclides in each category see radionuclide there are 29 naturally occurring chemical elements on earth that are radioactive they are those that contain 34 radionuclides that date before the time of formation of the solar system and are known as primordial nuclides well-known examples are uranium and thorium but also included are naturally occurring long-lived radioisotopes such as potassium-40 another 50 or so shorter-lived radionuclides such as radium and radon found on earth are the products of decay chains that began with the primordial nuclides or are the product of ongoing cosmogenic processes such as the production of carbon-14 from nitrogen-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays radionuclides may also be produced artificially in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors resulting in 650 of these with half-lives of over an hour

1907 radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the french scientist henri becquerel while working with phosphorescent materials 7 these materials glow in the dark after exposure to light and he suspected that the glow produced in cathode ray tubes by x-rays might be associated with phosphorescence he wrapped a photographic plate in black paper and placed various phosphorescent salts on it all results were negative until he used uranium salts the uranium salts caused a blackening of the plate in spite of the plate being wrapped in black paper these radiations were given the name becquerel rays it soon became clear that the blackening of the plate had nothing to do with phosphorescence as the blackening was also produced by non-phosphorescent salts of uranium and metallic uranium it became clear from these experiments that there was a form of invisible radiation that could pass through paper and was causing the plate to react as if exposed to light at first it seemed as though the new radiation was similar to the then recently discovered x-rays further research by becquerel ernest rutherford paul villard pierre curie marie curie and others showed that this form of radioactivity was significantly more complicated rutherford was the first to realize that all such elements decay in accordance with the same mathematical exponential formula rutherford and his student frederick soddy were the first to realize that many decay processes resulted in the transmutation of one element to another subsequently the radioactive displacement law of fajans and soddy was formulated to describe the products of alpha and beta decay 8 9 the early researchers also discovered that many other chemical elements besides uranium have radioactive isotopes a systematic search for the total radioactivity in uranium ores also guided pierre and marie curie to isolate two new elements polonium and radium except for the radioactivity of radium the chemical similarity of radium to barium made these two elements difficult to distinguish marie and pierre curie s study of radioactivity is an important factor in science and medicine after their research on becquerel s rays led them to the discovery of both radium and polonium they coined the term radioactivity 10 their research on the penetrating rays in uranium and the discovery of radium launched an era of using radium for the treatment of cancer their exploration of radium could be seen as the first peaceful use of nuclear energy and the start of modern nuclear medicine 10 early health dangers edit taking an x-ray image with early crookes tube apparatus in 1896 the crookes tube is visible in the centre the standing man is viewing his hand with a fluoroscope screen this was a common way of setting up the tube no precautions against radiation exposure are being taken its hazards were not known at the time the dangers of ionizing radiation due to radioactivity and x-rays were not immediately recognized x-rays edit the discovery of x rays by wilhelm r ntgen in 1895 led to widespread experimentation by scientists physicians and inventors many people began recounting stories of burns hair loss and worse in technical journals as early as 1896 in february of that year professor daniel and dr dudley of vanderbilt university performed an experiment involving x-raying dudley s head that resulted in his hair loss a report by dr h d hawks of his suffering severe hand and chest burns in an x-ray demonstration was the first of many other reports in electrical review 11 other experimenters including elihu thomson and nikola tesla also reported burns thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an x-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain swelling and blistering 12 other effects including ultraviolet rays and ozone were sometimes blamed for the damage 13 and many physicians still claimed that there were no effects from x-ray exposure at all 12 despite this there were some early systematic hazard investigations and as early as 1902 william herbert rollins wrote almost despairingly that his warnings about the dangers involved in the careless use of x-rays were not being heeded either by industry or by his colleagues by this time rollins had proved that x-rays could kill experimental animals could cause a pregnant guinea pig to abort and that they could kill a fetus 14 he also stressed that animals vary in susceptibility to the external action of x-light and warned that these differences be considered when patients were treated by means of x-rays radioactive substances edit radioactivity is characteristic of elements with large atomic number elements with at least one stable isotope are shown in light blue green shows elements whose most stable isotope has a half-life measured in millions of years yellow and orange are progressively less stable with half-lives in thousands or hundreds of years down toward one day red and purple show highly and extremely radioactive elements where the most stable isotopes exhibit half-lives measured on the order of one day and much less however the biological effects of radiation due to radioactive substances were less easy to gauge this gave the opportunity for many physicians and corporations to market radioactive substances as patent medicines examples were radium enema treatments and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics marie curie protested against this sort of treatment warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood curie later died from aplastic anaemia likely caused by exposure to ionizing radiation by the 1930s after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death of radium treatment enthusiasts radium-containing medicinal products had been largely removed from the market radioactive quackery radiation protection edit only a year after r ntgen s discovery of x rays the american engineer wolfram fuchs 1896 gave what is probably the first protection advice but it was not until 1925 that the first international congress of radiology icr was held and considered establishing international protection standards the effects of radiation on genes including the effect of cancer risk were recognized much later in 1927 hermann joseph muller published research showing genetic effects and in 1946 was awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his findings the second icr was held in stockholm in 1928 and proposed the adoption of the rontgen unit and the international x-ray and radium protection committee ixrpc was formed rolf sievert was named chairman but a driving force was george kaye of the british national physical laboratory the committee met in 1931 1934 and 1937 after world war ii the increased range and quantity of radioactive substances being handled as a result of military and civil nuclear programmes led to large groups of occupational workers and the public being potentially exposed to harmful levels of ionising radiation this was considered at the first post-war icr convened in london in 1950 when the present international commission on radiological protection icrp was born 15 since then the icrp has developed the present international system of radiation protection covering all aspects of radiation hazard units of radioactivity edit graphic showing relationships between radioactivity and detected ionizing radiation the international system of units si unit of radioactive activity is the becquerel bq named in honor of the scientist henri becquerel one bq is defined as one transformation or decay or disintegration per second an older unit of radioactivity is the curie ci which was originally defined as the quantity or mass of radium emanation in equilibrium with one gram of radium element 16 today the curie is defined as 7010370000000000000 3.7 1010 disintegrations per second so that 1 curie ci 7010370000000000000 3.7 1010 bq for radiological protection purposes although the united states nuclear regulatory commission permits the use of the unit curie alongside si units 17 the european union european units of measurement directives required that its use for public health purposes be phased out by 31 december 1985 18 the effects of ionizing radiation are often measured in units of gray for mechanical or sievert for damage to tissue types of decay edit alpha particles may be completely stopped by a sheet of paper beta particles by aluminium shielding gamma rays can only be reduced by much more substantial mass such as a very thick layer of lead early researchers found that an electric or magnetic field could split radioactive emissions into three types of beams the rays were given the names alpha beta and gamma in increasing order of their ability to penetrate matter alpha decay is observed only in heavier elements of atomic number 52 tellurium and greater with the exception of beryllium-8 which decays to two alpha particles the other two types of decay are produced by all of the elements lead atomic number 82 is the heaviest element to have any isotopes stable to the limit of measurement to radioactive decay radioactive decay is seen in all isotopes of all elements of atomic number 83 bismuth or greater bismuth however is only very slightly radioactive with a half-life greater than the age of the universe radioisotopes with extremely long half-lives are considered effectively stable for practical purposes transition diagram for decay modes of a radionuclide with neutron number n and atomic number z shown are p and n0 emissions ec denotes electron capture types of radioactive decay related to n and z numbers in analysing the nature of the decay products it was obvious from the direction of the electromagnetic forces applied to the radiations by external magnetic and electric fields that alpha particles carried a positive charge beta particles carried a negative charge and gamma rays were neutral from the magnitude of deflection it was clear that alpha particles were much more massive than beta particles passing alpha particles through a very thin glass window and trapping them in a discharge tube allowed researchers to study the emission spectrum of the captured particles and ultimately proved that alpha particles are helium nuclei other experiments showed beta radiation resulting from decay and cathode rays were high-speed electrons likewise gamma radiation and x-rays were found to be high-energy electromagnetic radiation the relationship between the types of decays also began to be examined for example gamma decay was almost always found to be associated with other types of decay and occurred at about the same time or afterwards gamma decay as a separate phenomenon with its own half-life now termed isomeric transition was found in natural radioactivity to be a result of the gamma decay of excited metastable nuclear isomers which were in turn created from other types of decay although alpha beta and gamma radiations were most commonly found other types of emission were eventually discovered shortly after the discovery of the positron in cosmic ray products it was realized that the same process that operates in classical beta decay can also produce positrons positron emission along with neutrinos classical beta decay produces antineutrinos in a more common analogous process called electron capture some proton-rich nuclides were found to capture their own atomic electrons instead of emitting positrons and subsequently these nuclides emit only a neutrino and a gamma ray from the excited nucleus and often also auger electrons and characteristic x-rays as a result of the re-ordering of electrons to fill the place of the missing captured electron these types of decay involve the nuclear capture of electrons or emission of electrons or positrons and thus acts to move a nucleus toward the ratio of neutrons to protons that has the least energy for a given total number of nucleons this consequently produces a more stable lower energy nucleus a theoretical process of positron capture analogous to electron capture is possible in antimatter atoms but has not been observed as complex antimatter atoms beyond antihelium are not experimentally available 19 such a decay would require antimatter atoms at least as complex as beryllium-7 which is the lightest known isotope of normal matter to undergo decay by electron capture shortly after the discovery of the neutron in 1932 enrico fermi realized that certain rare beta-decay reactions immediately yield neutrons as a decay particle neutron emission isolated proton emission was eventually observed in some elements it was also found that some heavy elements may undergo spontaneous fission into products that vary in composition in a phenomenon called cluster decay specific combinations of neutrons and protons other than alpha particles helium nuclei were found to be spontaneously emitted from atoms other types of radioactive decay were found to emit previously-seen particles but via different mechanisms an example is internal conversion which results in an initial electron emission and then often further characteristic x-rays and auger electrons emissions although the internal conversion process involves neither beta nor gamma decay a neutrino is not emitted and none of the electron s and photon s emitted originate in the nucleus even though the energy to emit all of them does originate there internal conversion decay like isomeric transition gamma decay and neutron emission involves the release of energy by an excited nuclide without the transmutation of one element into another rare events that involve a combination of two beta-decay type events happening simultaneously are known see below any decay process that does not violate the conservation of energy or momentum laws and perhaps other particle conservation laws is permitted to happen although not all have been detected an interesting example discussed in a final section is bound state beta decay of rhenium-187 in this process beta electron-decay of the parent nuclide is not accompanied by beta electron emission because the beta particle has been captured into the k-shell of the emitting atom an antineutrino is emitted as in all negative beta decays radionuclides can undergo a number of different reactions these are summarized in the following table a nucleus with mass number a and atomic number z is represented as a z the column daughter nucleus indicates the difference between the new nucleus and the original nucleus thus a 1 z means that the mass number is one less than before but the atomic number is the same as before if energy circumstances are favorable a given radionuclide may undergo many competing types of decay with some atoms decaying by one route and others decaying by another an example is copper-64 which has 29 protons and 35 neutrons which decays with a half-life of about 12.7 hours this isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron so either the proton or the neutron can decay to the opposite particle this particular nuclide though not all nuclides in this situation is almost equally likely to decay through positron emission 18 or through electron capture 43 as it does through electron emission 39 the excited energy states resulting from these decays which fail to end in a ground energy state also produce later internal conversion and gamma decay in almost 0.5 of the time more common in heavy nuclides is competition between alpha and beta decay the daughter nuclides will then normally decay through beta or alpha respectively to end up in the same place mode of decay participating particles daughter nucleus decays with emission of nucleons alpha decay an alpha particle a 4 z 2 emitted from nucleus a 4 z 2 proton emission a proton ejected from nucleus a 1 z 1 neutron emission a neutron ejected from nucleus a 1 z double proton emission two protons ejected from nucleus simultaneously a 2 z 2 spontaneous fission nucleus disintegrates into two or more smaller nuclei and other particles cluster decay nucleus emits a specific type of smaller nucleus a1 z1 which is larger than an alpha particle a a1 z z1 a1 z1 different modes of beta decay decay a nucleus emits an electron and an electron antineutrino a z 1 positron emission decay a nucleus emits a positron and an electron neutrino a z 1 electron capture a nucleus captures an orbiting electron and emits a neutrino the daughter nucleus is left in an excited unstable state a z 1 bound state beta decay a free neutron or nucleus beta decays to electron and antineutrino but the electron is not emitted as it is captured into an empty k-shell the daughter nucleus is left in an excited and unstable state this process is a minority of free neutron decays 0.0004 due to the low energy of hydrogen ionization and is suppressed except in ionized atoms that have k-shell vacancies a z 1 double beta decay a nucleus emits two electrons and two antineutrinos a z 2 double electron capture a nucleus absorbs two orbital electrons and emits two neutrinos the daughter nucleus is left in an excited and unstable state a z 2 electron capture with positron emission a nucleus absorbs one orbital electron emits one positron and two neutrinos a z 2 double positron emission a nucleus emits two positrons and two neutrinos a z 2 transitions between states of the same nucleus isomeric transition excited nucleus releases a high-energy photon gamma ray a z internal conversion excited nucleus transfers energy to an orbital electron which is subsequently ejected from the atom a z radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass once the released energy the disintegration energy has escaped in some way although decay energy is sometimes defined as associated with the difference between the mass of the parent nuclide products and the mass of the decay products this is true only of rest mass measurements where some energy has been removed from the product system this is true because the decay energy must always carry mass with it wherever it appears see mass in special relativity according to the formula e mc2 the decay energy is initially released as the energy of emitted photons plus the kinetic energy of massive emitted particles that is particles that have rest mass if these particles come to thermal equilibrium with their surroundings and photons are absorbed then the decay energy is transformed to thermal energy which retains its mass decay energy therefore remains associated with a certain measure of mass of the decay system called invariant mass which does not change during the decay even though the energy of decay is distributed among decay particles the energy of photons the kinetic energy of emitted particles and later the thermal energy of the surrounding matter all contribute to the invariant mass of the system thus while the sum of the rest masses of the particles is not conserved in radioactive decay the system mass and system invariant mass and also the system total energy is conserved throughout any decay process this is a restatement of the equivalent laws of conservation of energy and conservation of mass radioactive decay rates edit the decay rate or activity of a radioactive substance is characterized by constant quantities the half-life t1 2 is the time taken for the activity of a given amount of a radioactive substance to decay to half of its initial value see list of nuclides the decay constant lambda the reciprocal of the mean lifetime sometimes referred to as simply decay rate the mean lifetime tau the average lifetime 1 e life of a radioactive particle before decay although these are constants they are associated with the statistical behavior of populations of atoms in consequence predictions using these constants are less accurate for minuscule samples of atoms in principle a half-life a third-life or even a 1 2 -life can be used in exactly the same way as half-life but the mean life and half-life t1 2 have been adopted as standard times associated with exponential decay time-variable quantities total activity a is the number of decays per unit time of a radioactive sample number of particles n is the total number of particles in the sample specific activity sa number of decays per unit time per amount of substance of the sample at time set to zero t 0 amount of substance can be the mass volume or moles of the initial sample these are

of radioactive decay edit this article reads like a textbook and may require cleanup please help to make it neutral in tone and meet wikipedia s quality standards universal law of radioactive decay edit radioactivity is one very frequently given example of exponential decay the law describes the statistical behaviour of a large number of nuclides rather than individual atoms in the following formalism the number of nuclides or the nuclide population n is of course a discrete variable a natural number but for any physical sample n is so large that it can be treated as a continuous variable differential calculus is used to model the behaviour of nuclear decay the mathematics of radioactive decay depend on a key assumption that a nucleus of a radionuclide has no memory or way of translating its history into its present behavior a nucleus does not age with the passage of time thus the probability of its breaking down does not increase with time but stays constant no matter how long the nucleus has existed this constant probability may vary greatly between different types of nuclei leading to the many different observed decay rates however whatever the probability is it does not change this is in marked contrast to complex objects which do show aging such as automobiles and humans these systems do have a chance of breakdown per unit of time that increases from the moment they begin their existence one-decay process edit consider the case of a nuclide a that decays into another b by some process a b emission of other particles like electron neutrinos e and electrons e as in beta decay are irrelevant in what follows the decay of an unstable nucleus is entirely random and it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay however it is equally likely to decay at any instant in time therefore given a sample of a particular radioisotope the number of decay events dn expected to occur in a small interval of time dt is proportional to the number of atoms

previous equation cannot be applied to the decay chain but can be generalized as follows since a decays into b then b decays into c the activity of a adds to the total number of b nuclides in the present sample before those b nuclides decay and reduce the number of nuclides leading to the later sample in other words the number of second generation nuclei b increases as a result of the first

n 0 e t displaystyle n n 0 e - lambda t n 0 e -t tau the half-life is related to the decay constant as follows set n n0 2 and t t1 2 to obtain t 1 2 ln 2 ln 2 displaystyle t 1 2 frac ln 2 lambda tau ln 2 this relationship between the half-life and the decay constant shows that highly radioactive substances are quickly spent while those that radiate weakly endure longer half-lives of known radionuclides vary widely from more than 1019 years such as for the very nearly stable nuclide 209bi to 10 23 seconds for highly unstable ones the factor of ln 2 in the above relations results from the fact that the concept of half-life is merely a way of selecting a different base other than the natural base e for the lifetime expression the time constant is the e -1 -life the time until only 1 e remains about 36.8 rather than the 50 in the half-life of a radionuclide thus is longer than t1 2 the following equation can be shown to be valid n t n 0 e t n 0 2 t t 1 2 displaystyle n t n 0 e -t tau n 0 ,2 -t t 1 2 since radioactive decay is exponential with a constant probability each process could as easily be described with a different constant time period that for example gave its 1 3 -life how long until only 1 3 is left or 1 10 -life a time period until only 10 is left and so on thus the choice of and t1 2 for marker-times are only for convenience and from convention they reflect a fundamental principle only in so much as they show that the same proportion of a given radioactive substance will decay during any time-period that one chooses mathematically the nth life for the above situation would be found in the same way as above by setting n n0 n t t1 n and substituting into the decay solution to obtain t 1 n ln n ln n displaystyle t 1 n frac ln n lambda tau ln n example edit a sample of 14c has a half-life of 5,730 years and a decay rate of 14 disintegration per minute dpm per gram of natural carbon if an artifact is found to have radioactivity of 4 dpm per gram of its present c we can find the approximate age of the object using the above equation n n 0 e t displaystyle n n 0 e -t tau where n n 0 4 14 0.286 displaystyle frac n n 0 4 14 approx 0.286 t 1 2 ln 2 8267 displaystyle tau frac t 1 2 ln 2 approx 8267 years t ln n n 0 10356 displaystyle t - tau ln frac n n 0 approx 10356 years changing decay rates edit the radioactive decay modes of electron capture and internal conversion are known to be slightly sensitive to chemical and environmental effects that change the electronic structure of the atom which in turn affects the presence of 1s and 2s electrons that participate in the decay process a small number of mostly light nuclides are affected for example chemical bonds can affect the rate of electron capture to a small degree in general less than 1 depending on the proximity of electrons to the nucleus in 7be a difference of 0.9 has been observed between half-lives in metallic and insulating environments 24 this relatively large effect is because beryllium is a small atom whose valence electrons are in 2s atomic orbitals which are subject to electron capture in 7be because like all s atomic orbitals in all atoms they naturally penetrate into the nucleus in 1992 jung et al of the darmstadt heavy-ion research group observed an accelerated decay of 163dy66 although neutral 163dy is a stable isotope the fully ionized 163dy66 undergoes decay into the k and l shells to 163ho66 with a half-life of 47 days 25 rhenium-187 is another spectacular example 187re normally beta decays to 187os with a half-life of 41.6 109 years 26 but studies using fully ionised 187re atoms bare nuclei have found that this can decrease to only 33 years this is attributed to bound-state decay of the fully ionised atom the electron is emitted into the k-shell 1s atomic orbital which cannot occur for neutral atoms in which all low-lying bound states are occupied 27 decay rate of radon-222 as a function of date and time of day the color-bar gives the power of the observed signal and represents 4 seasonal decay rate variation a number of experiments have found that decay rates of other modes of artificial and naturally occurring radioisotopes are to a high degree of precision unaffected by external conditions such as temperature pressure the chemical environment and electric magnetic or gravitational fields 28 comparison of laboratory experiments over the last century studies of the oklo natural nuclear reactor which exemplified the effects of thermal neutrons on nuclear decay and astrophysical observations of the luminosity decays of distant supernovae which occurred far away so the light has taken a great deal of time to reach us for example strongly indicate that unperturbed decay rates have been constant at least to within the limitations of small experimental errors as a function of time as well citation needed recent results suggest the possibility that decay rates might have a weak dependence on environmental factors it has been suggested that measurements of decay rates of silicon-32 manganese-54 and radium-226 exhibit small seasonal variations of the order of 0.1 29 30 31 while the decay of radon-222 is reported to exhibit large 4 peak-to-peak seasonal variations 32 proposed to be related to either solar flare activity or the distance from the sun however such measurements are highly susceptible to systematic errors and a subsequent paper 33 has found no evidence for such correlations in seven other isotopes 22na 44ti 108ag 121sn 133ba 241am 238pu and sets upper limits on the size of any such effects gsi anomaly edit an unexpected series of experimental results for the rate of decay of heavy highly charged radioactive ions circulating in a storage ring has provoked theoretical activity in an effort to find a convincing explanation the rates of weak decay of two radioactive species with half lives of about 40 s and 200 s are found to have a significant oscillatory modulation with a period of about 7 s 34 the observed phenomenon is known as the gsi anomaly as the storage ring is a facility at the gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research in darmstadt germany as the decay process produces an electron neutrino some of the proposed explanations for the observed rate oscillation invoke neutrino properties initial ideas related to flavour oscillation met with skepticism 35 a more recent proposal involves mass differences between neutrino mass eigenstates 36 theoretical basis of decay phenomena edit this section possibly contains original research please by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations statements consisting only of original research should be removed october 2014 learn how and when to remove this template message the neutrons and protons that constitute nuclei as well as other particles that approach close enough to them are governed by several interactions the strong nuclear force not observed at the familiar macroscopic scale is the most powerful force over subatomic distances the electrostatic force is almost always significant and in the case of beta decay the weak nuclear force is also involved the interplay of these forces produces a number of different phenomena in which energy may be released by rearrangement of particles in the nucleus or else the change of one type of particle into others these rearrangements and transformations may be hindered energetically so that they do not occur immediately in certain cases random quantum vacuum fluctuations are theorized to promote relaxation to a lower energy state the decay in a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling radioactive decay half-life of nuclides has been measured over timescales of 55 orders of magnitude from 2.3 10 23 seconds for hydrogen-7 to 6.9 1031 seconds for tellurium-128 37 the limits of these timescales are set by the sensitivity of instrumentation only and there are no known natural limits to how brief or long a decay half-life for radioactive decay of a radionuclide may be the decay process like all hindered energy transformations may be analogized by a snowfield on a mountain while friction between the ice crystals may be supporting the snow s weight the system is inherently unstable with regard to a state of lower potential energy a disturbance would thus facilitate the path to a state of greater entropy the system will move towards the ground state producing heat and the total energy will be distributable over a larger number of quantum states thus resulting in an avalanche the total energy does not change in this process but because of the second law of thermodynamics avalanches have only been observed in one direction and that is toward the ground state the state with the largest number of ways in which the available energy could be distributed such a collapse a gamma-ray decay event requires a specific activation energy for a snow avalanche this energy comes as a disturbance from outside the system although such disturbances can be arbitrarily small in the case of an excited atomic nucleus decaying by gamma radiation in a spontaneous emission of electromagnetic radiation the arbitrarily small disturbance comes from quantum vacuum fluctuations 38 a radioactive nucleus or any excited system in quantum mechanics is unstable and can thus spontaneously stabilize to a less-excited system the resulting transformation alters the structure of the nucleus and results in the emission of either a photon or a high-velocity particle that has mass such as an electron alpha particle or other type citation needed occurrence and applications edit according to the big bang theory stable isotopes of the lightest five elements h he and traces of li be and b were produced very shortly after the emergence of the universe in a process called big bang nucleosynthesis these lightest stable nuclides including deuterium survive to today but any radioactive isotopes of the light elements produced in the big bang such as tritium have long since decayed isotopes of elements heavier than boron were not produced at all in the big bang and these first five elements do not have any long-lived radioisotopes thus all radioactive nuclei are therefore relatively young with respect to the birth of the universe having formed later in various other types of nucleosynthesis in stars in particular supernovae and also during ongoing interactions between stable isotopes and energetic particles for example carbon-14 a radioactive nuclide with a half-life of only 5,730 years is constantly produced in earth s upper atmosphere due to interactions between cosmic rays and nitrogen nuclides that are produced by radioactive decay are called radiogenic nuclides whether they themselves are stable or not there exist stable radiogenic nuclides that were formed from short-lived extinct radionuclides in the early solar system 39 40 the extra presence of these stable radiogenic nuclides such as xe-129 from primordial i-129 against the background of primordial stable nuclides can be inferred by various means radioactive decay has been put to use in the technique of radioisotopic labeling which is used to track the passage of a chemical substance through a complex system such as a living organism a sample of the substance is synthesized with a high concentration of unstable atoms the presence of the substance in one or another part of the system is determined by detecting the locations of decay events on the premise that radioactive decay is truly random rather than merely chaotic it has been used in hardware random-number generators because the process is not thought to vary significantly in mechanism over time it is also a valuable tool in estimating the absolute ages of certain materials for geological materials the radioisotopes and some of their decay products become trapped when a rock solidifies and can then later be used subject to many well-known qualifications to estimate the date of the solidification these include checking the results of several simultaneous processes and their products against each other within the same sample in a similar fashion and also subject to qualification the rate of formation of carbon-14 in various eras the date of formation of organic matter within a certain period related to the isotope s half-life may be estimated because the carbon-14 becomes trapped when the organic matter grows and incorporates the new carbon-14 from the air thereafter the amount of carbon-14 in organic matter decreases according to decay processes that may also be independently cross-checked by other means such as checking the carbon-14 in individual tree rings for example szilard chalmers effect edit the szilard chalmers effect is defined as the breaking of a chemical bond between an atom and the molecule that the atom is part of as a result of a nuclear reaction of the atom the effect can be used to separate isotopes by chemical means the discovery of this effect is due to l szil rd and t a chalmers 41 origins of radioactive nuclides edit radioactive primordial nuclides found in the earth are residues from ancient supernova explosions that occurred before the formation of the solar system they are the fraction of radionuclides that survived from that time through the formation of the primordial solar nebula through planet accretion and up to the present time the naturally occurring short-lived radiogenic radionuclides found in today s rocks are the daughters of those radioactive primordial nuclides another minor source of naturally occurring radioactive nuclides are cosmogenic nuclides that are formed by cosmic ray bombardment of material in the earth s atmosphere or crust the decay of the radionuclides in rocks of the earth s mantle and crust contribute significantly to earth s internal heat budget decay chains and multiple modes edit the daughter nuclide of a decay event may also be unstable radioactive in this case it too will decay producing radiation the resulting second daughter nuclide may also be radioactive this can lead to a sequence of several decay events called a decay chain see this article for specific details of important natural decay chains eventually a stable nuclide is produced gamma-ray energy spectrum of uranium ore inset gamma-rays are emitted by decaying nuclides and the gamma-ray energy can be used to characterize the decay which nuclide is decaying to which here using the gamma-ray spectrum several nuclides that are typical of the decay chain of 238u have been identified 226ra 214pb 214bi an example is the natural decay chain of 238u uranium-238 decays through alpha-emission with a half-life of 4.5 billion years to thorium-234 which decays through beta-emission with a half-life of 24 days to protactinium-234 which decays through beta-emission with a half-life of 1.2 minutes to uranium-234 which decays through alpha-emission with a half-life of 240 thousand years to thorium-230 which decays through alpha-emission with a half-life of 77 thousand years to radium-226 which decays through alpha-emission with a half-life of 1.6 thousand years to radon-222 which decays through alpha-emission with a half-life of 3.8 days to polonium-218 which decays through alpha-emission with a half-life of 3.1 minutes to lead-214 which decays through beta-emission with a half-life of 27 minutes to bismuth-214 which decays through beta-emission with a half-life of 20 minutes to polonium-214 which decays through alpha-emission with a half-life of 160 microseconds to lead-210 which decays through beta-emission with a half-life of 22 years to bismuth-210 which decays through beta-emission with a half-life of 5 days to polonium-210 which decays through alpha-emission with a half-life of 140 days to lead-206 which is a stable nuclide some radionuclides may have several different paths of decay for example approximately 36 of bismuth-212 decays through alpha-emission to thallium-208 while approximately 64 of bismuth-212 decays through beta-emission to polonium-212 both thallium-208 and polonium-212 are radioactive daughter products of bismuth-212 and both decay directly to stable lead-208 associated hazard warning signs edit the trefoil symbol used to indicate ionising radiation 2007 iso radioactivity danger symbol
