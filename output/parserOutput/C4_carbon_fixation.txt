and enters the chloroplasts of bundle sheath cells 3 it is then broken down releasing carbon dioxide and producing pyruvate carbon dioxide combines with ribulose bisphosphate and proceeds to the calvin cycle 4 pyruvate re-enters the mesophyll cell it then reacts with atp to produce the beginning compound of the c4 cycle c4 carbon fixation or the hatch-slack pathway is a photosynthetic process in some plants it is the first step in extracting carbon from carbon dioxide to be able to use it in sugar and other biomolecules it is one of three known processes for carbon fixation the c4 in one of the names refers to the 4-carbon molecule that is the first product of this type of carbon fixation c4 fixation is an elaboration of the more common c3 carbon fixation and is believed to have evolved more recently c4 overcomes the tendency of the enzyme rubisco to wastefully fix oxygen rather than carbon dioxide in the process of photorespiration this is achieved by ensuring that rubisco works in an environment where there is a lot of carbon dioxide and very little oxygen co2 is shuttled via malate or aspartate from mesophyll cells to bundle-sheath cells in these bundle-sheath cells co2 is released by decarboxylation of the malate c4 plants use pep carboxylase to capture more co2 in the mesophyll cells pep carboxylase 3 carbons binds to co2 to make oxaloacetic acid oaa the oaa then makes malate 4 carbons malate enters bundle sheath cells and releases the co2 these additional steps however require more energy in the form of atp using this extra energy c4 plants are able to more efficiently fix carbon in drought high temperatures and limitations of nitrogen or co2 since the more common c3 pathway does not require this extra energy it is more efficient in the other conditions the naming hatch-slack pathway is in honor of marshall davidson hatch and c r slack who elucidated it in australia in 1966 1 contents 1 c4 pathway 2 c4 kranz leaf anatomy 3 the evolution

pathway pepck type c 4 pathway the first experiments indicating that some plants do not use c3 carbon fixation but instead produce malate and aspartate in the first step of carbon fixation were done in the 1950s and early 1960s by hugo p kortschak 2 and yuri karpilov 3 the c4 pathway was elucidated by marshall davidson hatch and c r slack in australia in 1966 it is sometimes called the hatch-slack pathway 4 in c3 plants the first step in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis involves the fixation of co2 by the enzyme rubisco into 3-phosphoglycerate however due to the dual carboxylase and oxygenase activity of rubisco some part of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy in what is known as photorespiration in order to bypass the photorespiration pathway c4 plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver co2 to the rubisco enzyme they utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well instead of direct fixation to rubisco in the calvin cycle co2 is incorporated into a 4-carbon organic acid which has the ability to regenerate co2 in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells bundle sheath cells can then utilize this co2 to generate carbohydrates by the conventional c3 pathway the first step in the pathway is the conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate pep by the enzyme pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase this reaction requires inorganic phosphate and atp plus pyruvate producing phosphoenolpyruvate amp and inorganic pyrophosphate ppi the next step is the fixation of co2 into oxaloacetate by the enzyme pep carboxylase both of these steps occur in the mesophyll cells pyruvate p i atp pep amp pp i pep co 2 oxaloacetate pep carboxylase has a lower km for hco 3 and hence higher affinity than rubisco furthermore o2 is a very poor substrate for this enzyme thus at relatively low concentrations of co2 most co2 will be fixed by this pathway the product is usually converted to malate a simple organic compound which is transported to the bundle-sheath cells surrounding a nearby vein here it is decarboxylated to produce co2 and pyruvate the co2 now enters the calvin cycle and the pyruvate is transported back to the mesophyll cell since every co2 molecule has to be fixed twice first by 4-carbon organic acid and second by rubisco the c4 pathway uses more energy than the c3 pathway the c3 pathway requires 18 molecules of atp for the synthesis of one molecule of glucose whereas the c4 pathway requires 30 molecules of atp this energy debt is more than paid for by avoiding losing more than half of photosynthetic carbon in photorespiration as occurs in some tropical plants citation needed making it an adaptive mechanism for minimizing the loss there are several variants of this pathway the 4-carbon acid transported from mesophyll cells may be malate as above or aspartate the 3-carbon acid transported back from bundle-sheath cells may be pyruvate as above or alanine the enzyme that catalyses decarboxylation in bundle-sheath cells differs in maize and sugarcane the enzyme is nadp-malic enzyme in millet it is nad-malic enzyme and in panicum maximum it is pep carboxykinase c4 kranz leaf anatomy edit cross section of a maize leaf a c 4 plant kranz anatomy rings of cells shown drawing based on microscopic images courtesy of cambridge university plant sciences department the c4 plants often possess a characteristic leaf anatomy called kranz anatomy from the german word for wreath their vascular bundles are surrounded by two rings of cells the inner ring called bundle sheath cells contains starch-rich chloroplasts lacking grana which differ from those in mesophyll cells present as the outer ring hence the chloroplasts are called dimorphic the primary function of kranz anatomy is to provide a site in which co2 can be concentrated around rubisco thereby avoiding photorespiration in order to maintain a significantly higher co2 concentration in the bundle sheath compared to the mesophyll the boundary layer of the kranz has a low conductance to co2 a property that may be enhanced by the presence of suberin 5 although most c4 plants exhibit kranz anatomy there are however a few species that operate a limited c4 cycle without any distinct bundle sheath tissue suaeda aralocaspica bienertia cycloptera bienertia sinuspersici and bienertia kavirense all chenopods are terrestrial plants that inhabit dry salty depressions in the deserts of the middle east these plants have been shown to operate single-cell c4 co2-concentrating mechanisms which are unique among the known c4 mechanisms 6 7 8 9 although the cytology of both genera differs slightly the basic principle is that fluid-filled vacuoles are employed to divide the cell into two separate areas carboxylation enzymes in the cytosol can therefore be kept separate from decarboxylase enzymes and rubisco in the chloroplasts and a diffusive barrier can be established between the chloroplasts which contain rubisco and the cytosol this enables a bundle-sheath-type area and a mesophyll-type area to be established within a single cell although this does allow a limited c4 cycle to operate it is relatively inefficient with the occurrence of much leakage of co2 from around rubisco there is also evidence for the exhibiting of inducible c4 photosynthesis by non-kranz aquatic macrophyte hydrilla verticillata under warm conditions although the mechanism by which co2 leakage from around rubisco is minimised is currently uncertain 10 the evolution and advantages of the c4 pathway edit c4 plants have a competitive advantage over plants possessing the more common c3 carbon fixation pathway under conditions of drought high temperatures and nitrogen or co2 limitation when grown in the same environment at 30 c c3 grasses lose approximately 833 molecules of water per co2 molecule that is fixed whereas c4 grasses lose only 277 this increased water use efficiency of c4 grasses means that soil moisture is conserved allowing them to grow for longer in arid environments 11 c4 carbon fixation has evolved on up to 61 independent occasions in 19 different families of plants making it a prime example of convergent evolution 12 this convergence may have been facilitated by the fact that many potential evolutionary pathways to a c4 phenotype exist many of which involve initial evolutionary steps not directly related to photosynthesis 13 c4 plants arose around million years ago 12 during the oligocene precisely when is difficult to determine and did not become ecologically significant until around million years ago in the miocene period 14 c4 metabolism originated when grasses migrated from the shady forest undercanopy to more open environments 15 where the high sunlight gave it an advantage over the c3 pathway 16 drought was not necessary for its innovation rather the increased resistance to water stress was a by-product of the pathway and allowed c4 plants to more readily colonise arid environments 16 today c4 plants represent about 5 of earth s plant biomass and 3 of its known plant species 11 17 despite this scarcity they account for about 23 of terrestrial carbon fixation 14 18 increasing the proportion of c4 plants on earth could assist biosequestration of co2 and represent an important climate change avoidance strategy present-day c4 plants are concentrated in the tropics and subtropics below latitudes of 45 where the high air temperature contributes to higher possible levels of oxygenase activity by rubisco which increases rates of photorespiration in c3 plants plants that use c4 carbon fixation edit maize or corn is a common c4 plant about 8,100 plant species use c4 carbon fixation which represents about 3 of all terrestrial species of plants 18 19 all these 8,100 species are angiosperms c4 carbon fixation is less common in dicots than in monocots with only 4.5 of dicots using the c4 pathway compared to 40 of monocots despite this only three families of monocots utilise c4 carbon fixation compared to 15 dicot families of the monocot clades containing c4 plants the grass poaceae species use the c4 photosynthetic pathway most forty-six percent of grasses are c4 and together account for 61 of c4 species these include the food crops maize sugar cane millet and sorghum 20 21 of the dicot clades containing c4 species the order caryophyllales contains the most species of the families in the caryophyllales the chenopodiaceae use c4 carbon fixation the most with 550 out of 1,400 species using it about 250 of the 1000 species of the related amaranthaceae also use c4 11 22 members of the sedge family cyperaceae and members of numerous families of eudicots -including asteraceae the daisy family brassicaceae the cabbage family and euphorbiaceae the spurge family - also use c4 trees which use c4 include paulownia converting c3 plants to c4 edit given the advantages of c4 a group of scientists from institutions around the world are working on the c4 rice project to turn rice a c3 plant into a c4 plant by studying the c4 plants maize and brachypodium 23 as rice is the world s most important human food it is the staple food for more than half the planet having rice that is more efficient at converting sunlight into grain could have significant global benefits towards improving food security the team claim c4 rice could produce up to 50 more grain and be able to do it with less water and nutrients 24 25 26 the researchers have already identified genes needed for c4 photosynthesis in rice and are now looking towards developing a prototype c4 rice plant in 2012 the government of the united kingdom along with the bill melinda gates foundation provided 14 million over 3 years towards the c4 rice project at the international rice research institute 27 see also edit c2 photosynthesis cam photosynthesis c3 photosynthesis references edit slack cr hatch md 1967 pdf the biochemical journal 103
