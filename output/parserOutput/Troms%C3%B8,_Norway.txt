message the city of troms is named after the island of troms ya on which it stands the last element of the city s name comes from island norwegian y danish but the etymology of the first element is uncertain several theories exist one theory holds troms- to derive from the old uncompounded name of the island old norse trums several islands and rivers in norway have the name tromsa and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means strong current the original form must then have been strums for the missing s see indo-european s-mobile another theory holds that troms ya was originally called lille troms ya little troms ya because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called kval ya that according to this theory was earlier called store troms ya due to a
