branch of applied mathematics specifically classical mechanics concerned with the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion as opposed to kinematics which studies the motion of objects without reference to its causes isaac newton defined the fundamental physical laws which govern dynamics in physics especially his second law of motion contents 1 principles 2 linear and rotational dynamics 3 force 4 newton s laws 5 see also 6 references 7 further reading principles edit generally speaking researchers involved in dynamics study how a physical system might develop or alter over time and study the causes of those changes in addition newton established the fundamental physical laws which govern dynamics in physics by studying his system of mechanics dynamics can be understood in particular dynamics is mostly related to newton s second law of motion however all three laws of motion are taken into account because these are interrelated in any given observation or experiment linear and rotational dynamics edit the study of dynamics falls under two categories linear and rotational linear dynamics pertains to objects moving in a line and involves such quantities as force mass inertia displacement in units of distance velocity distance per unit time acceleration distance per unit of time squared and momentum mass times unit of velocity rotational dynamics pertains to objects that are rotating or moving in a curved path and involves such quantities as torque moment of inertia rotational inertia angular displacement in radians or less often degrees angular velocity radians per unit time angular acceleration radians per unit of time squared and angular momentum moment of inertia times unit of angular velocity very often objects exhibit linear and rotational motion for classical electromagnetism it is maxwell s equations that describe the dynamics and the dynamics of classical systems involving both mechanics and electromagnetism are described by the combination of newton s laws maxwell s equations and the lorentz force force edit from newton force can be defined as an exertion or pressure which can cause an object to accelerate the concept of force is used to describe an influence which causes a free body object to accelerate it can be a push or a pull which causes an object to change direction have new velocity or to deform temporarily or permanently generally speaking force causes an object s state of motion to change 1 newton s laws edit newton described force as the ability to cause a mass to accelerate his three laws can be summarized as follows first law if there is no net force on an object then its velocity is constant the object is either at rest if its velocity is equal to zero or it moves with constant speed in a single direction 2 3 second law the rate of change of linear momentum p of an object is equal to the net force fnet i e dp dt fnet third law when a first body exerts a force f1 on a second body the second body simultaneously exerts a force f2 f1 on the first body this means that f1 and f2 are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction newton s laws of motion are valid only in an inertial frame
