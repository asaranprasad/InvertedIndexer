satellite it is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the solar system and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits its primary following jupiter s satellite io the moon is the second-densest satellite in the solar system among those whose densities are known the moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago not long after earth the most widely accepted explanation is that the moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between earth and a mars-sized body called theia the moon is in synchronous rotation with earth always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters as seen from the earth it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in earth s sky after the sun its surface is actually dark although compared to the night sky it appears very bright with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides body tides and the slight lengthening of the day the moon s average orbital distance at the present time is 384,402 km 238,856 mi 10 11 or 1.28 light-seconds this is about thirty times the diameter of earth with its apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the sun due to it being 400x farther and larger resulting in the moon covering the sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse this matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the far future because the moon s distance from earth is slowly increasing the soviet union s luna program was the first to reach the moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959 the united states nasa apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by apollo 8 in 1968 and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972 with the first being apollo 11 these missions returned lunar rocks which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the moon s origin internal structure and later history since the apollo 17 mission in 1972 the moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft within human culture both the moon s natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of phases as seen from the earth have provided cultural references and influences

the moon which is usually not capitalized in nonscientific texts 12 13 14 15 16 the noun moon is derived from old english m na which like all germanic language cognates stems from proto-germanic m n which comes from proto-indo-european m h n s moon month which comes from the proto-indo-european root meh - to measure the month being the ancient unit of time measured by the moon 17 18 occasionally the name luna is used in literature especially science fiction luna is used to distinguish it from other moons while in poetry the name has been used to denote personification of our moon 19 the modern english adjective pertaining to the moon is lunar derived from the latin word for the moon luna the adjective selenic usually only used to refer to selenium is so rarely used to refer to the moon that this meaning is not recorded in most major dictionaries 20 21 22 it is derived from the ancient greek word for the moon sel n from which is however also derived the prefix seleno- as in selenography the study of the physical features of the moon 23 24 both the greek goddess selene and the roman goddess diana were alternatively called cynthia 25 the names luna cynthia and selene are reflected in terminology for lunar orbits in words such as apolune pericynthion and selenocentric the name diana comes from the proto-indo-european diw-yo heavenly which comes from the pie root dyeu- to shine which in many derivatives means sky heaven and god and is also the origin of latin dies day the moon near side of the moon far side of the moon lunar north pole lunar south pole formation several mechanisms have been proposed for the moon s formation 4.51 billion years ago f and some 60 million years after the origin of the solar system 26 these mechanisms included the fission of the moon from earth s crust through centrifugal force 27 which would require too great an initial spin of earth 28 the gravitational capture of a pre-formed moon 29 which would require an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of earth to dissipate the energy of the passing moon 28 and the co-formation of earth and the moon together in the primordial accretion disk which does not explain the depletion of metals in the moon 28 these hypotheses also cannot account for the high angular momentum of the earth moon system 30 play media the evolution of the moon and a tour of the moon the prevailing hypothesis is that the earth moon system formed as a result of the impact of a mars-sized body named theia with the proto-earth giant impact that blasted material into orbit about the earth that then accreted to form the present earth-moon system 31 32 the far side of the moon has a crust that is 30 mi 48 km thicker than the near side of the moon this is thought to be due to the moon having been amalgamated from two different bodies this hypothesis although not perfect perhaps best explains the evidence eighteen months prior to an october 1984 conference on lunar origins bill hartmann roger phillips and jeff taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists you have eighteen months go back to your apollo data go back to your computer do whatever you have to but make up your mind don t come to our conference unless you have something to say about the moon s birth at the 1984 conference at kona hawaii the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular before the conference there were partisans of the three traditional theories plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn t think the debate would ever be resolved afterward there were essentially only two groups the giant impact camp and the agnostics 33 giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early solar system computer simulations of a giant impact have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the earth moon system these simulations also show that most of the moon derived from the impactor rather than the proto-earth 34 more recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the moon derived from the original earth mass 35 36 37 38 studies of meteorites originating from inner solar system bodies such as mars and vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to earth whereas earth and the moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions the isotopic equalization of the earth-moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two 39 although this is debated 40 the great amount of energy released in the impact event and the subsequent re-accretion of that material into the earth-moon system would have melted the outer shell of earth forming a magma ocean 41 42 similarly the newly formed moon would also have been affected and had its own lunar magma ocean estimates for its depth range from about 500 km 300 miles to its entire depth 1,737 km 1,079 miles 41 while the giant impact hypothesis might explain many lines of evidence there are still some unresolved questions most of which involve the moon s composition 43 oceanus procellarum ocean of storms ancient rift valleys rectangular structure visible topography grail gravity gradients ancient rift valleys context ancient rift valleys closeup artist s concept in 2001 a team at the carnegie institute of washington reported the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks 44 to their surprise the team found that the rocks from the apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from earth and were different from almost all other bodies in the solar system because most of the material that went into orbit to form the moon was thought to come from theia this observation was unexpected in 2007 researchers from the california institute of technology announced that there was less than a 1 chance that theia and earth had identical isotopic signatures 45 published in 2012 an analysis of titanium isotopes in apollo lunar samples showed that the moon has the same composition as earth 46 which conflicts with what is expected if the moon formed far from earth s orbit or from theia variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data physical characteristics internal structure structure of the moon

core the moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 km 150 mi and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 km 190 mi around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 km 310 mi 48 49 this structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the moon s formation 4.5 billion years ago 50 crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop 51 the final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements 1 consistent with this perspective geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests the crust of mostly anorthosite 9 the moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition which is more iron-rich than that of earth 1 the crust is on average about 50 km 31 mi thick 1 the moon is the second-densest satellite in the solar system after io 52 however the inner core of the moon is small with a radius of about 350 km 220 mi or less 1 around 20 of the radius of the moon its composition is not well defined but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel analyses of the moon s time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten 53 surface geology topography of the moon the topography of the moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis 54 its most visible topographic feature is the giant far-side south pole aitken basin some 2,240 km 1,390 mi in diameter the largest crater on the moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the solar system 55 56 at 13 km 8.1 mi deep its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the moon 55 57 the highest elevations of the moon s surface are located directly to the northeast and it has been suggested might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the south pole aitken basin 58 other large impact basins such as imbrium serenitatis crisium smythii and orientale also possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims 55 the far side of the lunar surface is on average about 1.9 km 1.2 mi higher than that of the near side 1 the discovery of fault scarp cliffs by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter suggest that the moon has shrunk within the past billion years by about 90 metres 300 ft 59 similar shrinkage features exist on mercury volcanic features lunar nearside with major maria and craters labeled the dark and relatively featureless lunar plains clearly seen with the naked eye are called maria latin for seas singular mare as they were once believed to be filled with water 60 they are now known to be vast solidified pools of ancient basaltic lava although similar to terrestrial basalts lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water 61 the majority of these lavas erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side maria 62 evidence of young lunar volcanism almost all maria are on the near side of the moon and cover 31 of the surface of the near side 63 compared with 2 of the far side 64 this is thought to be due to a concentration of heat-producing elements under the crust on the near side seen on geochemical maps obtained by lunar prospector s gamma-ray spectrometer which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up partially melt rise to the surface and erupt 51 65 66 most of the moon s mare basalts erupted during the imbrian period 3.0 3.5 billion years ago although some radiometrically dated samples are as old as 4.2 billion years 67 until recently the youngest eruptions dated by crater counting appeared to have been only 1.2 billion years ago 68 in 2006 a study of ina a tiny depression in lacus felicitatis found jagged relatively dust-free features that due to the lack of erosion by infalling debris appeared to be only 2 million years old 69 moonquakes and releases of gas also indicate some continued lunar activity 69 in 2014 nasa announced widespread evidence of young lunar volcanism at 70 irregular mare patches identified by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter some less than 50 million years old this raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer due to the greater concentration of radioactive elements 70 71 72 73 just prior to this evidence has been presented for 2 10 million years younger basaltic volcanism inside lowell crater 74 75 orientale basin located in the transition zone between the near and far sides of the moon an initially hotter mantle and or local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities also on the far side in the orientale basin 76 77 the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called terrae or more commonly highlands because they are higher than most maria they have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean 67 68 in contrast to earth no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events 78 the concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the far side which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of earth a few tens of millions of years after their formation 79 80 impact craters lunar crater daedalus on the moon s far side the other major geologic process that has affected the moon s surface is impact cratering 81 with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface there are estimated to be roughly 300,000 craters wider than 1 km 0.6 mi on the moon s near side alone 82 the lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events including nectaris imbrium and orientale structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted material between hundreds and thousands of kilometres in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon 83 the lack of an atmosphere weather and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated they are useful for assigning relative ages because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface 83 the radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the apollo missions cluster between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years old this has been used to propose a late heavy bombardment of impacts 84 blanketed on top of the moon s crust is a highly comminuted broken into ever smaller particles and impact gardened surface layer called regolith formed by impact processes the finer regolith the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass has a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder 85 the regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces it varies in thickness from 10 20 km 6.2 12.4 mi in the highlands and 3 5 km 1.9 3.1 mi in the maria 86 beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the megaregolith a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometres thick 87 comparison of high-resolution images obtained by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter has shown a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than previously estimated a secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimetres of regolith a hundred times more quickly than previous models suggested on a timescale of 81,000 years 88 89 lunar swirls at reiner gamma lunar swirls lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the moon s surface which are characterized by a high albedo appearing optically immature i e the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith and often displaying a sinuous shape their curvilinear shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls presence of water liquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface when exposed to solar radiation water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space however since the 1960s scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks and hydrogen from solar wind leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the moon 90 91 computer simulations suggest that up to 14,000 km2 5,400 sq mi of the surface may be in permanent shadow 92 the presence of usable quantities of water on the moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan the alternative of transporting water from earth would be prohibitively expensive 93 in years since signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface 94 in 1994 the bistatic radar experiment located on the clementine spacecraft indicated the existence of small frozen pockets of water close to the surface however later radar observations by arecibo suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters 95 in 1998 the neutron spectrometer on the lunar prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions 96 volcanic lava beads brought back to earth aboard apollo 15 showed small amounts of water in their interior 97 the 2008 chandrayaan-1 spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice using the on-board moon mineralogy mapper the spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl in reflected sunlight providing evidence of large quantities of water ice on the lunar surface the spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1,000 ppm 98 in 2009 lcross sent a 2,300 kg 5,100 lb impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater and detected at least 100 kg 220 lb of water in a plume of ejected material 99 100 another examination of the lcross data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to 155 12 kg 342 26 lb 101 in may 2011 615 1410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample 74220 was reported 102 the famous high-titanium orange glass soil of volcanic origin collected during the apollo 17 mission in 1972 the inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago this concentration is comparable with that of magma in earth s upper mantle although of considerable selenological interest this announcement affords little comfort to would-be lunar colonists the sample originated many kilometers below the surface and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument gravitational field grail s gravity map of the moon the gravitational field of the moon has been measured through tracking the doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft the main lunar gravity features are mascons large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins 103 104 the anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the moon there are some puzzles lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism 105 magnetic field the moon has an external magnetic field of about 1 100 nanoteslas less than one-hundredth that of earth it does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization probably acquired early in lunar history when a dynamo was still operating 106 107 alternatively some of the remnant magnetization may be from transient magnetic fields generated during large impact events through the expansion of an impact-generated plasma cloud in the presence of an ambient magnetic field this is supported by the apparent location of the largest crustal magnetizations near the antipodes of the giant impact basins 108 atmosphere sketch by the apollo 17 astronauts the lunar atmosphere was later studied by ladee 109 110 the moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum with a total mass of less than 10 metric tons 9.8 long tons 11 short tons 111 the surface pressure of this small mass is around 3 10 15 atm 0.3 npa it varies with the lunar day its sources include outgassing and sputtering a product of the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions 9 112 elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium produced by sputtering also found in the atmospheres of mercury and io helium-4 and neon 113 from the solar wind and argon-40 radon-222 and polonium-210 outgassed after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle 114 115 the absence of such neutral species atoms or molecules as oxygen nitrogen carbon hydrogen and magnesium which are present in the regolith is not understood 114 water vapour has been detected by chandrayaan-1 and found to vary with latitude with a maximum at 60 70 degrees it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith 116 these gases either return into the regolith due to the moon s gravity or are lost to space either through solar radiation pressure or if they are ionized by being swept away by the solar wind s magnetic field 114 dust a permanent asymmetric moon dust cloud exists around the moon created by small particles from comets estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the moon s surface each 24 hours the particles strike the moon s surface ejecting moon dust above the moon the dust stays above the moon approximately 10 minutes taking 5 minutes to rise and 5 minutes to fall on average 120 kilograms of dust are present above the moon rising to 100 kilometers above the surface the dust measurements were made by ladee s lunar dust experiment ldex between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface during a six-month period ldex detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute dust particle counts peaked during the geminid quadrantid northern taurid and omicron centaurid meteor showers when the earth and moon pass through comet debris the cloud is asymmetric more dense near the boundary between the moon s dayside and nightside 117 118 past thicker atmosphere in october 2017 nasa scientists at the marshall space flight center and the lunar and planetary institute in houston announced their finding based on studies of moon magma samples retrieved by the apollo missions that the moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago this atmosphere sourced from gases ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions was twice the thickness of that of present-day mars the ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space 119 seasons the moon s axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only 1.5424 120 much less than the 23.44 of earth because of this the moon s solar illumination varies much less with season and topographical details play a crucial role in seasonal effects 121 from images taken by clementine in 1994 it appears that four mountainous regions on the rim of peary crater at the moon s north pole may remain illuminated for the entire lunar day creating peaks of eternal light no such regions exist at the south pole similarly there are places that remain in permanent shadow at the bottoms of many polar craters 92 and these craters of eternal darkness are extremely cold lunar reconnaissance orbiter measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at 35 k 238 c 397 f 122 and just 26 k 247 c 413 f close to the winter solstice in north polar hermite crater this is the coldest temperature in the solar system ever measured by a spacecraft colder even than the surface of pluto 121 average temperatures of the moon s surface are reported but temperatures of different areas will vary greatly depending upon whether they are in sunlight or shadow 123 relationship to earth orbit earth moon system schematic dscovr satellite sees the moon passing in front of earth the moon makes a complete orbit around earth with respect to the fixed stars about once every 27.3 days g its sidereal period however because earth is moving in its orbit around the sun at the same time it takes slightly longer for the moon to show the same phase to earth which is about 29.5 days h its synodic period 63 unlike most satellites of other planets the moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet s equatorial plane the moon s orbit is subtly perturbed by the sun and earth in many small complex and interacting ways for example the plane of the moon s orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 124 years which affects other aspects of lunar motion these follow-on effects are mathematically described by cassini s laws 125 relative size the moon is exceptionally large relative to earth a quarter its diameter and 1 81 its mass 63 it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet i though charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto at 1 9 pluto s mass j 126 the earth and the moon s barycentre their common centre of mass is located 1,700 km 1,100 mi about a quarter of earth s radius beneath earth s surface the earth revolves around the earth-moon barycentre once a sidereal month moving at 1 81 the speed of the moon or about 12.5 metres 41 ft per second this motion is superimposed on the much larger revolution of the earth around the sun at a speed of about 30 kilometres 19 mi per second appearance from earth moon setting in western sky over the high desert in california moon above makarska croatia the moon is in synchronous rotation as it orbits earth it rotates about its axis in about the same time it takes to orbit earth this results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards earth however due to the effect of libration about 59 of the moon s surface can actually be seen from earth the side of the moon that faces earth is called the near side and the opposite the far side the far side is often inaccurately called the dark side but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side once every 29.5 earth days during new moon the near side is dark 127 the moon had once rotated at a faster rate but early in its history its rotation slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by earth 128 with time the energy of rotation of the moon on its axis was dissipated as heat until there was no rotation of the moon relative to earth in 2016 planetary scientists using data collected on the much earlier nasa lunar prospector mission found two hydrogen-rich areas on opposite sides of the moon probably in the form of water ice it is speculated that these patches were the poles of the moon billions of years ago before it was tidally locked to earth 129 the moon has an exceptionally low albedo giving it a reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt despite this it is the brightest object in the sky after the sun 63 k this is partly due to the brightness enhancement of the opposition surge the moon at quarter phase is only one-tenth as bright rather than half as bright as at full moon 130 additionally color constancy in the visual system recalibrates the relations between the colors of an object and its surroundings and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark the sunlit moon is perceived as a bright object the edges of the full moon seem as bright as the centre without limb darkening due to the reflective properties of lunar soil which retroreflects light more towards the sun than in other directions the moon does appear larger when close to the horizon but this is a purely psychological effect known as the moon illusion first described in the 7th century bc 131 the full moon s angular diameter is about 0.52 on average in the sky roughly the same apparent size as the sun see eclipses the moon s highest altitude at culmination varies by its phase and time of year the full moon is currently northernmost during winter the 18.61-year nodal cycle has an influence on lunar standstill when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox the lunar declination can reach up to plus or minus 28 each month this means the moon can pass overhead if viewed from latitudes up to 28 north or south of the equator instead of only 18 the orientation of the moon s crescent also depends on the latitude of the viewing location an observer in the tropics can see a smile-shaped crescent moon 132 the moon is visible for two weeks every 27.3 days at the north and south poles zooplankton in the arctic use moonlight when the sun is below the horizon for months on end 133 14 november 2016 supermoon was 356,511 kilometres 221,526 mi away 134 from the center of earth the closest occurrence since 26 january 1948 it will not be closer until 25 november 2034 135 the distance between the moon and earth varies from around 356,400 km 221,500 mi to 406,700 km 252,700 mi at perigee closest and apogee farthest respectively on 14 november 2016 it was closer to earth when at full phase than it has been since 1948 14 closer than its farthest position in apogee 136 reported as a supermoon this closest point coincides within an hour of a full moon and it was 30 more luminous than when at its greatest distance due to its angular diameter being 14 greater because 1.14 2 1.30

1.00 1.14 this gives a maximum perceived increase of 14 between apogee and perigee moons of the same phase 142 there has been historical controversy over whether features on the moon s surface change over time today many of these claims are thought to be illusory resulting from observation under different lighting conditions poor astronomical seeing or inadequate drawings however outgassing does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena recently it has been suggested that a roughly 3 km 1.9 mi diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago 143 144 the moon s appearance like the sun s can be affected by earth s atmosphere common optical effects are the 22 halo ring formed when the moon s light is refracted through the ice crystals of high cirrostratus clouds and smaller coronal rings when the moon is seen through thin clouds 145 the monthly changes in the angle between the direction of sunlight and view from earth and the phases of the moon that result as viewed from the northern hemisphere the earth moon distance is not to scale the illuminated area of the visible sphere degree of illumination is given by 1 cos e 2 sin 2 e 2 displaystyle 1- cos e 2 sin 2 e 2 where e displaystyle e is the elongation i e the angle between moon the observer on earth and the sun tidal effects the libration of the moon over a single lunar month also visible is the slight variation in the moon s visual size from earth the gravitational attraction that masses have for one another decreases inversely with the square of the distance of those masses from each other as a result the slightly greater attraction that the moon has for the side of earth closest to the moon as compared to the part of the earth opposite the moon results in tidal forces tidal forces affect both the earth s crust and oceans the most obvious effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the earth s oceans one on the side facing the moon and the other on the side opposite this results in elevated sea levels called ocean tides 146 as the earth spins on its axis one of the ocean bulges high tide is held in place under the moon while another such tide is opposite as a result there are two high tides and two low tides in about 24 hours 146 since the moon is orbiting the earth in the same direction of the earth s rotation the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes the 25 minutes is due to the moon s time to orbit the earth the sun has the same tidal effect on the earth but its forces of attraction are only 40 that of the moon s the sun s and moon s interplay is responsible for spring and neap tides 146 if the earth were a water world one with no continents it would produce a tide of only one meter and that tide would be very predictable but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects the frictional coupling of water to earth s rotation through the ocean floors the inertia of water s movement ocean basins that grow shallower near land the sloshing of water between different ocean basins 147 as a result the timing of the tides at most points on the earth is a product of observations that are explained incidentally by theory while gravitation causes acceleration and movement of the earth s fluid oceans gravitational coupling between the moon and earth s solid body is mostly elastic and plastic the result is a further tidal effect of the moon on the earth that causes a bulge of the solid portion of the earth nearest the moon that acts as a torque in opposition to the earth s rotation this drains angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from earth s spin slowing the earth s rotation 146 148 that angular momentum lost from the earth is transferred to the moon in a process confusingly known as tidal acceleration which lifts the moon into a higher orbit and results in its lower orbital speed about the earth thus the distance between earth and moon is increasing and the earth s spin is slowing in reaction 148 measurements from laser reflectors left during the apollo missions lunar ranging experiments have found that the moon s distance increases by 38 mm 1.5 in per year 149 roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow 150 atomic clocks also show that earth s day lengthens by about 15 microseconds every year 151 slowly increasing the rate at which utc is adjusted by leap seconds left to run its course this tidal drag would continue until the spin of earth and the orbital period of the moon matched creating mutual tidal locking between the two as a result the moon would be suspended in the sky over one meridian as is already currently the case with pluto and its moon charon however the sun will become a red giant engulfing the earth-moon system long before this occurrence 152 153 in a like manner the lunar surface experiences tides of around 10 cm 4 in amplitude over 27 days with two components a fixed one due to earth because they are in synchronous rotation and a varying component from the sun 148 the earth-induced component arises from libration a result of the moon s orbital eccentricity if the moon s orbit were perfectly circular there would only be solar tides 148 libration also changes the angle from which the moon is seen allowing a total of about 59 of its surface to be seen from earth over time 63 the cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes although moon quakes can last for up to an hour a significantly longer time than terrestrial quakes because of the absence of water to damp out the seismic vibrations the existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the moon by apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972 154 eclipses from earth the moon and the sun appear the same size as seen in the 1999 solar eclipse left whereas from the stereo-b spacecraft in an earth-trailing orbit the moon appears much smaller than the sun right 155 eclipses can only occur when the sun earth and moon are all in a straight line termed syzygy solar eclipses occur at new moon when the moon is between the sun and earth in contrast lunar eclipses occur at full moon when earth is between the sun and moon the apparent size of the moon is roughly the same as that of the sun with both being viewed at close to one-half a degree wide the sun is much larger than the moon but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller moon from the perspective of earth the variations in apparent size due to the non-circular orbits are nearly the same as well though occurring in different cycles this makes possible both total with the moon appearing larger than the sun and annular with the moon appearing smaller than the sun solar eclipses 156 in a total eclipse the moon completely covers the disc of the sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye because the distance between the moon and earth is very slowly increasing over time 146 the angular diameter of the moon is decreasing also as it evolves toward becoming a red giant the size of the sun and its apparent diameter in the sky are slowly increasing l the combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago the moon would always completely cover the sun on solar eclipses and no annular eclipses were possible likewise hundreds of millions of years in the future the moon will no longer cover the sun completely and total solar eclipses will not occur 157 because the moon s orbit around earth is inclined by about 5.145 5 9 to the orbit of earth around the sun eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon for an eclipse to occur the moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes 158 the periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the sun by the moon and of the moon by earth is described by the saros which has a period of approximately 18 years 159 because the moon is continuously blocking our view of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky m 160 the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the moon and is occulted hidden from view in this way a solar eclipse is an occultation of the sun because the moon is comparatively close to earth occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet nor at the same time because of the precession of the lunar orbit each year different stars are occulted 161 observation and exploration ancient and medieval studies map of the moon by johannes hevelius from his selenographia 1647 the first map to include the libration zones a study of the moon in robert hooke s micrographia 1665 understanding of the moon s cycles was an early development of astronomy by the 5th century bc babylonian astronomers had recorded the 18-year saros cycle of lunar eclipses 162 and indian astronomers had described the moon s monthly elongation 163 the chinese astronomer shi shen fl 4th century bc gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses 164 later the physical form of the moon and the cause of moonlight became understood the ancient greek philosopher anaxagoras d 428 bc reasoned that the sun and moon were both giant spherical rocks and that the latter reflected the light of the former 165 166 although the chinese of the han dynasty believed the moon to be energy equated to qi their radiating influence theory also recognized that the light of the moon was merely a reflection of the sun and jing fang 78 37 bc noted the sphericity of the moon 167 in the 2nd century ad lucian wrote the novel a true story in which the heroes travel to the moon and meet its inhabitants in 499 ad the indian astronomer aryabhata mentioned in his aryabhatiya that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the moon 168 the astronomer and physicist alhazen 965 1039 found that sunlight was not reflected from the moon like a mirror but that light was emitted from every part of the moon s sunlit surface in all directions 169 shen kuo 1031 1095 of the song dynasty created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the moon to a round ball of reflective silver that when doused with white powder and viewed from the side would appear to be a crescent 170 galileo s sketches of the moon from sidereus nuncius in aristotle s 384 322 bc description of the universe the moon marked the boundary between the spheres of the mutable elements earth water air and fire and the imperishable stars of aether an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries 171 however in the 2nd century bc seleucus of seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the moon and that their height depends on the moon s position relative to the sun 172 in the same century aristarchus computed the size and distance of the moon from earth obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of earth for the distance these figures were greatly improved by ptolemy 90 168 ad his values of a mean distance of 59 times earth s radius and a diameter of 0.292 earth diameters were close to the correct values of about 60 and 0.273 respectively 173 archimedes 287 212 bc designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the moon and other objects in the solar system 174 during the middle ages before the invention of the telescope the moon was increasingly recognised as a sphere though many believed that it was perfectly smooth 175 in 1609 galileo galilei drew one of the first telescopic drawings of the moon in his book sidereus nuncius and noted that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters telescopic mapping of the moon followed later in the 17th century the efforts of giovanni battista riccioli and francesco maria grimaldi led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today the more exact 1834 36 mappa selenographica of wilhelm beer and johann heinrich m dler and their associated 1837 book der mond the first trigonometrically accurate study of lunar features included the heights of more than a thousand mountains and introduced the study of the moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography 176 lunar craters first noted by galileo were thought to be volcanic until the 1870s proposal of richard proctor that they were formed by collisions 63 this view gained support in 1892 from the experimentation of geologist grove karl gilbert and from comparative studies from 1920 to the 1940s 177 leading to the development of lunar stratigraphy which by the 1950s was becoming a new and growing branch of astrogeology 63 by spacecraft 20th century soviet missions luna 2 the first human-made object to reach the surface of the moon left and soviet moon rover lunokhod 1 the cold war-inspired space race between the soviet union and the u s led to an acceleration of interest in exploration of the moon once launchers had the necessary capabilities these nations sent unmanned probes on both flyby and impact lander missions spacecraft from the soviet union s luna program were the first to accomplish a number of goals following three unnamed failed missions in 1958 178 the first human-made object to escape earth s gravity and pass near the moon was luna 1 the first human-made object to impact the lunar surface was luna 2 and the first photographs of the normally occluded far side of the moon were made by luna 3 all in 1959 the first spacecraft to perform a successful lunar soft landing was luna 9 and the first unmanned vehicle to orbit the moon was luna 10 both in 1966 63 rock and soil samples were brought back to earth by three luna sample return missions luna 16 in 1970 luna 20 in 1972 and luna 24 in 1976 which returned 0.3 kg total 179 two pioneering robotic rovers landed on the moon in 1970 and 1973 as a part of soviet lunokhod programme luna 24 was the last soviet russian mission to the moon united states missions earthrise apollo 8 1968 moon rock apollo 17 1972 during the late 1950s at the height of the cold war the united states army conducted a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the moon called project horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear earth bombardment the study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test 180 181 the air force which at the time was in competition with the army for a leading role in the space program developed its own similar plan called lunex 182 183 180 however both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency nasa 183 following president john f kennedy s 1961 commitment to a manned moon landing before the end of the decade the united states under nasa leadership launched a series of unmanned probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for manned missions the jet propulsion laboratory s ranger program produced the first close-up pictures the lunar orbiter program produced maps of the entire moon the surveyor program landed its first spacecraft four months after luna 9 the manned apollo program was developed in parallel after a series of unmanned and manned tests of the apollo spacecraft in earth orbit and spurred on by a potential soviet lunar flight in 1968 apollo 8 made the first manned mission to lunar orbit the subsequent landing of the first humans on the moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the space race 184 neil armstrong working at the lunar module that s one small step problems playing this file see media help neil armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon as the commander of the american mission apollo 11 by first setting foot on the moon at 02 56 utc on 21 july 1969 185 an estimated 500

aborted its planned lunar landing returned 380.05 kilograms 837.87 lb of lunar rock and soil in 2,196 separate samples 188 the american moon landing and return was enabled by considerable technological advances in the early 1960s in domains such as ablation chemistry software engineering and atmospheric re-entry technology and by highly competent management of the enormous technical undertaking 189 190 scientific instrument packages were installed on the lunar surface during all the apollo landings long-lived instrument stations including heat flow probes seismometers and magnetometers were installed at the apollo 12 14 15 16 and 17 landing sites direct transmission of data to earth concluded in late 1977 due to budgetary considerations 191 192 but as the stations lunar laser ranging corner-cube retroreflector arrays are passive instruments they are still being used ranging to the stations is routinely performed from earth-based stations with an accuracy of a few centimetres and data from this experiment are being used to place constraints on the size of the lunar core 193 1980s 2000 an artificially coloured mosaic constructed from a series of 53 images taken through three spectral filters by galileo s imaging system as the spacecraft flew over the northern regions of the moon on 7 december 1992 after the first moon race there were years of near quietude but starting in the 1990s many more countries have become involved in direct exploration of the moon in 1990 japan became the third country to place a spacecraft into lunar orbit with its hiten spacecraft the spacecraft released a smaller probe hagoromo in lunar orbit but the transmitter failed preventing further scientific use of the mission 194 in 1994 the u s sent the joint defense department nasa spacecraft clementine to lunar orbit this mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the moon and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface 195 this was followed in 1998 by the lunar prospector mission whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles which is likely to have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters 196 india japan china the united states and the european space agency each sent lunar orbiters and especially isro s chandrayaan-1 has contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith the post-apollo era has also seen two rover missions the

thus far companies operation had been restricted to being on or around earth 221 astronomy from the moon a false-color image of earth in ultraviolet light taken from the surface of the moon on the apollo 16 mission the day-side reflects a lot of uv light from the sun but the night-side shows faint bands of uv emission from the aurora caused by charged particles 222 for many years the moon has been recognized as an excellent site for telescopes 223 it is relatively nearby astronomical seeing is not a concern certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes and radio telescopes on the far side would be shielded from the radio chatter of earth 224 the lunar soil although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter 225 a lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid 226 in april 1972 the apollo 16 mission recorded various astronomical photos and spectra in ultraviolet with the far ultraviolet camera spectrograph 227 legal status although luna landers scattered pennants of the soviet union on the moon and u s flags were symbolically planted at their landing sites by the apollo astronauts no nation claims ownership of any part of the moon s surface 228 russia and the u s are party to the 1967 outer space treaty 229 which defines the moon and all outer space as the province of all mankind 228 this treaty also restricts the use of the moon to peaceful purposes explicitly banning military installations and weapons of mass destruction 230 the 1979 moon agreement was created to restrict the exploitation of the moon s resources by any single nation but as of november 2016 it has been signed and ratified by only 18 nations none of which engages in self-launched human space exploration or has plans to do so 231 although several individuals have made claims to the moon in whole or in part none of these are considered credible 232 233 234 in culture luna the moon from a 1550 edition of guido bonatti s liber astronomiae mythology sun and moon with faces 1493 woodcut a 5,000-year-old rock carving at knowth ireland may represent the moon which would be the earliest depiction discovered 235 the contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the man in the moon the rabbit and the buffalo among others in many prehistoric and ancient cultures the moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon and astrological views of the moon continue to be propagated today in proto-indo-european religion the moon was personified as the male god meh1not 236 the ancient sumerians believed that the moon was the god nanna 237 238 who was the father of inanna the goddess of the planet venus 237 238 and utu the god of the sun 237 238 nanna was later known as s n 238 237 and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery 237 in greco-roman mythology the sun and the moon are represented as male and female respectively helios sol and selene luna 236 this is a development unique to the eastern mediterranean 236 and traces of an earlier male moon god in the greek tradition are preserved in the figure of menelaus 236 in mesopotamian iconography the crescent was the primary symbol of nanna-s n 238 in ancient greek art the moon goddess selene was represented wearing a crescent on her headgear in an arrangement reminiscent of horns 239 240 the star and crescent arrangement also goes back to the bronze age representing either the sun and moon or the moon and planet venus in combination it came to represent the goddess artemis or hecate and via the patronage of hecate came to be used as a symbol of byzantium an iconographic tradition of representing sun and moon with faces developed in the late medieval period the splitting of the moon arabic is a miracle attributed to muhammad 241 calendar the moon s regular phases make it a very convenient timepiece and the periods of its waxing and waning form the basis of many of the oldest calendars tally sticks notched bones dating as far back as 20 30,000 years ago are believed by some to mark the phases of the moon 242 243 244 the 30-day month is an approximation of the lunar cycle the english noun month and its

visual sighting of the hilal or earliest crescent moon over the horizon 253 moonrise 1884 picture by stanis aw mas owski national museum krak w gallery of sukiennice museum lunacy the moon has long been associated with insanity and irrationality the words lunacy and lunatic popular shortening loony are derived from the latin name for the moon luna philosophers aristotle and pliny the elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals believing that the brain which is mostly water must be affected by the moon and its power over the tides but the moon s gravity is too slight to affect any single person 254 even today people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals traffic accidents homicides or suicides increase during a full
