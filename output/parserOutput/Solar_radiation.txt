over a year at the top of earth s atmosphere toa and at the planet s surface solar irradiance is the power per unit area received from the sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range of the measuring instrument the solar irradiance integrated over time is called solar irradiation insolation or solar exposure however insolation is often used interchangeably with irradiance in practice irradiance may be measured in space or at the earth s surface after atmospheric absorption and scattering irradiance in space is a function of distance from the sun the solar cycle and cross-cycle changes 1 irradiance on the earth s surface depends on the tilt of the measuring surface the height of the sun above the horizon and atmospheric conditions 2 solar irradiance

total solar irradiance tsi is a measure of the solar power over all wavelengths per unit area incident on the earth s upper atmosphere it is measured perpendicular to the incoming sunlight 2 the solar constant is a conventional measure of mean tsi at a distance of one astronomical unit au direct normal irradiance dni or beam radiation is measured at the surface of the earth at a given location with a surface element perpendicular to the sun 4 it excludes diffuse solar radiation radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components direct irradiance is equal to the extraterrestrial irradiance above the atmosphere minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering losses depend on time of day length of light s path through the atmosphere depending on the solar elevation angle cloud cover moisture content and other contents the irradiance above the atmosphere also varies with time of year because the distance to the sun varies although this effect is generally less significant compared to the effect of losses on dni diffuse horizontal irradiance dhi or diffuse sky radiation is the radiation at the earth s surface from light scattered by the atmosphere it is measured on a horizontal surface with radiation coming from all points in the sky excluding circumsolar radiation radiation coming from the sun disk 4 5 there would be almost no dhi in the absence of atmosphere 4 global horizontal irradiance ghi is the total irradiance from the sun on a horizontal surface on earth it is the sum of direct irradiance after accounting for the solar

total solar irradiance tsi 12 changes slowly on decadal and longer timescales the variation during solar cycle 21 was about 0.1 peak-to-peak 13 in contrast to older reconstructions 14 most recent tsi reconstructions point to an increase of only about 0.05 to 0.1 between the maunder minimum and the present 15 16 17 ultraviolet irradiance edit ultraviolet irradiance euv varies by approximately 1.5 percent from solar maxima to minima for 200 to 300 nm wavelengths 18 however a proxy study estimated that uv has increased by 3.0 since the maunder minimum 19 milankovitch cycles edit some variations in insolation are not due to solar changes but rather due to the earth moving between its perigee and apogee or changes in the latitudinal distribution of radiation these orbital changes or milankovitch cycles have caused radiance variations of as much as 25 locally global average changes are much smaller over long periods the most recent significant event was an axial tilt of 24 during

displaystyle e sin varpi the precession index whose variation dominates the variations in insolation at 65 n when eccentricity is large for the next 100,000 years with variations in eccentricity being relatively small variations in obliquity dominate measurement edit the space-based tsi record comprises measurements from more than ten radiometers spanning three solar cycles technique edit all modern tsi satellite instruments employ active cavity electrical substitution radiometry this technique applies measured electrical heating to maintain an absorptive blackened cavity in thermal equilibrium while incident sunlight passes through a precision aperture of calibrated area the aperture is modulated via a shutter accuracy uncertainties of 0.01 are required to detect long term solar irradiance variations because expected changes are in the range 0.05 to 0.15 w m2 per century 20 intertemporal calibration edit in orbit radiometric calibrations drift for reasons including solar degradation of the cavity electronic degradation of the heater surface degradation of the precision aperture and varying surface emissions and temperatures that alter thermal backgrounds these calibrations require compensation to preserve consistent measurements 20 for various reasons the sources do not always agree the solar radiation and climate experiment total irradiance measurement sorce tim tsi values are lower than prior measurements by the earth radiometer budget experiment erbe on the earth radiation budget satellite erbs virgo on the solar heliospheric observatory soho and the acrim instruments on the solar maximum mission smm upper atmosphere research satellite uars and acrimsat pre-launch ground calibrations relied on component rather than system level measurements since irradiance standards lacked absolute accuracies 20 measurement stability involves exposing different radiometer cavities to different accumulations of solar radiation to quantify exposure-dependent degradation effects these effects are then compensated for in final data observation overlaps permits corrections for both absolute offsets and validation of instrumental drifts 20 uncertainties of individual observations exceed irradiance variability 0.1 thus instrument stability and measurement continuity are relied upon to compute real variations long-term radiometer drifts can be mistaken for irradiance variations that can be misinterpreted as affecting climate examples include the issue of the irradiance increase between cycle minima in 1986 and 1996 evident only in the acrim composite and not the model and the low irradiance levels in the pmod composite during the 2008 minimum despite the fact that acrim i acrim ii acrim iii virgo and tim all track degradation with redundant cavities notable and unexplained differences remain in irradiance and the modeled influences of sunspots and faculae persistent inconsistencies edit disagreement among overlapping observations indicates unresolved drifts that suggest the tsi record is not sufficiently stable to discern solar changes on decadal time scales only the acrim composite shows irradiance increasing by 1 w m2 between 1986 and 1996 this change is also absent in the model 20 recommendations to resolve the instrument discrepancies include validating optical measurement accuracy by comparing ground-based instruments to laboratory references such as those at national institute of science and technology nist nist validation of aperture area calibrations uses spares from each instrument and applying diffraction corrections from the view-limiting aperture 20 for acrim nist determined that diffraction from the view-limiting aperture contributes a 0.13 signal not accounted for in the three acrim instruments this correction lowers the reported acrim values bringing acrim closer to tim in acrim and all other instruments the aperture is deep inside the instrument with a larger view-limiting aperture at the front depending on edge imperfections this can directly scatter light into the cavity this design admits two to three times the amount of light intended to be measured if not completely absorbed or scattered this additional light produces erroneously high signals in contrast tim s design places the precision aperture at the front so that only desired light enters 20 variations from other sources likely include an annual cycle that is nearly in phase with the sun-earth distance in acrim iii data and 90-day spikes in the virgo data coincident with soho spacecraft maneuvers that were most apparent during the 2008 solar minimum tsi radiometer facility edit tim s high absolute accuracy creates new opportunities for measuring climate variables tsi radiometer facility trf is a cryogenic radiometer that operates in a vacuum with controlled light sources l-1 standards and technology lasp designed and built the system completed in 2008 it was calibrated for optical power against the nist primary optical watt radiometer a cryogenic radiometer that maintains the nist radiant power scale to an uncertainty of 0.02 1 as of 2011 trf was the only facility that approached the desired 0.01 uncertainty for pre-launch validation of solar radiometers measuring irradiance rather than merely optical power at solar power levels and under vacuum conditions 20 trf encloses both the reference radiometer and the instrument under test in a common vacuum system that contains a stationary spatially uniform illuminating beam a precision aperture with area calibrated to 0.0031 1 determines the beam s measured portion the test instrument s precision aperture is positioned in the same location without optically altering the beam for direct comparison to the reference variable beam power provides linearity diagnostics and variable beam diameter diagnoses scattering from different instrument components 20 the glory tim and picard premos flight instrument absolute scales are now traceable to the trf in both optical power and irradiance the resulting high accuracy reduces the consequences of any future gap in the solar irradiance record 20 difference

earlier accepted value of 1365.4 1.3 w m2 established in the 1990s the new value came from sorce tim and radiometric laboratory tests scattered light is a primary cause of the higher irradiance values measured by earlier satellites in which the precision aperture is located behind a larger view-limiting aperture the tim uses a view-limiting aperture that is smaller than precision aperture that precludes this spurious signal the new estimate is from better measurement rather than a change in solar output 20 a regression model-based split of the relative proportion of sunspot and facular influences from sorce tim data accounts for 92 of observed variance and tracks the observed trends to within tim s stability band this agreement provides further evidence that tsi variations are primarily due to solar surface magnetic activity 20 instrument inaccuracies add a significant uncertainty in determining earth s energy balance the energy imbalance has been variously measured during a deep solar minimum of 2005 2010 to be 0.58 0.15 w m 21 0.60 0.17 w m 22 and 0.85 w m2 estimates from space-based measurements range from 3 to 7 w m2 sorce tim s lower tsi value reduces this discrepancy by 1 w m2 this difference between the new lower tim value and earlier tsi measurements corresponds to a climate forcing of 0.8 w m2 which is comparable to the energy imbalance 20 2014 reassessment edit in 2014 a new acrim composite was developed using the updated acrim3 record it added corrections for scattering and diffraction revealed during recent testing at trf and two algorithm updates the algorithm updates more accurately account for instrument thermal behavior and parsing of shutter cycle data these corrected a component of the quasi-annual signal and increased the signal to noise ratio respectively the net effect of these corrections decreased the average acrim3 tsi value without affecting the trending in the acrim composite tsi 23 differences between acrim and pmod tsi composites are evident but the most significant is the solar minimum-to-minimum trends during solar cycles 21-23 acrim established an increase of 0.037 decade from 1980 to 2000 and a decrease thereafter pmod instead presents a steady decrease since 1978 significant differences can also be seen during the peak of solar cycles 21 and 22 these arise from the fact that acrim uses the original tsi results published by the satellite experiment teams while pmod significantly modifies some results to conform them to specific tsi proxy models the implications of increasing tsi during the global warming of the last two decades of the 20th century are that solar forcing may be a significantly larger factor in climate change than represented in the cmip5 general circulation climate models 23 irradiance on earth s surface edit a pyranometer used to measure global irradiance a pyrheliometer mounted on a solar tracker is used to measure direct normal irradiance or beam irradiance average annual solar radiation arriving at the top of the earth s atmosphere is roughly 1361 w m2 24 the sun s rays are attenuated as they pass through the atmosphere leaving maximum normal surface irradiance at approximately 1000 w m2 at sea level on a clear day when 1361 w m2 is arriving above the atmosphere when the sun is at the zenith in a cloudless sky direct sun is about 1050 w m2 and global radiation on a horizontal surface at ground level is about 1120 w m2 25 the latter figure includes radiation scattered or reemitted by atmosphere and surroundings the actual figure varies with the sun s angle and atmospheric circumstances ignoring clouds the daily average insolation for the earth is approximately 6 kwh m2 21.6 mj m2 the output of for example a photovoltaic panel partly depends on the angle of the sun relative to the panel one sun is a unit of power flux not a standard value for actual insolation sometimes this unit is referred to as a sol not to be confused with a sol meaning one solar day 26 absorption and reflection edit part of the radiation reaching an object is absorbed and the remainder reflected usually the absorbed radiation is converted to thermal energy increasing the object s temperature manmade or natural systems however can convert part of the absorbed radiation into another form such as electricity or chemical bonds as in the case of photovoltaic cells or plants the proportion of reflected radiation is the object s reflectivity or albedo projection effect edit one sunbeam one mile wide shines on the ground at a 90 angle and another at a 30 angle the oblique sunbeam distributes its light energy over twice as much area insolation onto a surface is largest when the surface directly faces is normal to the sun as the angle between the surface and the sun moves from normal the insolation is reduced in proportion to the angle s cosine see effect of sun angle on climate in the figure the angle shown is between the ground and the sunbeam rather than between the vertical direction and the sunbeam hence the sine rather than the cosine is appropriate a sunbeam one mile 1.6 km wide arrives from directly overhead and another at a 30 angle to the horizontal the sine of a 30 angle is 1 2 whereas the sine of a 90 angle is 1 therefore the angled sunbeam spreads the light over twice the area consequently half as much light falls on each square mile this projection effect is the main reason why earth s polar regions are much colder than equatorial regions on an annual average the poles receive less insolation than does the equator because the poles are always angled more away from the sun than the tropics and moreover receive no insolation at all for the six months of their respective winters absorption effect edit at a lower angle the light must also travel through more atmosphere this attenuates it by absorption and scattering further reducing insolation at the surface attenuation is governed by the beer-lambert law namely that the transmittance or fraction of insolation reaching the surface decreases exponentially in the optical depth or absorbance the two notions differing only by a constant factor of ln 10 2.303 of the path of insolation through the atmosphere for any given short length of the path the optical depth is proportional to the quantity of absorbers and scatterers along that length typically increasing with decreasing altitude the optical depth of the whole path is then the integral sum of those optical depths along the path when the density of absorbers is layered that is depends much more on vertical than horizontal position in the atmosphere to a good approximation the optical depth is inversely proportional to the projection effect that is to the cosine of the zenith angle since transmittance decreases exponentially with increasing optical depth as the sun approaches the horizon there comes a point when absorption dominates projection for the rest of the day with a relatively high level of absorbers this can be a considerable portion of the late afternoon and likewise of the early morning conversely in the hypothetical total absence of absorption the optical depth remains zero at all altitudes of the sun that is transmittance remains 1 and so only the projection effect applies solar potential maps edit north america south america europe africa and

0.75 1 solar power edit solar irradiation figures are used to plan the deployment of solar power systems 27 in many countries the figures can be obtained from an insolation map or from insolation tables that reflect data over the prior 30 50 years different solar power technologies are able to use different component of the total irradiation while solar photovoltaics panels are able to convert to electricity both direct irradiation and diffuse irradiation concentrated solar power is only able to operate efficiently with direct irradiation thus making these systems suitable only in locations with relatively low cloud cover because solar collectors panels are almost always mounted at an angle 28 towards the sun insolation must be adjusted to prevent estimates that are inaccurately low for winter and inaccurately high for summer 29 this also means that the amount of sun falling on a solar panel at high latitude is not as low compared to one at the equator as would appear from just considering insolation on a horizontal surface photovoltaic panels are rated under standard conditions to determine the wp rating watts peak 30 which can then be used with insolation to determine the expected output adjusted by factors such as tilt tracking and shading which can be included to create the installed wp rating 31 insolation values range from 800 to 950 kwh kwp y in norway to up to 2,900 kwh kwp y in australia buildings edit in construction insolation is an important consideration when designing a building for a particular site 32 insolation variation by month 1984 1993 averages for january top and april bottom the projection effect can be used to design buildings that are cool in summer and warm in winter by providing vertical windows on the equator-facing side of the building the south face in the northern hemisphere or the north face in the southern hemisphere this maximizes insolation in the winter months when the sun is low in the sky and minimizes it in the summer when the sun is high the sun s north south path through the sky spans 47 degrees through the year civil engineering edit in civil engineering and hydrology numerical models of snowmelt runoff use observations of insolation this permits estimation of the rate at which water is released from a melting snowpack field measurement is accomplished using a pyranometer climate research edit irradiance plays a part in climate modeling and weather forecasting a non-zero average global net radiation at the top of the atmosphere is indicative of earth s thermal disequilibrium as imposed by climate forcing the impact of the lower 2014 tsi value on climate models is unknown a few tenths of a percent change in the absolute tsi level is typically considered to be of minimal consequence for climate simulations the new measurements require climate model parameter adjustments experiments with giss model 3 investigated the sensitivity of model performance to the tsi absolute value during present and pre-industrial epochs and describe for example how the irradiance reduction is partitioned between the atmosphere and surface and the effects on outgoing radiation 20 assessing the impact of long-term irradiance changes on climate requires greater instrument stability 20 combined with reliable global surface temperature observations to quantify climate response processes to radiative forcing on decadal time scales the observed 0.1 irradiance increase imparts 0.22 w m2 climate forcing which suggests a transient climate response of 0.6 c per w m2 this response is larger by a factor of 2 or more than in the ipcc-assessed 2008 models possibly appearing in the models heat uptake by the ocean 20 space travel edit insolation is the primary variable affecting equilibrium temperature in spacecraft design and planetology solar activity and irradiance measurement is a concern for space travel for example the american space agency nasa launched its solar radiation and climate
