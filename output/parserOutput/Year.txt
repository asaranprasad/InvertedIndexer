year - wikipedia year from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a year is the orbital period of the earth moving in its orbit around the sun due to the earth s axial tilt the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons marked by changes in weather the hours of daylight and consequently vegetation and soil fertility in temperate and subpolar regions around the planet four seasons are generally recognized spring summer autumn and winter in tropical and subtropical regions several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons but in the seasonal tropics the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked the current year is 2018 a calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the earth s orbital period as counted in a given calendar the gregorian or modern calendar presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days as do the julian calendars see below for the gregorian calendar the average length of the calendar year the mean year across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days the iso standard iso 80000-3 annex c supports the symbol a for latin annus to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days in english the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used in astronomy the julian year is a unit of time it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds si base unit totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the julian astronomical year 1 the word year is also used for periods loosely associated with but not identical to the calendar or astronomical year such as the seasonal year the fiscal year the academic year etc similarly year can mean the orbital period of any planet for example a martian year or a venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit the term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle such as the great year 2 contents 1 etymology 2 civil year 2.1 in international calendars 2.2 in

astronomical year has an integer number of days or lunar months so any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of intercalation such as leap years financial and scientific calculations often use a 365-day calendar to simplify daily rates in international calendars edit in the julian calendar the average mean length of a year is 365.25 days in a non-leap year there are 365 days in a leap year there are 366 days a leap year occurs every fourth year or leap year during which a leap day is intercalated into the month of february the name leap day is applied to the added day the gregorian calendar attempts to cause the northward equinox to fall on or shortly before march 21 and hence it follows the northward equinox year or tropical year 3 because 97 out of 400 years are leap years the mean length of the gregorian calendar year is 365.2425 days this is within one ppm of the current length of the mean tropical year 365.24219 days and even closer to the current march equinox year of 365.242374 days that it aims to match it is estimated that by the year 4000 ce the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the gregorian calendar not because of this difference but due to the slowing of the earth s rotation and the associated lengthening of the day the revised julian calendar as used in some eastern orthodox churches currently does a better job than the gregorian in synchronizing with the mean tropical year as 218 out of every 900 years are leap years the average mean length of this julian year is 7002365242222200000 365.2422222 days which is closer to the length of the mean tropical year 7002365242190000000 365.24219 days than is the gregorian mean year 365.242 5 days in the year 2800 ce the gregorian and revised julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day 4 a calendar era assigns a cardinal number to each sequential year using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era worldwide the most commonly used calendar era is referenced from the traditional now believed incorrect year of the birth of jesus dates in this era are designated anno domini latin for in the year of the lord abbreviated ad or the secular common era abbreviated ce the year before 1 ad or 1 ce is designated 1 before christ bc or 1 before the common era bce and the year before that is 2 bc 2 bce etc hence there was no year 0 ad 0 ce when computations are done involving both years ad and years bc it is common to use astronomical year numbering in which 1 bc is designated 0 2 bc is designated 1 and so on other eras are also used to enumerate the years in different cultural religious or scientific contexts in the persian calendar edit the persian calendar in use in afghanistan and iran has its year begin at the midnight closest to the instant of the northward equinox as determined by astronomical computation for the time zone of tehran as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years fiscal year edit a fiscal year or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations in many jurisdictions regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year for example in canada and india the fiscal year runs from april 1 in the united kingdom it runs from april 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements but from april 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits in australia it runs from july 1 while in the united states the fiscal year of the federal government runs from october 1 academic year edit an academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an educational institution the academic year may be divided into academic terms such as semesters or quarters the school year in many countries starts in august or september and ends in may june or july in israel the academic year begins around october or november aligned with the second month of the hebrew calendar some schools in the uk and usa divide the academic year into three roughly equal-length terms called trimesters or quarters in the usa roughly coinciding with autumn winter and spring at some a shortened summer session sometimes considered part of the regular academic year is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis other schools break the year into two main semesters a first typically august through december and a second semester january through may each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams and each of the halves is referred to as a quarter or term in some countries there may also be a voluntary summer session and or a short january session some other schools including some in the united states have four marking periods some schools in the united states notably boston latin school may divide the year into five or more marking periods some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a positive correlation between report frequency and academic achievement there are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the usa excluding weekends and breaks while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in canada new zealand and the united kingdom and 200 for pupils in australia in india the academic year normally starts from june 1 and ends on may 31 though schools start closing from mid-march the actual academic closure is on may 31 and in nepal it starts from july 15 citation needed schools and universities in australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year i e starting in february or march and ending in october to december as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from december to february in the international system of quantities edit in the international system of quantities the year symbol a is defined as either 365 days or 366 days astronomical years edit julian year edit the julian year as used in astronomy and other sciences is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days this is the normal meaning of the unit year symbol a from the latin annus used in various scientific contexts the julian century of 7004365250000000000 36525 days and the julian millennium of 7005365250000000000 365250 days are used in astronomical calculations fundamentally expressing a time interval in julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days not how many real years for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive by convention the julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a light-year in the unified code for units of measure the symbol a without subscript always refers to the julian year aj of exactly

megaannus etc sidereal tropical and anomalistic years edit each of these three years can be loosely called an astronomical year the sidereal year is the time taken for the earth to complete one revolution of its orbit as measured against a fixed frame of reference such as the fixed stars latin sidera singular sidus its average duration is 7002365256363004000 365.256363004 days 365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s at the epoch j2000.0 january 1 2000 12 00 00 tt 5 today the mean tropical year is defined as the period of time for the mean ecliptic longitude of the sun to increase by 360 degrees 6 since the sun s ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox 7 the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons because of the biological and socio-economic importance of the seasons the tropical year is the basis of most calendars the modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of e g the northward equinox for several reasons explained below because of the earth s axial precession this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year the mean tropical year is approximately 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 45 seconds using the modern definition 8 7002365242190000000 365.24219 days of 86400 si seconds the anomalistic year is the time taken for the earth to complete one revolution with respect to its apsides the orbit of the earth is elliptical the extreme points called apsides are the perihelion where the earth is closest to the sun january 3 in 2011 and the aphelion where the earth is farthest from the sun july 4 in 2011 the anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages its average duration is 7002365259636000000 365.259636 days 365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s at the epoch j2011.0 9 draconic year edit the draconic year draconitic year eclipse year or ecliptic year is the time taken for the sun as seen from the earth to complete one revolution with respect to the same lunar node a point where the moon s orbit intersects the ecliptic the year is associated with eclipses these occur only when both the sun and the moon are near these nodes so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year hence there are two eclipse seasons every eclipse year the average duration of the eclipse year is 7002346620075883000 346.620075883 days 346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s at the epoch j2000.0 this term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of lunar precession that is the period of a complete revolution of the moon s ascending node around the ecliptic

complete one revolution with respect to the perigee of the moon s orbit this period is associated with the apparent size of the full moon and also with the varying duration of the synodic month the duration of one full moon cycle is 7002411784430290000 411.78443029 days 411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 34 seconds at the epoch j2000.0 lunar year edit the lunar year comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the moon as seen from earth it has a duration of approximately 354.37 days muslims use this for celebrating their eids and for marking the start of the fasting month of ramadan a muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle vague year edit the vague year from annus vagus or wandering year is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days which wanders in relation to more exact years typically the vague year is divided into 12 schematic months of 30 days each plus 5 epagomenal days the vague year was used in the calendars of ancient egypt iran armenia and in mesoamerica among the aztecs and maya 10 it is still used by many zoroastrian communities heliacal year edit a heliacal year is the interval between the heliacal risings of a star it differs from the sidereal year for stars away from the ecliptic due mainly to the precession of the equinoxes sothic year edit the sothic year is the interval between heliacal risings of the star sirius it is currently less than the sidereal year and its duration is very close to the julian year of 365.25 days gaussian year edit the gaussian year is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass relative to the sun and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the gaussian gravitational constant such a planet would be slightly closer to the sun than earth s mean distance its length is 7002365256898300000 365.2568983 days 365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s besselian year edit the besselian year is a tropical year that starts when the fictitious mean sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280 this is currently on or close to january 1 it is named after the 19th-century german astronomer and mathematician friedrich bessel the following equation can be used to compute the current besselian epoch

scale or its predecessor ephemeris time variation in the length of the year and the day edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed october 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message the exact length of an astronomical year changes over time the positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of earth s orbit change the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of precession and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets since the speed of the earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion earth s speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time if such a point moves toward perihelion the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year if the point moves towards aphelion that period increases a little from year to year so a tropical year measured from one passage of the northward vernal equinox to the next differs from the one measured between passages of the southward autumnal equinox the average over the full orbit does not change because of this so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect each planet s movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet this leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed and therefore its period from year to year moreover it causes long-term changes in its orbit and therefore also long-term changes in these periods tidal drag between the earth and the moon and sun increases the length of the day and of the month by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the earth to the revolution of the moon since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life the length of the year appears to decrease the rotation rate of the earth is also changed by factors such as post-glacial rebound and sea level rise numerical value of year variation edit mean year lengths in this section are calculated for

ecliptic its length is about 25,700 years and cannot be determined precisely enough yet as the precession speed depends on too many factors causing not yet predictable variation galactic year edit the galactic year is the time it takes earth s solar system to revolve once around the galactic center it comprises roughly 230 million earth years 16 seasonal year edit a seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river the migration of a species of bird the flowering of a species of plant the first frost or the first scheduled game of a certain sport all of these events can have wide variations of more than a month from year to year symbols edit in the international system of quantities the symbol for the year as a unit of time is a taken from the latin word annus 17 in english the abbreviations y or yr are more commonly used in non-scientific literature but also specifically in geology and paleontology where kyr myr byr thousands millions and billions of years respectively and similar abbreviations are used to denote intervals of time remote from the present 17 18 19 symbol edit nist sp811 20 and iso 80000-3 2006 21 support the symbol a as the unit of time for a year in english the abbreviations y and yr are also used 17 18 19 the unified code for units of measure 22 disambiguates the varying symbologies of iso 1000 iso 2955 and ansi x3.50 23 by using at 7002365242190000000 365.24219 days for the mean tropical year aj 365.25 days for the mean julian year ag 7002365242500000000 365.2425 days for the mean gregorian year where a without a qualifier 1 a j and ar for are is a unit of area the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and the international union of geological sciences have jointly recommended defining the annus with symbol a as the length of the tropical year in the year 2000 a 7007315569254450000 31556925.445 seconds approximately 7002365242192650000 365.24219265 ephemeris days this differs from the above definition of 365.25 days by about 20 parts per million the joint document says that definitions such as the julian year bear an inherent pre-programmed obsolescence because of the variability of earth s orbital movement but then proposes using the length of the tropical year as of 2000 ad specified down to the millisecond which suffers from the same problem 24 25 the tropical year oscillates with time by more than a minute the notation has proved controversial as it conflicts with an earlier convention among geoscientists to use a specifically for years ago and y or yr for a one-year time period 25 si prefix multipliers edit for the following there are alternative forms which elide the consecutive vowels such as kilannus megannus etc the exponents and exponential notations are typically used for calculating and in displaying calculations and for conserving space as in tables of data ka for kiloannus a unit of time equal to one thousand or 103 years or 1 e3 yr also known as a millennium in anthropology and calendar uses the prefix multiplier ka is typically used in geology paleontology and archaeology for the holocene and pleistocene periods where a non radiocarbon dating technique e g ice core dating dendrochronology uranium-thorium dating or varve analysis is used as the primary dating method for age determination if age is primarily determined by radiocarbon dating then the age should be expressed in either radiocarbon or calendar calibrated years before present ma for megaannus a unit of time equal to one million or 106 years or 1 e6 yr the suffix ma is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as geology paleontology and celestial mechanics to signify very long time periods into the past or future for example the dinosaur species tyrannosaurus rex was abundant approximately 66 ma 66 million years ago the duration term ago may not always be indicated if the quantity of a duration is specified while not explicitly mentioning a duration term one can assume that ago is implied the alternative unit mya does include ago explicitly it also written as million years ago in works for general public use in astronomical applications the year used is the julian year of precisely 365.25 days in geology and paleontology the year is not so precise and varies depending on the author ga for gigaannus a unit of time equal to 109 years or 1 e9 yr one billion years short scale one thousand million years long scale ga is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as cosmology and geology to signify extremely long time periods in the past for example the formation of the earth occurred approximately 4.54 ga 4.54 billion years ago ta for teraannus a unit of time equal to 1012 years or 1 e12 yr one trillion years short scale one billion years long scale ta is an extremely long unit of time about 70 times as long as the age of the universe it is the same order of magnitude as the expected life span of a small red dwarf pa for petaannus a unit of time equal to 1015 years or 1 e15 yr one quadrillion short scale one thousand billion long scale the half-life of the nuclide cadmium-113 is about 8 pa 26 this symbol coincides with that for the pascal without a multiplier prefix though both are infrequently used and context will normally be sufficient to distinguish time from pressure values ea for exaannus a unit of time equal to 1018 years or 1 e18 yr one quintillion years short scale one trillion years long scale the half-life of tungsten-180 is 1.8 ea 27 abbreviations yr and ya edit in astronomy geology and paleontology the abbreviation yr for years and ya for years ago are sometimes used combined with prefixes for thousand million or billion 18 28 they are not si units using y to abbreviate the english year but following ambiguous international recommendations use either the standard english first letters as prefixes t m and b or metric prefixes k m and g or variations on metric prefixes k m g these abbreviations include non-si abbreviation si-prefixed equivalent order of magnitude kyr ka thousand years myr or myr ma million years byr ga billion years thousand million years kya or tya ka ago appearance of homo sapiens circa 200 kya out-of-africa migration circa 60 kya last glacial maximum circa 20 kya neolithic revolution circa 10 kya mya or mya ma ago pliocene 5.3

bang 13.8 bya use of mya and bya is deprecated in modern geophysics the recommended usage being ma and ga for dates before present but m y for the duration of epochs 18 19 this ad hoc distinction between absolute time and time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members of the geological society of america 30 note that on graphs using ya units on the horizontal axis time flows from right to left which may seem counter-intuitive if the ya units are on the vertical axis time flows from top to bottom which is probably easier to understand than conventional notation clarification

of a stratigraphic unit or the time of a geologic event as commonly determined by numerical dating or by reference to a calibrated time-scale may be expressed in years before the present the unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide recommended but not mandatory abbreviations for such ages are si international system of units multipliers coupled with a for annus ka ma and ga for kilo-annus 103 years mega-annus 106 years and giga-annus 109 years respectively use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of c-14 dating the present refers to ad 1950 and such qualifiers as ago or before the present are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation in contrast the duration of a remote interval of geologic time as a number of years should not be expressed by the same symbols abbreviations for numbers of years without reference to the present are informal e g y or yr for years my m y or m yr for millions of years and so forth as preference dictates for example boundaries of the late cretaceous epoch currently are calibrated at 63 ma and 96 ma
