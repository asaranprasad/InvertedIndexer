31.3 period 97.4 min yohkoh sunbeam in japanese known before launch as solar-a was a solar observatory spacecraft of the institute of space and astronautical science japan in collaboration with space agencies in the united states and the united kingdom it was launched into earth orbit on august 30 1991 by the m-3s-5 rocket from kagoshima space center it took its first soft x-ray image on september 13 1991 21 53 40 1 and movie representations of the x-ray corona over 1991-2001 are available at the contents 1 description 2 instruments 3 references 4 external links description edit the satellite was three-axis stabilized and in a near-circular orbit it carried four instruments a soft x-ray telescope sxt a hard x-ray telescope hxt a bragg crystal spectrometer bcs and a wide band spectrometer wbs about 50 mb were generated each day and stored on board by a 10.5 mb bubble memory recorder because sxt utilized a charge-coupled device ccd as its readout device perhaps being the first x-ray astronomical telescope to do so its data cube of images was both extensive and convenient and it revealed much interesting detail about the behavior of the solar corona previous solar soft x-ray observations such as those of skylab had been restricted to film as a readout device yohkoh therefore returned many novel scientific results especially regarding solar flares and other forms of magnetic activity 2 the mission ended after more than ten years of successful observation when it went into its safehold mode during an annular eclipse on december 14 2001 20 58 33 and the spacecraft lost lock on the sun operational mistakes and other flaws combined in such a way that its solar panels could no longer charge the batteries which drained irreversibly several other solar eclipses had successfully been observed on september 12 2005 the spacecraft burned up during reentry over south asia the time of reentry as provided by the u s space surveillance network was 6 16 pm japan standard time jst instruments edit yohkoh carried four instruments 3 the soft x-ray telescope sxt 4 was an x-ray telescope with glancing incidence x-ray mirror and a ccd sensor there was also a co-aligned optical telescope using the same ccd but after the failure of the entrance filter in november 1992 it became unusable the ccd was 1024 1024 pixels with pixel angular size of 2.45 2.45 a point-spread function core width fwhm of about 1.5 pixels i e 3.7 a field of view of 42 42 which was a little larger than the whole solar disk typical time resolution was 2 s in flare mode and 8 s in quiet no flare mode the maximum time resolution in 0.5 s for spectral discrimination stx employed wide-band filters installed on a filter wheel there were five usable filter positions 1265 -thick al filter 2.5 36 pass band al mg mn filter 2.4 32 2.52 m mg filter 2.4 23 11.6 m al filter 2.4 13 119 m be filter 2.3 10 before the entrance filter failure in november 1992 three more filter positions were available no analysis filter 2.5 46 wide band optical filter 4600 4800 narrow band optical filter 4290 4320 the hard x-ray telescope hxt 5 was a fourier-synthesis x-ray imager with 64 bigrid collimators sparsely sampling the u v plane and feeding individual scintillation-counter detectors hxt was sensitive to photons with energies from 14 kev to 93 kev this range was divided into four energy bands called l m1 m2 h the angular resolution was about 5 image synthesis field of view is 2 2 maximum time resolution was 0.5 s bragg crystal spectrometer bcs was two bent crystal spectrometers sensitive in four spectral lines the line of ion fe xxvi 1.76 1.81 ion fe xxv 1.83 1.90 ion ca xix 3.16 3.19 and ion s xv 5.02 5.11 spectral resolution varied in the range of 3000 8000 typical time resolution in flare mode was 8 s maximum is 0.125 s bcs integrates radiation over the whole solar disc wide band spectrometer wbs had spectroscopic capabilities in a wide energy band from 3 kev to 100 mev wbs was a set of four subinstruments e ch of them outputs pulse count pc corresponding to intensity integrated over a band and pulse height ph profile which corresponded to spectrum time resolution for pc 0.125 s 4 s for different subinstruments and modes was 8 16 times better than for ph 1 s 32 s wbs integrated radiation over the whole sun and did not resolve source position soft x-ray spectrometer sxs consisted of two proportional gas counters with nominal energy band 5 kev 40 kev which was divided into two pc channels and 128 ph channels it was found after the launch that ph to energy relationship was distorted no energy calibration for wbs ph data was available in 1999 hard x-ray spectrometer hxs was a nai tl scintillator the energy band after june 1992 was 24 kev 830 kev it was divided into 2 pc channels and 32 ph channels gamma-ray spectrometer grs consisted of two identical bismuth germanate oxide scintillators it covered energy range 0.3 mev 100 mev which was divided into 6 pc channels and 128 16 ph channels radiation belt monitor rbm unlike the other three was not aimed at solar flare observations and served to sound the alarm for radiation belt
