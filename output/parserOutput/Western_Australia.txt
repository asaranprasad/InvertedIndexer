surpassed only by russia s sakha republic the state has about 2.6 million inhabitants around 11 of the national total with 92 living in the south-west corner mostly in the perth area 3 leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated the first european visitor to western australia was the dutch explorer dirk hartog who visited the western australian coast in 1616 the first european settlement of western australia occurred following the landing by major edmund lockyer on 26 december 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the new south wales colonial government 4 he established a convict-supported military garrison at king george iii sound at present-day albany and on 21 january 1827 4 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the british crown this was followed by the establishment of the swan river colony in 1829 including the site of the present-day capital perth york was the first inland settlement in western australia situated 97 kilometres east of perth it was settled on 16 september 1831 5 western australia achieved responsible government in 1890 and federated with the other british colonies in australia in 1901 today its economy

2.5 million km2 11 natural history edit geology edit the bulk of western australia consists of the extremely old yilgarn craton and pilbara craton which merged with the deccan plateau of india madagascar and the karoo and zimbabwe cratons of southern africa in the archean eon to form ur one of the oldest supercontinents on earth 3 3.2 billion years ago in may 2017 evidence of the earliest known life on land may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits often found around hot springs and geysers uncovered in the pilbara craton 12 13 because the only mountain-building since then has been of the stirling range with the rifting from antarctica the land is extremely eroded and ancient with no part of the state above 1,245 metres 4,085 ft ahd at mount meharry in the hamersley range of the pilbara region most of the state is a low plateau with an average elevation of about 400 metres 1,200 ft very low relief and no surface runoff this descends relatively sharply to the coastal plains in some cases forming a sharp escarpment as with the darling range darling scarp near perth western australian cities towns settlements and road network the extreme age of the landscape has meant that the soils are remarkably infertile and frequently laterised even soils derived from granitic bedrock contain an order of magnitude less available phosphorus and only half as much nitrogen as soils in comparable climates in other continents soils derived from extensive sandplains or ironstone are even less fertile nearly devoid of soluble phosphate and deficient in zinc copper molybdenum and sometimes potassium and calcium the infertility of most of the soils has required heavy application by farmers of fertilizers these have resulted in damage to invertebrate and bacterial populations citation needed the grazing and use of hoofed mammals and later heavy machinery through the years have resulted in compaction of soils and great damage to the fragile soils large-scale land clearing for agriculture has damaged habitats for native flora and fauna as a result the south west region of the state has a higher concentration of rare threatened or endangered flora and fauna than many areas of australia making it one of the world s biodiversity hot spots large areas of the state s wheatbelt region have problems with dryland salinity and the loss of fresh water climate edit k ppen climate types in western australia the southwest coastal area has a mediterranean climate it was originally heavily forested including large stands of karri one of the tallest trees in the world 14 this agricultural region is one of the nine most bio-diverse terrestrial habitats with a higher proportion of endemic species than most other equivalent regions thanks to the offshore leeuwin current the area is one of the top six regions for marine biodiversity and contains the most southerly coral reefs in the world average annual rainfall varies from 300 millimetres 12 in at the edge of the wheatbelt region to 1,400 millimetres 55 in in the wettest areas near northcliffe but from november to march evaporation exceeds rainfall and it is generally very dry plants are adapted to this as well as the extreme poverty of all soils the central two-thirds of the state is arid and sparsely inhabited the only significant economic activity is mining annual rainfall averages less than 300 millimetres 8 10 in most of which occurs in sporadic torrential falls related to cyclone events in summer 15 an exception to this is the northern tropical regions the kimberley has an extremely hot monsoonal climate with average annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 1,500 millimetres 20 60 in but there is a very long almost rainless season from april to november eighty-five percent of the state s runoff occurs in the kimberley but because it occurs in violent floods and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils the only development has taken place along the ord river the black swan is the state bird of western australia the red and green kangaroo paw is the floral emblem of western australia snow is rare in the state and typically occurs only in the stirling range near albany as it is the only mountain range far enough south and sufficiently elevated more rarely snow can fall on the nearby porongurup range snow outside these areas is a major event it usually occurs in hilly areas of southwestern australia the most widespread low-level snow occurred on 26 june 1956 when snow was reported in the perth hills as far north as wongan hills and as far east as salmon gums however even in the stirling range snowfalls rarely exceed 5 cm 2 in and rarely settle for more than one day 16

edit john forrest was the first premier of western australia ngaanyatjarra children native to the desert regions of western australia the first inhabitants of australia arrived from the north about 40,000 to 60,000 years ago over thousands of years they eventually spread across the whole landmass these indigenous australians were long established throughout western australia by the time european explorers began to arrive in the early 17th century the first european to visit western australia was a dutch explorer dirk hartog who on 25 october 1616 landed at what is now known as cape inscription dirk hartog island for the rest of the 17th century other dutch and british navigators encountered the coast usually unintentionally as demonstrated by the many shipwrecks along the coast of ships that deviated from the brouwer route because of poor navigation and storms 21 two hundred years passed before europeans believed that the great southern continent actually existed by the late 18th century british and french sailors had begun to explore the western australian coast the origins of the present state began with the establishment by lockyer 4 of a convict-supported settlement from new south wales at king george iii sound the settlement was formally annexed on 21 january 1827 by lockyer when he commanded the union jack be raised and a feu de joie fired by the troops the settlement was founded in response to british concerns about the possibility of a french colony being established on the coast of western australia 4 on 7 march 1831 it was transferred to the control of the swan river colony 5 and named albany in 1832 in 1829 the swan river colony was established on the swan river by captain james stirling by 1832 the british settler population of the colony had reached around 1,500 and the official name of the colony was changed to western australia the two separate townsites of the colony developed slowly into the port city of fremantle and the state s capital perth york was the first inland settlement in western australia situated 97 kilometres east of perth and settled on 16 september 1831 york was the staging point for early explorers who discovered the rich gold reserves of kalgoorlie population growth was very slow until significant discoveries of gold were made in the 1890s around kalgoorlie in 1887 a new constitution was drafted providing for the right of self-governance of european australians and in 1890 the act granting self-government to the colony was passed by the british parliament john forrest became the first premier of western australia in 1896 the western australian parliament authorised the raising of a loan to construct a pipeline to transport 23 megalitres 5 million imperial gallons of water per day to the goldfields of western australia the pipeline known as the goldfields water supply scheme was completed in 1903 c y o connor western australia s first engineer-in-chief designed and oversaw the construction of the pipeline it carries water 530 km 330 mi from perth to kalgoorlie and is attributed by historians as an important factor driving the state s population and economic growth 22 following a campaign led by forrest residents of the colony of western australia still informally called the swan river colony voted in favour of federation resulting in western australia officially

the continent perth was founded as the swan river colony in 1829 by british and irish settlers though the outpost languished its officials eventually requested convict labour to augment its population in the 1890s interstate immigration resulting from a mining boom in the goldfields region resulted in a sharp population increase western australia did not receive significant flows of immigrants from britain ireland or elsewhere in the british empire until the early 20th century at that time its local projects such as the group settlement scheme of the 1920s which encouraged farmers to settle the southwest increased awareness of australia s western third as a destination for colonists led by immigrants from the british isles western australia s population developed at a faster rate during the twentieth century than it had previously after world war ii both the eastern states and western australia received large numbers of italians croatians and macedonians despite this britain has contributed the greatest number of immigrants to this day western australia particularly perth has the highest proportion of british-born of any state 10.3 in 2011 compared to a national average of

western australia s resource commodity mix 2007 major commodity mix 2008 2009 western australia s economy is largely driven by extraction and processing of a diverse range of mineral and petroleum commodities the structure of the economy is closely linked to these natural resources providing a comparative advantage in resource extraction and processing as a consequence western australia contributes an estimated 58 of australia s mineral and energy exports 33 potentially earning up to 4.64 of australia s total gdp 34 gross state product per person 102,232 is higher than any other state and well above the national average 66,549 2 diversification i e a greater range of commodities over the past 15 years has provided a more balanced production base and less reliance on just a

increased their share of economic output 35 recent growth in global demand for minerals and petroleum especially in china iron-ore and japan for lng has ensured economic growth above the national average western australia s overseas exports accounted for 46 of the nation s total 6 36 the state s major export commodities include iron-ore alumina nickel gold ammonia wheat wool crude oil and liquefied natural gas lng western australia is a major extractor of bauxite which is also processed into alumina at four refineries providing more than 20 of total world production it is the world s

at collie is the main fuel for baseload electricity generation in the state s south-west agricultural production in wa is a major contributor to the state and national economy although tending to be highly seasonal 2006 07 wheat production in wa was nearly 10 million tonnes accounting for almost half the nation s total 37 and providing 1.7 billion in export income 38 other significant farm output includes barley peas 37 wool lamb and beef there is a high level of overseas demand for live animals from wa driven mainly by southeast asia s feedlots and middle eastern countries where cultural and religious traditions and a lack of storage and refrigeration facilities favour live animals over imports of processed meat about half of australia s live cattle exports come from western australia 39 resource sector growth in recent years has resulted in significant labour and skills shortages leading to recent efforts by the state government to encourage interstate and overseas immigration 40 according to the 2006 census 41 the median individual income was a 500 per week in western australia compared to a 466 in australia as a whole the median family income was a 1246 per week compared to a 1171 for australia recent growth has also contributed to significant rises in average property values in 2006 although values plateaued in 2007 perth property prices are still the second highest in

federation of the australian colonies in 1901 western australia became a state within australia s federal structure this involved ceding certain powers to the commonwealth or federal government in accordance with the constitution all powers not specifically granted to the commonwealth remained solely with the state however over time the commonwealth has effectively expanded its powers through increasing control of taxation and financial distribution whilst the sovereign of western australia is the queen of australia elizabeth ii and executive power nominally vested in her state

landscape since shortly after european settlement in 1826 western australia was the most reluctant participant in the commonwealth of australia 49 western australia did not participate in the earliest federation conference longer-term residents of western australia were generally opposed to federation however the discovery of gold brought many immigrants from other parts of australia it was these residents primarily in kalgoorlie but also in albany who voted to join the commonwealth and the proposal of these areas being admitted separately under the name auralia was considered citation needed in a referendum in april 1933 68 of voters voted for the state to leave the commonwealth of australia with the aim of returning to the british empire as an autonomous territory the state government sent a delegation to westminster but the british government refused to intervene and therefore no action was taken to implement this decision 50 local government edit western australia is divided into
