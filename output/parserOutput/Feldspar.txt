caal2si2o8 are a group of rock-forming tectosilicate minerals that make up about 41 of the earth s continental crust by weight 2 feldspars crystallize from magma as veins in both intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock 3 rock formed almost entirely of calcic plagioclase feldspar see below is known as anorthosite 4 feldspars are also found in many types of sedimentary rocks 5 contents 1 etymology 2 compositions 2.1 alkali feldspars 2.2 barium feldspars 2.3 plagioclase feldspars 3 weathering 4 production and uses 5 images 6 see also 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links etymology edit the name feldspar derives from the german feldspat a compound of the words feld field and spat a rock that does not contain ore 6 the change from spat to -spar was influenced by the english word spar 7 meaning a non-opaque mineral with good cleavage 8 feldspathic refers to materials that contain feldspar the alternate spelling felspar has largely fallen out of use compositions edit this group of minerals consists of tectosilicates compositions of major elements in common feldspars can be expressed in terms of three endmembers potassium feldspar k-spar endmember kalsi3o8 9 albite endmember naalsi3o8 9 anorthite endmember caal2si2o8 9 solid solutions between k-feldspar and albite are called alkali feldspar 9 solid solutions between albite and anorthite are called plagioclase 9 or more properly plagioclase feldspar only limited solid solution occurs between k-feldspar and anorthite and in the two other solid solutions immiscibility occurs at temperatures common in the crust of the earth albite is considered both a plagioclase and alkali feldspar alkali feldspars edit the alkali feldspars are as follows orthoclase monoclinic 10 kalsi3o8 sanidine monoclinic 11 k na alsi3o8 microcline triclinic 12 kalsi3o8 anorthoclase triclinic na k alsi3o8 sanidine is stable at the highest temperatures and microcline at the lowest 10 11 perthite is a typical texture in alkali feldspar due to exsolution of contrasting alkali feldspar compositions during cooling of an intermediate composition the perthitic textures in the alkali feldspars of many granites can be seen with the naked eye 13 microperthitic textures in crystals are visible using a light microscope whereas cryptoperthitic textures can be seen only with an electron microscope barium feldspars edit barium feldspars are also considered alkali feldspars barium feldspars form as the result of the substitution of barium for potassium in the mineral structure the barium feldspars are monoclinic and include the following celsian baal2si2o8 14 hyalophane k ba al si 4o8 15 plagioclase feldspars edit the plagioclase feldspars are triclinic the plagioclase series follows with percent anorthite in parentheses albite 0 to 10 naalsi3o8 oligoclase 10 to 30 na ca al si alsi2o8 andesine 30 to 50 naalsi3o8 caal2si2o8 labradorite 50 to 70 ca na al al si si2o8 bytownite 70 to 90 nasi caal alsi2o8 anorthite 90 to 100 caal2si2o8 intermediate compositions of plagioclase feldspar also may exsolve to two feldspars of contrasting composition during cooling but diffusion is much slower than in alkali feldspar and the resulting two-feldspar intergrowths typically are too fine-grained to be visible with optical microscopes the immiscibility gaps in the plagioclase solid solutions are complex compared to the gap in the alkali feldspars the play of colours visible in some feldspar of labradorite composition is due to very fine-grained exsolution lamellae the specific gravity in the plagioclase series increases from albite 2.62 g cm3 to anorthite 2.72 2.75 g cm3 weathering edit chemical weathering of feldspars results in the formation of clay minerals 16 such as illite and kaolinite production and uses edit about 20 million tonnes of feldspar were produced in 2010 mostly by three countries italy 4.7 mt turkey 4.5 mt and china 2 mt 17 feldspar is a common raw material used in glassmaking ceramics and to some extent as a filler and extender in paint plastics and rubber in glassmaking alumina from feldspar improves product hardness durability and resistance to chemical corrosion in ceramics the alkalis in feldspar calcium oxide potassium oxide and sodium oxide act as a flux lowering the melting temperature of a mixture fluxes melt at an early stage in the firing process forming a glassy matrix that bonds the other components of the system together in the us about 66 of feldspar is consumed in glassmaking including glass containers and glass fiber ceramics including electrical insulators sanitaryware pottery tableware and tile and other uses such as fillers accounted for the remainder 18 in earth sciences and archaeology feldspars are used for k-ar dating argon-argon dating and luminescence dating in october 2012 the mars curiosity rover analyzed a rock that turned out to have a high feldspar content 19
