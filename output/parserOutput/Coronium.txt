coronium - wikipedia coronium from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a solar eclipse coronium also called newtonium was the name of a suggested chemical element hypothesised in the 19th century the name inspired by the solar corona was given by a gruenwald in 1887 1 a new atomic thin green line in the solar corona was then considered to be emitted a new element unlike anything else seen under laboratory conditions because of this it was also mis-classified as iron line number 1474 2 contents 1 solar spectroscopy 2 see also 3 references 4 further reading 5 external links solar spectroscopy edit during the total solar eclipse of 7 august 1869 a green emission line of wavelength 530.3 nm was independently observed by charles augustus young 1834 1908 and william harkness 1837 1903 in the coronal spectrum since this line did not correspond to that of any known material it was proposed that it was due to an unknown element provisionally named coronium in 1902 in an attempt at a chemical conception of the aether the russian chemist and chemical educator dmitri mendeleev hypothesized that there existed two inert chemical elements of lesser atomic weight than hydrogen of these two he thought the lighter to be an all-penetrating all-pervasive gas and the slightly heavier one to be coronium later he renamed coronium as newtonium 3 it was not until the 1930s that walter grotrian and bengt edl n discovered that the spectral line at 530.3 nm was due to highly ionized iron fe13 other unusual lines in the coronal spectrum were also caused by highly charged ions such as nickel the high ionization being due to the extreme temperature of the solar corona 4 see also edit spectroscopy references edit a gruenwald chemical news vol lvi no 1462 2 december 1887 p 232 cosmos portal cosmos portal retrieved 3 december 2011 ede andrew 2006 the chemical element a historical perspective greenwood press pp 83 84 isbn 0-313-33304-1 morison ian 2008 wiley-blackwell p 61 isbn 0-470-03333-9 further reading edit claridge george c 1937 coronium journal of the royal astronomical society of canada 31 337 346 bibcode external links edit laser stars retrieved 2008-08-25 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title coronium oldid 797098945 categories misidentified chemical elements iron navigation menu search this page was last edited on 24 august 2017 at 23 45 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
