astronaut david scott from mission apollo 15 on the moon enacting the legend of galileo s gravity experiment 1.38 mb ogg theora format gravity or gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward or gravitate toward one another including objects ranging from atoms and photons to planets and stars since energy and mass are equivalent all forms of energy including light cause gravitation and are under the influence of it on earth gravity gives weight to physical objects and the moon s gravity causes the ocean tides the gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the universe caused it to begin coalescing forming stars and for the stars to group together into galaxies so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the universe gravity has an infinite range although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity proposed by albert einstein in 1915 which describes gravity not as a force but as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the uneven distribution of mass the most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole from which nothing not even light can escape once past the black hole s event horizon 1 however for most applications gravity is well approximated by newton s law of universal gravitation which describes gravity as a force which causes any two bodies to be attracted to each other with the force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces of physics approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong force 1036 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 1029 times weaker than the weak force as a consequence it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles 2 in contrast it is the dominant force at the macroscopic scale and is the cause of the formation shape and trajectory orbit of astronomical bodies for example gravity causes the earth and the other planets to orbit the sun it also causes the moon to orbit the earth and causes the formation of tides the formation and evolution of the solar system stars and galaxies the earliest instance of gravity in the universe possibly in the form of quantum gravity supergravity or a gravitational singularity along with ordinary space and time developed during the planck epoch up to 10 43 seconds after the birth of the universe possibly from a primeval state such as a false vacuum quantum vacuum or virtual particle in a currently unknown manner 3 attempts to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics a quantum gravity

scientific revolution modern work on gravitational theory began with the work of galileo galilei in the late 16th and early 17th centuries in his famous though possibly apocryphal 4 experiment dropping balls from the tower of pisa and later with careful measurements of balls rolling down inclines galileo showed that gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects this was a major departure from aristotle s belief that heavier objects have a higher gravitational acceleration 5 galileo postulated air resistance as the reason that objects with less mass may fall slower in an atmosphere galileo s work set the stage for the formulation of newton s theory of gravity 6 newton s theory of gravitation sir isaac newton an english physicist who lived from 1642 to 1727 in 1687 english mathematician sir isaac newton published principia which hypothesizes the inverse-square law of universal gravitation in his own words i deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth and found them answer pretty nearly 7 the equation is the following f g m 1 m 2 r 2 displaystyle f g frac m 1 m 2 r 2 where f is the force m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects interacting r is the distance between the centers of the masses and g is the gravitational constant newton s theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of neptune based on motions of uranus that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets calculations by both john couch adams and urbain le verrier predicted the general position of the planet and le verrier s calculations are what led johann gottfried galle to the discovery of neptune a discrepancy in mercury s orbit pointed out flaws in newton s theory by the end of the 19th century it was known that its orbit showed slight perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under newton s theory but all searches for another perturbing body such as a planet orbiting the sun even closer than mercury had been fruitless the issue was resolved in 1915 by albert einstein s new theory of general relativity which accounted for the small discrepancy in mercury s orbit although newton s theory has been superseded by einstein s general relativity most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations are still made using newton s theory because it is simpler to work with and it gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small masses speeds and energies equivalence principle the equivalence principle explored by a succession of researchers including galileo lor nd e tv s and einstein expresses the idea that all objects fall in the same way and that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from certain aspects of acceleration and deceleration the simplest way to test the weak equivalence principle is to drop two objects of different masses or compositions in a vacuum and see whether they hit the ground at the same time such experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when other forces such as air resistance and electromagnetic effects are negligible more sophisticated tests use a torsion balance of a type invented by e tv s satellite experiments for example step are planned for more accurate experiments in space 8 formulations of the equivalence principle include the weak equivalence principle the trajectory of a point mass in a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity and is independent of its composition 9 the einsteinian equivalence principle the outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime 10 the strong equivalence principle requiring both of the above general relativity two-dimensional analogy of spacetime distortion generated by the mass of an object matter changes the geometry of spacetime this curved geometry being interpreted as gravity white lines do not represent the curvature of space but instead represent the coordinate system imposed on the curved spacetime which would be rectilinear in a flat spacetime

hulse van stockum taub newman yau thorne others v t in general relativity the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of a force the starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle which equates free fall with inertial motion and describes free-falling inertial objects as being accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground 11 12 in newtonian physics however no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime these straight paths are called geodesics like newton s first law of motion einstein s theory states that if a force is applied on an object it would deviate from a geodesic for instance we are no longer following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance of the earth exerts an upward force on us and we are non-inertial on the ground as a result this explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial einstein discovered the field equations of general relativity which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after him the einstein field equations are a set of 10 simultaneous non-linear differential equations the solutions of the field equations are the components of the metric tensor of spacetime a metric tensor describes a geometry of spacetime the geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor solutions notable solutions of the einstein field equations include the schwarzschild solution which describes spacetime surrounding a spherically symmetric non-rotating uncharged massive object for compact enough objects this solution generated a black hole with a central singularity for radial distances from the center which are much greater than the schwarzschild radius the accelerations predicted by the schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by newton s theory of gravity the reissner-nordstr m solution in which the central object has an electrical charge for charges with a geometrized length which are less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object this solution produces black holes with double event horizons the kerr solution for rotating massive objects this solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons the kerr-newman solution for charged rotating massive objects this solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons the cosmological friedmann-lema tre-robertson-walker solution which predicts the expansion of the universe tests the tests of general relativity included the following 13 general relativity accounts for the anomalous perihelion precession of mercury 14 the prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials gravitational time dilation has been confirmed by the pound rebka experiment 1959 the hafele keating experiment and the gps the prediction of the deflection of light was first confirmed by arthur stanley eddington from his observations during the solar eclipse of 29 may 1919 15 16 eddington measured starlight deflections twice those predicted by newtonian corpuscular theory in accordance with the predictions of general relativity however his interpretation of the results was later disputed 17 more recent tests using radio interferometric measurements of quasars passing behind the sun have more accurately and consistently confirmed the deflection of light to the degree predicted by general relativity 18 see also gravitational lens the time delay of light passing close to a massive object was first identified by irwin i shapiro in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals gravitational radiation has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary pulsars on 11 february 2016 the ligo and virgo collaborations announced the first observation of a gravitational wave alexander friedmann in 1922 found that einstein equations have non-stationary solutions even in the presence of the cosmological constant in 1927 georges lema tre showed that static solutions of the einstein equations which are possible in the presence of the cosmological constant are unstable and therefore the static universe envisioned by einstein could not exist later in 1931 einstein himself agreed with the results of friedmann and lema tre thus general relativity predicted that the universe had to be non-static it had to either expand or contract the expansion of the universe discovered by edwin hubble in 1929 confirmed this prediction 19 the theory s prediction of frame dragging was consistent with the recent gravity probe b results 20 general relativity predicts that light should lose its energy when traveling away from massive bodies through gravitational redshift this was verified on earth and in the solar system around 1960 gravity and quantum mechanics in the decades after the discovery of general relativity it was realized that general relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics 21 it is possible to describe gravity in the framework of quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces such that the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons in the same way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons 22 23 this reproduces general relativity in the classical limit however this approach fails at short distances of the order of the planck length 21 where a more complete theory of quantum gravity or a new approach to quantum mechanics is required specifics earth s gravity an initially-stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time this image spans half a second and was captured at 20 flashes per second every planetary body including the earth is surrounded by its own gravitational field which can be conceptualized with newtonian physics as exerting an attractive force on all objects assuming a spherically symmetrical planet the strength of this field at any given point above the surface is proportional to the planetary body s mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the body if an object with comparable mass to that of the earth were to fall towards it then the corresponding acceleration of the earth would be observable the strength of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence 24 the rate of acceleration of falling objects near the earth s surface varies very slightly depending on latitude surface features such as mountains and ridges and perhaps unusually high or low sub-surface densities 25 for purposes of weights and measures a standard gravity value is defined by the international bureau of weights and measures under the international system of units si that value denoted g is g 9.80665 m s2 32.1740 ft s2 26 27 the standard value of 9.80665 m s2 is the one originally adopted by the international committee on weights and measures in 1901 for 45 latitude even though it has been shown to be too high by about five parts in ten thousand 28 this value has persisted in meteorology and in some standard atmospheres as the value for 45 latitude even though it applies more precisely to latitude of 45 32 33 29 assuming the standardized value for g and ignoring air resistance this means that an object falling freely near the earth s surface increases its velocity by 9.80665 m s 32.1740 ft s or 22 mph for each second of its descent thus an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.80665 m s 32.1740 ft s after one second approximately 19.62 m s 64.4 ft s after two seconds and so on adding 9.80665 m s 32.1740 ft s to each resulting velocity also again ignoring air resistance any and all objects when dropped from the same height will hit the ground at the same time according to newton s 3rd law the earth itself experiences a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that which it exerts on a falling object this means that the earth also accelerates towards the object until they collide because the mass of the earth is huge however the acceleration imparted to the earth by this opposite force is negligible in comparison to the object s if the object doesn t bounce after it has collided with the earth each of them then exerts a repulsive contact force on the other which effectively balances the attractive force of gravity and prevents further acceleration the apparent force of gravity on earth is the resultant vector sum of two forces 30 a the gravitational attraction in accordance with newton s universal law of gravitation and b the centrifugal force which results from the choice of an earthbound rotating frame of reference the force of gravity is the weakest at the equator because of the centrifugal force caused by the earth s rotation and because points on the equator are furthest from the center of the earth the force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780 m s2 at the equator to about 9.832 m s2 at the poles equations for a falling body near the surface of the earth under an assumption of constant gravitational attraction newton s law of universal gravitation simplifies to f mg where m is the mass of the body and g is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81 m s2 on earth this resulting force is the object s weight the acceleration due to gravity is equal to this g an initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time the image on the right spanning half a second was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second during the first 1 20 of a second the ball drops one unit of distance here a unit is about 12 mm by 2 20 it has dropped at total of 4 units by 3 20 9 units and so on under the same constant gravity assumptions the potential energy ep of a body at height h is given by ep mgh or ep wh with w meaning weight this expression is valid only over small distances h from the surface of the earth similarly the expression h v 2 2 g displaystyle h tfrac v 2 2g for the maximum height reached by a vertically projected body with initial velocity v is useful for small heights and small initial velocities only gravity and astronomy nature timeline view discuss -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0

and details of quasars even the existence of dark matter is inferred using newton s law of gravity although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the sun we know their masses these masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit in space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it planets orbit stars stars orbit galactic centers galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters and clusters orbit in superclusters the force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them the earliest gravity possibly in the form of quantum gravity supergravity or a gravitational singularity along with ordinary space and time developed during the planck epoch up to 10 43 seconds after the birth of the universe possibly from a primeval state such as a false vacuum quantum vacuum or virtual particle in a currently unknown manner 3 gravitational radiation according to general relativity gravitational radiation is generated in situations where the curvature of spacetime is oscillating such as is the case with co-orbiting objects the gravitational radiation emitted by the solar system is far too small to measure however gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as psr b1913 16 it is believed that neutron star mergers and black hole formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation gravitational radiation observatories such as the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ligo have been created to study the problem in february 2016 the advanced ligo team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision on 14 september 2015 ligo registered gravitational waves for the first time as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from earth 32 33 this observation confirms the theoretical predictions of einstein and others that such waves exist the event confirms that binary black holes exist it also opens the way for practical observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the universe including the big bang and what happened after it 34 35 speed of gravity in december 2012 a research team in china announced that it had produced measurements of the phase lag of earth tides during full and new moons which seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light 36 this means that if the sun suddenly disappeared the earth would keep orbiting it normally for 8 minutes which is the time light takes to travel that distance the team s findings were released in the chinese science bulletin in february 2013 37 in october 2017 the ligo and virgo detectors received gravitational wave signals within 2 seconds of gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes seeing signals from the same direction this confirmed that the speed of gravitational waves was the same as the speed of light 38 anomalies and discrepancies there are some observations that are not adequately accounted for which may point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be explained in other ways rotation curve of a typical spiral galaxy predicted a and observed b the discrepancy between the curves is attributed to dark matter extra-fast stars stars in galaxies follow a distribution of velocities where stars on the outskirts are moving faster than they should according to the observed distributions of normal matter galaxies within galaxy clusters show a similar pattern dark matter which would interact through gravitation but not electromagnetically would account for the discrepancy various modifications to newtonian dynamics have also been proposed flyby anomaly various spacecraft have experienced greater acceleration than expected during gravity assist maneuvers accelerating expansion the metric expansion of space seems to be speeding up dark energy has been proposed to explain this a recent alternative explanation is that the geometry of space is not homogeneous due to clusters of galaxies and that when the data are reinterpreted to take this into account the expansion is not speeding up after all 39 however this conclusion is disputed 40 anomalous increase of the astronomical unit recent measurements indicate that planetary orbits are widening faster than if this were solely through the sun losing mass by radiating energy extra energetic photons photons travelling through galaxy clusters should gain energy and then lose it again on the way out the accelerating expansion of the universe should stop the photons returning all the energy but even taking this into account photons from the cosmic microwave background radiation gain twice as much energy as expected this may indicate that gravity falls off faster than inverse-squared at certain distance scales 41 extra massive hydrogen clouds the spectral lines of the lyman-alpha forest suggest that hydrogen clouds are more clumped together at certain scales than expected and like dark flow may indicate that gravity falls off slower than inverse-squared at certain distance scales 41 alternative theories historical alternative theories aristotelian theory of
