list of unsolved problems in physics - wikipedia list of unsolved problems in physics from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search some of the major unsolved problems in physics are theoretical meaning that existing theories seem incapable of explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result the others are experimental meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail there are still some deficiencies in the standard model of physics such as the origin of mass the strong cp problem neutrino oscillations matter antimatter asymmetry and the nature of dark matter and dark energy 1 2 another problem lies within the mathematical framework of the standard model itself the standard model is inconsistent with that of general relativity to the point that one or both theories break down under certain conditions for example within known spacetime singularities like the big bang and the centers of black holes beyond the event horizon contents 1 unsolved problems by subfield 1.1 general physics quantum physics 1.2 cosmology and general relativity 1.3 quantum gravity 1.4

areas of physics 3 general physics quantum physics edit arrow of time e g entropy s arrow of time why does time have a direction why did the universe have such low entropy in the past and time correlates with the universal but not local increase in entropy from the past and to the future according to the second law of thermodynamics 4 why are cp violations observed in certain weak force decays but not elsewhere are cp violations somehow a product of the second law of thermodynamics or are they a separate arrow of time are there exceptions to the principle of causality is there a single possible past is the present moment physically distinct from the past and future or is it merely an emergent property of consciousness what links the quantum arrow of time to the thermodynamic arrow interpretation of quantum mechanics how does the quantum description of reality which includes elements such as the superposition of states and wavefunction collapse or quantum decoherence give rise to the reality we perceive 4 another way of stating this question regards the measurement problem what constitutes a measurement which apparently causes the wave function to collapse into a definite state unlike classical physical processes some quantum mechanical processes such as quantum teleportation arising from quantum entanglement cannot be simultaneously local causal and real but it is not obvious which of these properties must be sacrificed 5 or if an attempt to describe quantum mechanical processes in these senses is a category error such that a proper understanding of quantum mechanics would render the question meaningless grand unification theory theory of everything is there a theory which explains the values of all fundamental physical constants 4 is there a theory which explains why the gauge groups of the standard model are as they are and why observed spacetime has 3 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension do fundamental physical constants vary over time are any of the fundamental particles in the standard model of particle physics actually composite particles too tightly bound to observe as such at current experimental energies are there fundamental particles that have not yet been observed and if so which ones are they and what are their properties are there unobserved fundamental forces yang mills theory given an arbitrary compact gauge group does a non-trivial quantum yang mills theory with a finite mass gap exist this problem is also listed as one of the millennium prize problems in mathematics 6 physical information are there physical phenomena such as wave function collapse or black holes which irrevocably destroy information about their prior states 7 how is quantum information stored as a state of a quantum system dimensionless physical constant at the present time the values of the dimensionless physical constants cannot be calculated they are determined only by physical measurement 8 9 what is the minimum number of dimensionless physical constants from which all other dimensionless physical constants can be derived are dimensional physical constants necessary at all fine-tuned universe the values of the fundamental physical constants are in a narrow range necessary to support carbon-based life 10 11 12 is this because there exist other universes with different constants or are our universe s constants the result of chance or some other factor or process quantum field theory is it possible to construct in the mathematically rigorous framework of algebraic qft a theory in 4-dimensional spacetime that includes interactions and does not resort to perturbative methods 13 14 cosmology and general relativity edit problem of time in quantum mechanics time is a classical background parameter and the flow of time is universal and absolute in general relativity time is one component of four-dimensional spacetime and the flow of time changes depending on the curvature of spacetime and the spacetime trajectory of the observer how can these two concepts of time be reconciled 15 cosmic inflation is the theory of cosmic inflation in the very early universe correct and if so what are the details of this epoch what is the hypothetical inflaton scalar field that gave rise to this cosmic inflation if inflation happened at one point is it self-sustaining through inflation of quantum-mechanical fluctuations and thus ongoing in some extremely distant place 16 horizon problem why is the distant universe so homogeneous when the big bang theory seems to predict larger measurable anisotropies of the night sky than those observed cosmological inflation is generally accepted as the solution but are other possible explanations such as a variable speed of light more appropriate 17 origin and future of the universe how did the conditions for anything to exist arise is the universe heading towards a big freeze a big rip a big crunch or a big bounce or is it part of an infinitely recurring cyclic model size of universe the diameter of the observable universe is about 93 billion light-years but what is the size of the whole universe does a multiverse exist baryon asymmetry why is there far more matter than antimatter in the observable universe cosmological constant problem why does the zero-point energy of the vacuum not cause a large cosmological constant what cancels it out 18 19 estimated distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe dark matter galaxy rotation curve what is the identity of dark matter 17 is it a particle is it the lightest superpartner lsp or do the phenomena attributed to dark matter point not to some form of matter but actually to an extension of gravity dark energy what is the cause of the observed accelerated expansion de sitter phase of the universe why is the energy density of the dark energy component of the same magnitude as the density of matter at present when the two evolve quite differently over time could it be simply that we are observing at exactly the right time is dark energy a pure cosmological constant or are models of quintessence such as phantom energy applicable dark flow is a non-spherically symmetric gravitational pull from outside the observable universe responsible for some of the observed motion of large objects such as galactic clusters in the universe axis of evil some large features of the microwave sky at distances of over 13 billion light years appear to be aligned with both the motion and orientation of the solar system is this due to systematic errors in processing contamination of results by local effects or an unexplained violation of the copernican principle shape of the universe what is the 3-manifold of comoving space i e of a comoving spatial section of the universe informally called the shape of the universe neither the curvature nor the topology is presently known though the curvature is known to be close to zero on observable scales the cosmic inflation hypothesis suggests that the shape of the universe may be unmeasurable but since 2003 jean-pierre luminet et al and other groups have suggested that the shape of the universe may be the poincar dodecahedral space is the shape unmeasurable the poincar space or another 3-manifold quantum gravity edit vacuum catastrophe why does the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum have little effect on the expansion of the universe 19 quantum gravity can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory perhaps as a quantum field theory 20 is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself as in loop quantum gravity are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory black holes black hole information paradox and black hole radiation do black holes produce thermal radiation as expected on theoretical grounds 7 does this radiation contain information about their inner structure as suggested by gauge gravity duality or not as implied by hawking s original calculation if not and black holes can evaporate away what happens to the information stored in them since quantum mechanics does not provide for the destruction of information or does the radiation stop at some point leaving black hole remnants is there another way to probe their internal structure somehow if such a structure even exists extra dimensions does nature have more than four spacetime dimensions if so what is their size are dimensions a fundamental property of the universe or an emergent result of other physical laws can we experimentally observe evidence of higher spatial dimensions the cosmic censorship hypothesis and the chronology protection conjecture can singularities not hidden behind an event horizon known as naked singularities arise from realistic initial conditions or is it possible to prove some version of the cosmic censorship hypothesis of roger penrose which proposes that this is impossible 21 similarly will the closed timelike curves which arise in some solutions to the equations of general relativity and which imply the possibility of backwards time travel be ruled out by a theory of quantum gravity which unites general relativity with quantum mechanics as suggested by the chronology protection conjecture of stephen hawking locality are there non-local phenomena in quantum physics 22 23 if they exist are non-local phenomena limited to the entanglement revealed in the violations of the bell inequalities or can information and conserved quantities also move in a non-local way under what circumstances are non-local phenomena observed what does the existence or absence of non-local phenomena imply about the fundamental structure of spacetime how does this relate to quantum entanglement how does this elucidate the proper interpretation of the fundamental nature of quantum physics high-energy physics particle physics edit hierarchy problem why is gravity such a weak force it becomes strong for particles only at the planck scale around 1019 gev much above the electroweak scale 100 gev the energy scale dominating physics at low energies why are these scales so different from each other what prevents quantities at the electroweak scale such as the higgs boson mass from getting quantum corrections on the order of the planck scale is the solution supersymmetry extra dimensions or just anthropic fine-tuning planck particle the planck mass plays an important role in parts of mathematical physics a series of researchers have suggested the existence of a fundamental particle with mass equal to or close to that of the planck mass the planck mass is however enormous compared to any detected particle even compared to the higgs particle it is still an unsolved problem if there exist or even have existed a particle with close to the planck mass this is indirectly related to the hierarchy problem magnetic monopoles did particles that carry magnetic charge exist in some past higher-energy epoch if so do any remain today paul dirac showed the existence of some types of magnetic monopoles would explain charge quantization 24 proton decay and spin crisis is the proton fundamentally stable or does it decay with a finite lifetime as predicted by some extensions to the standard model 25 how do the quarks and gluons carry the spin of protons 26 supersymmetry is spacetime supersymmetry realized at tev scale if so what is the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking does supersymmetry stabilize the electroweak scale preventing high quantum corrections does the lightest supersymmetric particle lsp or lightest supersymmetric particle comprise dark matter generations of matter why are there three generations of quarks and leptons is there a theory that can explain the masses of particular quarks and leptons in particular generations from first principles a theory of yukawa couplings 27 neutrino mass what is the mass of neutrinos whether they follow dirac or majorana statistics is the mass hierarchy normal or inverted is the cp violating phase equal to 0 28 29 colour confinement why has there never been measured a free quark or gluon but only objects that are built out of them such as mesons and baryons how does this phenomenon emerge from qcd strong cp problem and axions why is the strong nuclear interaction invariant to parity and charge conjugation is peccei quinn theory the solution to this problem could axions be the main component of dark matter anomalous magnetic dipole moment why is the experimentally measured value of the muon s anomalous magnetic dipole moment muon g 2 significantly different from the theoretically predicted value of that physical constant 30 proton radius puzzle what is the electric charge radius of the proton how does it differ from gluonic charge pentaquarks and other exotic hadrons what combinations of quarks are possible why were pentaquarks so difficult to discover 31 are they a tightly-bound system of five elementary particles or a more weakly-bound pairing of a baryon and a meson 32 mu problem problem of supersymmetric theories concerned with understanding the parameters of the theory koide formula an aspect of the problem of particle generations the sum of the masses of the three charged leptons divided by the square of the sum of the roots of these masses is q 2 3 textstyle q frac 2 3 to within one standard deviation of observations it is unknown how such a simple value comes about and why it is the exact arithmetic average of the possible extreme values of 1 3 equal masses and 1 one mass dominates astronomy and astrophysics edit astrophysical jet why do only certain accretion discs surrounding certain astronomical objects emit relativistic jets along their polar axes why are there quasi-periodic oscillations in many accretion discs 33 why does the period of these oscillations scale as the inverse of the mass of the central object 34 why are there sometimes overtones and why do these appear at different frequency ratios in different objects 35 diffuse interstellar bands what is responsible for the numerous interstellar absorption lines detected in astronomical spectra are they molecular in origin and if so which molecules are responsible for them how do they form supermassive black holes what is the origin of the m-sigma relation between supermassive black hole mass and galaxy velocity dispersion 36 how did the most distant quasars grow their supermassive black holes up to 1010 solar masses so early in the history of the universe rotation curve of a typical spiral galaxy predicted a and observed b can the discrepancy between the curves be attributed to dark matter kuiper cliff why does the number of objects in the solar system s kuiper belt fall off rapidly and unexpectedly beyond a radius of 50 astronomical units flyby anomaly why is the observed energy of satellites flying by earth sometimes different by a minute amount from the value predicted by theory galaxy rotation problem is dark matter responsible for differences in observed and theoretical speed of stars revolving around the centre of galaxies or is it something else supernovae what is the exact mechanism by which an implosion of a dying star becomes an explosion p-nuclei what astrophysical process is responsible for the nucleogenesis of these rare isotopes ultra-high-energy cosmic ray 17 why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess energies that are impossibly high given that there are no sufficiently energetic cosmic ray sources near the earth why is it that apparently some cosmic rays emitted by distant sources have energies above the greisen zatsepin kuzmin limit 4 17 rotation rate of saturn why does the magnetosphere of saturn exhibit a slowly changing periodicity close to that at which the planet s clouds rotate what is the true rotation rate of saturn s deep interior 37

assumption the number count and intensity dipole anisotropy in radio nrao vla sky survey nvss catalogue 38 is inconsistent with the local motion as derived from cosmic microwave background 39 40 and indicate an intrinsic dipole anisotropy the same nvss radio data also shows an intrinsic dipole in polarization density and degree of polarization 41 in the same direction as in number count and intensity there are other several observation revealing large-scale anisotropy the optical polarization from quasars shows polarization alignment over a very large scale of gpc 42 43 44 the

the source of space roar age metallicity relation in the galactic disk is there a universal age metallicity relation amr in the galactic disk both thin and thick parts of the disk although in the local primarily thin disk of the milky way there is no evidence of a strong amr 49 a sample of 229 nearby thick disk stars has been used to investigate the existence of an age metallicity relation in the galactic thick disk and indicate that there is an age metallicity relation present in the thick disk 50 51 stellar ages from asteroseismology confirm the lack of any strong age-metallicity relation in the galactic disc 52 the lithium problem why is there a discrepancy between the amount of lithium-7 predicted to be produced in big bang nucleosynthesis and the amount observed in very old stars 53 ultraluminous pulsar the ultraluminous x-ray source m82 x-2 was thought to be a black hole but in october 2014 data from nasa s space-based x-ray telescope nustar indicated that m82 x-2 is a

baryon problem 1998 80 -2017 proclaimed solved in october 2017 with the missing baryons located in hot intergalactic gas 81 existence of time crystals 2012 2016 in 2016 the idea of time-crystals was proposed by two groups independently khemani et al 82 and else et al 83 both of these groups showed that in small systems which are disordered and periodic in time one can observe the phenomenon of time crystals norman yao et al extended the calculations for a model which has the same qualitative features in the laboratory environment this was then used by two teams a group led by christopher monroe at the university of maryland and a group led by mikhail lukin at harvard university who were both able to show evidence for time crystals in the lab-setting showing that for short times the systems exhibited the dynamics similar to the predicted one 84 85 existence of gravitational waves 1916 2016 on 11 february 2016 the advanced ligo team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging 86 87 88 which was also the first detection of a stellar binary black hole perform a loophole-free bell test experiment 1970 89 2015 in october 2015 scientists from the kavli institute of nanoscience reported that the failure of the local hidden-variable hypothesis is supported at the 96 confidence level based on a loophole-free bell test study 90 91 these results were confirmed by two studies with statistical significance over 5 standard deviations which were published in december 2015 92 93 existence of pentaquarks 1964 2015 in july 2015 the lhcb collaboration at cern identified pentaquarks in the 0 b j k p channel which represents the decay of the bottom lambda baryon 0 b into a j meson j a kaon k and a proton p the results showed that sometimes instead of decaying directly into mesons and baryons the 0 b decayed via intermediate pentaquark states the two states named p c 4380 and p c 4450 had individual statistical significances of 9 and 12 respectively and a combined significance of 15 enough to claim a formal discovery the two pentaquark states were both observed decaying strongly to j p hence must have a valence quark content of two up quarks a down quark a charm quark and an anti-charm quark u u d c c making them charmonium-pentaquarks 94 photon underproduction crisis 2014 2015 this problem was

crisis existence of ball lightning 1638 96 2014 in january 2014 scientists from northwest normal university in lanzhou china published the results of recordings made in july 2012 of the optical spectrum of what was thought to be natural ball lightning made during the study of ordinary cloud ground lightning on china s qinghai plateau 97 98 at a distance of 900 m 3,000 ft a total of 1.3 seconds of digital video of the ball lightning and its spectrum was made from the formation of the ball lightning after the ordinary lightning struck the ground up to the optical decay of the phenomenon the recorded ball lightning is believed to be vaporized soil elements that then rapidly oxidize in the atmosphere the nature of the true theory is still not clear 98 higgs boson and electroweak symmetry breaking 1963 99 2012 the mechanism responsible for breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry giving mass to the w and z bosons was solved with the discovery of the higgs boson of

precision parallax collecting satellite hipparcos measured the parallax of the pleiades and determined a distance of 385 light years this was significantly different from other measurements made by means of actual to apparent brightness measurement or absolute magnitude the anomaly was due to the use of a weighted mean when there is a correlation between distances and distance errors for stars in clusters it is resolved by using an unweighted mean there is no systematic bias in the hipparcos data when it comes to star clusters 101 faster-than-light neutrino anomaly 2011 2012 in 2011 the opera experiment mistakenly observed neutrinos appearing to travel faster than light on july 12 2012 opera updated their paper by including the new sources of errors in their calculations they found agreement of neutrino speed with the speed of light 102 pioneer anomaly 1980 2012 there was a deviation in the predicted accelerations of the pioneer spacecraft as they left the solar system 4 17 it is believed that this is a result of previously unaccounted-for thermal recoil force 103 104 numerical solution for binary black hole 1960s 2005 the numerical solution of the two body problem in

estimates of the ages of the oldest stars in the milky way better estimates for the distances to the stars and the recognition of the accelerating expansion of the universe reconciled the age estimates nature of quasars 1950s-1980s the nature of quasars was not understood for decades 108 they are now accepted as a type of active galaxy where the enormous energy output results from matter
