photic retinopathy - wikipedia photic retinopathy from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from solar retinopathy jump to navigation search photic retinopathy specialty neurology edit on wikidata photic retinopathy also known as foveomacular retinitis or solar retinopathy is damage to the eye s retina particularly the macula from prolonged exposure to solar radiation or other bright light e g lasers or arc welders the term includes solar laser and welder s retinopathy and is synonymous with retinal phototoxicity 1 it usually occurs due to staring at the sun watching a solar eclipse or viewing an ultraviolet illuminant d65 or other bright light 1 contents 1 signs and symptoms 2 pathophysiology 3 diagnosis 4 treatment 5 prognosis 6 see also 7 references signs and symptoms edit long-term reduced eyesight 2 3 central or paracentral scotoma 2 3 vision loss due to solar retinopathy is typically reversible 4 lasting for as short as one month 2 to over one year 3 the fundus changes are variable and usually bilateral mild cases often show no alteration and moderate to severe cases show a foveal yellow spot on the first days after exposure after a few days it is replaced by a reddish dot often surrounded by pigment permanent holes and lesions are possible prognosis worsens with dilated pupils or prolonged exposure pathophysiology edit although it is frequently claimed that the retina is burned by looking at the sun retinal damage appears to occur primarily due to photochemical injury rather than thermal injury the temperature rise from looking at the sun with a 3-mm pupil only causes a 4 c increase in temperature insufficient to photocoagulate the energy is still phototoxic since light promotes oxidation chemical reactions occur in the exposed tissues with unbonded oxygen molecules 1 it also appears that central serous retinopathy can be a result of a depression in a treated solar damaged eye 4 5 6 the duration of exposure necessary to cause injury varies with the intensity of light and also affects the possibility and length of recovery diagnosis edit a person with photic retinopathy may notice an impairment in their vision for example a spot that does not go away after a reasonable recovery time or blurring they may also have eye pain or headaches vision impairment is usually in both eyes but can be in just one impairment of a person with 20 20 vision usually ends up being about 20 40 or 20 60 but can be better or far worse 7 a doctor examining an eye with retinopathy may be able to see no signs at all or a slight macular edema which is a sort of blister on or under the macula an oval colored spot normally visible to an eye doctor on each person s retina but while even that edema goes away within a few days the patient will generally develop a discoloration of the retina at the injured point often yellow or white turning red over the next few weeks treatment edit photic retinopathy generally goes away on its own over time but there is no specific treatment known to be reliable for speeding recovery one path sometimes attempted which has unclear results is to treat the initial macular edema with corticosteroids 7 prognosis edit generally speaking people diagnosed with photic retinopathy recover visual acuity completely within two months 7 8 though more severe cases may take longer or not see complete recovery at all see also edit retinopathy references edit a b mainster martin a turner patricia l 2006 retinal injuries from light mechanisms hazards and prevention retina 4 ed elsevier mosby pp 1857-70 a b c sefic-kasumovic s firdus h alimanovic e ljaljevic s sefic m eye injuries caused by an eclipse of the sun med arh 2000 54 1 41-4 pmid a b c kallmark fp ygge j photo-induced foveal injury after viewing a solar eclipse acta ophthalmol scand 2005 oct 83 5 586-9 pmid a b chen jc lee lr clin exp optom 2004 nov 87 6 390-3 doi pmid dobson r bmj 1999 aug 21 319 7208 469 pmid hunyor ab solar retinopathy its significance for the ageing eye and the younger pseudophakic patient aust n z j ophthalmol 1987 nov 15 4 371-5 pmid a b c 7 stokkermans tj dunbar mt solar retinopathy in a hospital-based primary care clinic j am optom assoc 1998 oct 69 10 625-36 pmid retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title photic retinopathy oldid 814442914 categories diseases of the eye and adnexa ophthalmology hidden categories infobox medical condition new navigation menu search this page was last edited on 8 december 2017 at 21 26 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
