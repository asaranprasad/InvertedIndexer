the south represents the jastorf culture of the north german plain proto-germanic abbreviated pgmc german urgermanisch also called common germanic german gemeingermanisch is the reconstructed proto-language of the germanic branch of the indo-european languages proto-germanic developed from pre-proto-germanic into three branches during the first half of the first millennium of the common era west germanic east germanic and north germanic which however remained in contact over a considerable time especially the ingvaeonic languages including english which arose from west germanic dialects and remained in continued contact with north germanic a defining feature of proto-germanic is the completion of grimm s law a set of sound changes that occurred between its status as a dialect of proto-indo-european and its gradual divergence into a separate language as it is probable that the development of this sound shift spanned a considerable time several centuries proto-germanic cannot adequately be reconstructed as a simple node in a tree model but rather represents a phase of development that may span close to a thousand years the end of the common germanic period is reached with the beginning of the migration period in the fourth century the alternative term germanic parent language may be used to include a larger scope of linguistic developments spanning the nordic bronze age and pre-roman iron age in northern europe second to first millennia bc to include pre-germanic pregmc early proto germanic epgmc and late proto-germanic lpgmc 1 while proto-germanic refers only to the most recent reconstruction of the common ancestor of germanic languages the germanic parent language refers to the entire journey that the dialect of proto-indo-european that would become proto-germanic underwent through the millennia the proto-germanic language is not directly attested by any coherent surviving texts it has been reconstructed using the comparative method fragmentary direct attestation exists of late common germanic in early runic inscriptions specifically the second-century ad vimose inscriptions and the second-century bc

substrate hypothesis it may be influenced by non-indo-european cultures such as the funnelbeaker culture but the sound change in the germanic languages known as grimm s law points to a non-substratic

reconstructed proto-germanic but other common innovations separating germanic from proto-indo-european suggest a common history of pre-proto-germanic speakers throughout the nordic bronze age early

by the 3rd century lpgmc speakers had expanded over significant distance from the rhine to the dniepr spanning about 1,200 km 700 mi the period marks the breakup of late proto-germanic and the beginning of the historiographically-recorded germanic migrations the first coherent text recorded in a germanic language is the gothic bible written in the later 4th century in the language of the thervingi gothic christians who had escaped persecution by moving from scythia to moesia in 348 the earliest available coherent texts conveying complete sentences including verbs in proto-norse begin in c 400 in runic inscriptions such as the tune runestone the delineation of late common germanic from proto-norse at about that time is largely a matter of convention early west germanic text is available from the 5th century beginning with the frankish bergakker inscription evolution edit the evolution of proto-germanic from its ancestral forms beginning with its ancestor proto-indo-european began with the development of a separate common way of speech among some geographically nearby speakers of a prior language and ended with the dispersion of the proto-language speakers into distinct populations with mostly independent speech habits between the two points many sound changes occurred theories of phylogeny edit solutions edit phylogeny as applied to historical linguistics involves the evolutionary descent of languages the phylogeny problem is the question of what specific tree in the tree model of language evolution best explains the paths of descent of all the members of a language family from a common language or proto-language at the root of the tree to the attested languages at the leaves of the tree the germanic languages form a tree with proto-germanic at its root that is a branch of the indo-european tree which in turn has proto-indo-european at its root borrowing of lexical items from contact languages makes the relative position of the germanic branch within indo-european less clear than the positions of the other branches of indo-european in the course of the development of historical linguistics various solutions have been proposed none certain and all debatable in the evolutionary history of a language family philologists consider a genetic tree model appropriate only if communities do not remain in effective contact as their languages diverge early indo-european had limited contact between distinct lineages and uniquely the germanic subfamily exhibited a less treelike behaviour as some of its characteristics were acquired from neighbours early in its evolution rather than from its direct ancestors the internal diversification of west germanic developed in an especially non-treelike manner 11 proto-germanic is generally agreed to have begun about 500 bc 12 its hypothetical ancestor between the end of proto-indo-european and 500 bc is termed pre-proto-germanic whether it is to be included under a wider meaning of proto-germanic is a matter of usage winfred p lehmann regarded jacob grimm s first germanic sound shift or grimm s law and verner s law 13 which pertained mainly to consonants and were considered for many decades to have generated proto-germanic as pre-proto-germanic and held that the upper boundary was the fixing of the accent or stress on the root syllable of a word typically on the first syllable 14 proto-indo-european had featured a moveable pitch-accent comprising an alternation of high and low tones 15 as well as stress of position determined by a set of rules based on the lengths of a word s syllables the fixation of the stress led to sound changes in unstressed syllables for lehmann the lower boundary was the dropping of final -a or -e in unstressed syllables for example post-pie w yd-e gothic wait knows antonsen agreed with lehmann about the upper boundary 16 but later found runic evidence that the -a was not dropped kwakraz wraita i wakraz wrote this he says we must therefore search for a new lower boundary for proto-germanic 17 antonsen s own scheme divides proto-germanic into an early stage and a late stage the early stage includes the stress fixation and resulting spontaneous vowel-shifts while the late stage is defined by ten complex rules governing changes of both vowels and consonants 18 by 250 bc proto-germanic had branched into five groups of germanic two each in the west and the north and one in the east 4 phonological stages from proto-indo-european to end of proto-germanic edit the following changes are known or presumed to have occurred in the history of proto-germanic in the wider sense from the end of proto-indo-european up to the point that proto-germanic began to break into mutually unintelligible dialects the changes are listed roughly in chronological order with changes that operate on the outcome of earlier ones appearing later in the list the stages distinguished and the changes associated with each stage rely heavily on ringe 2006 chapter 3 the development of proto-germanic ringe in turn summarizes standard concepts and terminology pre-proto-germanic pre-pgmc edit this stage began with the separation of a distinct speech perhaps while it was still forming part of the proto-indo-european dialect continuum it contained many innovations that were shared with other indo-european branches to various degrees probably

laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels as well as one or two overlong vowels the consonant system was still that of pie minus palatovelars and laryngeals but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from pie proper mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of pie but it would have been strained and the period marked the definitive break of germanic from the other indo-european languages and the beginning of germanic proper containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively this

by this stage germanic had emerged as a distinctive branch and had undergone many of the sound changes that would make its later descendants recognisable as germanic languages it had shifted its consonant inventory from a system that was rich in plosives to one containing primarily fricatives had lost the pie mobile pitch accent for a predictable stress accent and had merged two of its vowels the stress accent had already begun to cause the erosion of unstressed syllables which would continue in its descendants the final stage of the language included the remaining development until the

into proto-germanic from other known languages or from proto-germanic into other languages can be dated relative to each other by which germanic sound laws have acted on them since the dates of borrowings and sound laws are not precisely known it is not possible to use loans to establish absolute or calendar chronology loans from adjoining indo-european groups edit most loans from celtic appear to have been made before or during the germanic sound shift 20 for instance one specimen r ks ruler was borrowed from celtic r xs king stem r g- with g k 21 it is clearly not native because pie

known in the non-germanic languages spoken in areas adjacent to the germanic languages the heaviest influence has been on the finnic languages which have received hundreds of proto-germanic or

finn kuningas 2 lambaz lamb compare finn lammas 30 lunaz ransom compare finn lunnas 31 loanwords into the samic languages baltic languages and slavic languages are also known non-indo-european substrate elements edit the term substrate with reference to proto-germanic refers to lexical items and phonological elements that do not appear to be descended from proto-indo-european the substrate theory postulates that the elements came from an earlier population that stayed amongst the indo-europeans and was influential enough to bring over some elements of its own language the theory of a non-indo-european substrate was first proposed by sigmund feist who estimated that about a third of all proto-germanic lexical items came from the substrate note 2 theo vennemann has hypothesized a basque substrate and a semitic superstrate in germanic however his speculations too are generally rejected by specialists in the relevant fields 32 research in germanic etymology continues and many germanic words whose origins were previously unclear or controversial now have plausible explanations in terms of reconstructed indo-european words and morphology thus the proportion of germanic words without any plausible etymological explanation has decreased over time estimates of that proportion are typically outdated or inflated as many of these proposals were unknown when scholars were compiling lists of unexplained germanic words citation needed phonology edit transcription edit the following conventions are used in this article for transcribing proto-germanic reconstructed forms voiced obstruents appear as b d g this does not imply any particular analysis of the underlying phonemes as plosives b d or fricatives in other literature they may be written as graphemes with a bar to produce unvoiced fricatives appear as f h perhaps x x may have become h in certain positions at a later stage of proto-germanic itself similarly for x which later became h or in some environments labiovelars appear as kw hw gw this does not imply any particular analysis as single sounds e g k x or clusters e g kw xw w the yod sound appears as j j note that the normal convention for representing this sound in proto-indo-european is y the use of j does not imply any actual change in the pronunciation of the sound long vowels are denoted with a macron over the letter e g when a distinction is necessary and e are transcribed as and respectively is sometimes transcribed as or instead but this is not followed here overlong vowels appear with circumflexes e g in other literature they are often denoted by a doubled macron e g nasal vowels are written here with an ogonek following don ringe s usage e g most commonly in literature they are denoted simply by a following n however this can cause confusion between a word-final nasal vowel and a word-final regular vowel followed by n a distinction which was phonemic tildes are also used in some sources diphthongs appear as ai au eu iu i u and perhaps i u 33 however when immediately followed by the corresponding semivowel they appear as ajj aww eww iww u is written as w when between a vowel and j this convention is based on the usage in ringe 2006 long vowels followed by a non-high vowel were separate syllables and are written as such here except for which is written ij in that case consonants edit the table below 4 lists the consonantal phonemes of proto-germanic classified by their reconstructed pronunciation the slashes around the phonemes are omitted for clarity when two phonemes appear in the same box the first of each pair is voiceless the second is voiced phones written in parentheses represent allophones and are not independent phonemes for descriptions of the sounds and definitions of the terms

r notes was an allophone of n before velar obstruents was an allophone of n before labiovelar obstruents and were allophones of b d and in certain positions see below the phoneme written as f was probably still realised as a bilabial fricative in proto-germanic evidence for this is the fact that in gothic word-final b which medially represents a voiced fricative devoices to f and also old norse spellings such as aptr tr where the letter p rather than the more usual f was used to denote the bilabial realisation before t grimm s and verner s law edit grimm s law as applied to pre-proto-germanic is a chain shift of the original indo-european plosives verner s law explains a category of exceptions to grimm s law where a voiced fricative appears where grimm s law predicts a voiceless fricative the discrepancy is conditioned by the placement of the original indo-european word accent labiovelar reduction near u grimm s law voiceless to fricative grimm s law voiced to voiceless grimm s law aspirated to voiced verner s law labiovelar dissolution labials p b p b b b dentals t d t d d d velars k x k x labiovelars k k k x k x b w p t and k did not undergo grimm s law after a fricative such as s or after other plosives which were shifted to fricatives by the germanic spirant law for example where latin with the original t has stella star and oct eight middle dutch has ster and acht with unshifted t 34 this original t merged with the shifted t from the voiced consonant that is most of the instances of t came from either the original t or the shifted t a similar shift on the consonant inventory of proto-germanic later generated high german mcmahon says 35 grimm s and verner s laws together form the first germanic consonant shift a second and chronologically later second germanic consonant shift affected only proto-germanic voiceless stops and split germanic into two sets of dialects low german in the north and high german further south verner s law is usually reconstructed as following grimm s law in time and states that unvoiced fricatives s x are voiced when preceded by an unaccented syllable the accent at the time of the change was the one inherited from proto-indo-european which was free and could occur on any syllable for example pie b r h t r pgmc br r brother but pie meh t r pgmc m d r mother the voicing of some s according to verner s law produced z a new phoneme 4 sometime after grimm s and verner s law proto-germanic lost its inherited contrastive accent and all words became stressed on their root syllable this was generally the first syllable unless a prefix was attached the loss of the proto-indo-european contrastive accent got rid of the conditioning environment for the consonant alternations created by verner s law without this conditioning environment the cause of the alternation was no longer obvious to native speakers the alternations that had started as mere phonetic variants of sounds became increasingly grammatical in nature leading to the grammatical alternations of sounds known as grammatischer wechsel for a single word the grammatical stem could display different consonants depending on its grammatical case or its tense as a result of the complexity of this system significant levelling of these sounds occurred throughout the germanic period as well as in the later daughter languages already in proto-germanic most alternations in nouns were leveled to have only one sound or the other consistently throughout all forms of a word although some alternations were preserved only to be levelled later in the daughters but differently in each one alternations in noun and verb endings were also levelled usually in favour of the voiced alternants in nouns but a split remained in verbs where unsuffixed strong verbs received the voiced alternants while suffixed weak verbs had the voiceless alternants alternation between the present and past of strong verbs remained common and was not levelled in proto-germanic and survives up to the present day in some germanic languages allophones edit some of the consonants that developed from the sound shifts are thought to have been pronounced in different ways allophones depending on the sounds around them with regard to original k or k trask says 36 the resulting x or x were reduced to h and h in word-initial position many of the consonants listed in the table could appear lengthened or prolonged under some circumstances which is inferred from their appearing in some daughter languages as doubled letters this phenomenon is termed gemination kraehenmann says 37 then proto-germanic already had long consonants but they contrasted with short ones only word-medially moreover they were not very frequent and occurred only intervocally almost exclusively after short vowels the voiced phonemes b d and are reconstructed with the pronunciation of stops in some environments and fricatives in others the pattern of allophony is not completely clear but generally is similar to the patterns of voiced obstruent allophones in languages such as spanish 38 the voiced fricatives of verner s law see above which only occurred in non-word-initial positions merged with the fricative allophones of b d and older accounts tended to suggest that the sounds were originally fricatives and later hardened into stops in some circumstances however ringe notes that this belief was largely due to theory-internal considerations of older phonological theories and in modern theories it is equally possible that the allophony was present from the beginning 39 each of the three voiced phonemes b d and had a slightly different pattern of allophony from the others but in general stops occurred in strong positions word-initial and in clusters while fricatives occurred in weak positions post-vocalic more specifically word-initial b and d were stops b and d a good deal of evidence however indicates that word-initial was

environment in which a labiovelar occurred near a u it was immediately converted to a plain velar this caused certain alternations in verb paradigms such as singwan si n to sing versus sungun su un

is distinct from the consonant mutation processes occurring in the neighboring samic and finnic languages also known as consonant gradation since the 19th century the proto-germanic consonant gradation is not directly attested in any of the germanic dialects but may nevertheless be reconstructed on the basis of certain dialectal discrepancies in root of the n-stems and the n-verbs diachronically the rise of consonant gradation in germanic can be explained by kluge s law by which geminates arose from stops followed by a nasal in a stressed syllable since this sound law only operated in part of the paradigms of the n-stems and n-verbs it gave rise to an alternation of geminated and non-geminated consonants however there has been controversy about the validity of this law with some linguists preferring to explain the development of geminate consonants with the idea of expressive gemination the origin of the germanic geminate consonants is currently a disputed part of

vowels probably were and or perhaps and their timbres then differentiated by raising and perhaps rounding the long vowel to citation needed it is known that the raising of to can not have occurred earlier than the earliest contact between proto-germanic speakers and the romans this can be verified by the fact that latin r m n later emerges in gothic as rumoneis that is r m n s it is explained by ringe that at the time of borrowing the vowel matching closest in sound to latin was a proto-germanic -like vowel which later became and since proto-germanic therefore lacked a mid -high back vowel the closest equivalent of latin was proto-germanic r m n r m n z r m n z gothic rumoneis a new was formed following the shift from to when intervocalic j was lost in -aja- sequences it was a rare

proto-indo-european this explains why j was not lost in niwjaz new the second element of the diphthong iu was still underlyingly a consonant and therefore the conditioning environment for the loss was not met this is also confirmed by the fact that later in the west germanic gemination -wj- is geminated to -wwj- in parallel with the other consonants except r overlong vowels edit proto-germanic had two overlong or trimoraic long vowels and the latter mainly in adverbs cf hwadr whereto whither 43 none of the documented languages still include such vowels their reconstruction is due to the comparative method particularly as a way of explaining an otherwise unpredictable two-way split of reconstructed long in final syllables which unexpectedly remained long in some morphemes but shows normal shortening in others proto-germanic gothic old norse old high german old english - -a -u -u -u - - -a -o -a trimoraic vowels generally occurred at morpheme boundaries where a bimoraic long

between vowels so that - ja a cf salb jan salb n gothic salb n to anoint however the majority occurred in word-final syllables inflectional endings probably because in this position the vowel could

vowels remained long vowels while bimoraic vowels developed into short vowels older theories about the phenomenon claimed that long and overlong vowels were both long but differed in tone i e and had a circumflex rise-fall-rise tone while and had an acute rising tone much like the tones of modern scandinavian languages 46 baltic and ancient greek and asserted that this distinction was inherited from pie however this view was abandoned since languages in general do not combine distinctive intonations on unstressed syllables with contrastive stress and vowel length 47 modern theories have reinterpreted overlong vowels as having superheavy syllable weight three moras and therefore greater length than ordinary long vowels by the end of the proto-germanic period word-final long vowels were shortened to short vowels following that overlong vowels were shortened to regular long vowels in all positions merging with originally long vowels except word-finally because of the earlier shortening so that they remained distinct in that position this was a late dialectal development because the end result was not the same in all germanic languages word-final shortened to a in east and west germanic but to i in old norse and word-final shortened to a in gothic but to o probably o in early north and west germanic with a later raising to u the 6th century salic law still has maltho in late frankish the shortened overlong vowels in final position developed as regular long vowels from that point on including the lowering of to in north and west germanic the monophthongization of unstressed au in northwest germanic produced a phoneme which merged with this new word-final long while the monophthongization of unstressed ai produced a new which did not merge with original but rather with as it was not lowered to this split combined with the asymmetric development in west germanic with lowering but raising points to an early difference in the articulation height of the two vowels that was not present in north germanic it could be seen as evidence that the lowering of to began in west germanic at a time when final vowels were still long and spread to north germanic through the late germanic dialect continuum but only reaching the latter after the vowels had already been shortened and edit is uncertain as a phoneme and only reconstructed from a small number of words it is posited by the comparative method because whereas all provable instances of inherited pie pgmc are distributed in gothic as and the other germanic languages as 48 all the germanic languages agree on some occasions of e g goth oe on h r here late pgmc h r gothic makes no orthographic and therefore presumably no phonetic distinction between and but the existence of two

from pie -n or -m in unstressed syllables which at first gave rise to short - - - long - - - and overlong - - - and - then merged into - and - which later developed into - and - another source developing only in late proto-germanic times was in the sequences -inh- -anh- -unh- in which the nasal consonant lost its occlusion and was converted into lengthening and nasalisation of the preceding vowel becoming - h- - h- - h- still written as -anh- -inh- -unh- in this article in many cases the nasality was not contrastive and was merely present as an additional surface articulation no germanic language that preserves the word-final vowels has their nasality preserved word-final short nasal vowels do not show different reflexes compared to non-nasal vowels however the comparative method does require a three-way phonemic distinction between word-final - - and - n which each has a distinct pattern of reflexes in the later germanic languages proto-germanic gothic old norse old high german old english - -a -u -u -u - -a -a -a -e - n - n -a -u - n -an the distinct reflexes of nasal - versus non-nasal - are caused by the northwest germanic raising of final - to o which did not affect - when the vowels were shortened and denasalised these two vowels no longer had the same place of articulation and did not merge - became o later u while - became later this allowed their reflexes to stay distinct the nasality of word-internal vowels from -nh- was more stable and survived into the early dialects intact phonemic nasal vowels definitely occurred in proto-norse and old norse they were preserved in old icelandic down to at least a d 1125 the earliest possible time for the creation of the first grammatical treatise which documents nasal vowels the pg nasal vowels from -nh- sequences were preserved in old icelandic as shown by examples given in the first grammatical treatise for example h r shark h haz pg hanhaz ra younger j hiz pg junhiz cf gothic j hiza the phonemicity

vowels were inherited but were joined by new nasal vowels resulting from the ingvaeonic nasal spirant law which extended the loss of nasal consonants only before -h- in proto-germanic to all environments before a fricative thus including -mf- -n - and -ns- as well the contrast between nasal and non-nasal long vowels is reflected in the differing output of nasalized long which was raised

unstressed syllables vowels in third syllables were also generally lost before dialect diversification began such as final -i of some present tense verb endings and in -maz and -miz of the dative plural ending and 1st person plural present of verbs word-final short nasal vowels were however preserved longer as is reflected proto-norse which still preserved word-final - horna on the gallehus horns while the dative plural appears as -mz gestumz on the stentoften runestone somewhat greater reduction is found in gothic which lost all final-syllable short vowels except u old high german and old english initially preserved unstressed i and u but later lost them in long-stemmed words and then old high german lost them in many short-stemmed ones as well by analogy old english shows indirect evidence that word-final - was preserved into the separate history of the language this can be seen in the infinitive ending -an an and the strong past participle ending -en -anaz since the early old english fronting of to did not occur in nasalized vowels or before back vowels this created a vowel alternation because the nasality of the back vowel in the infinitive ending prevented the fronting of the preceding vowel -an -an but -anaz - n -en therefore the anglo-frisian brightening must necessarily have occurred very early in the history of the anglo-frisian languages before the loss of

asterisk it is often asserted that the germanic languages have a highly reduced system of inflections as compared with greek latin or sanskrit although this is true to some extent it is probably due more to the late time of attestation of germanic than to any inherent simplicity of the germanic languages as an example there are less than 500 years between the gothic gospels of 360 and the old high germanic tatian of 830 yet old high germanic despite being the most archaic of the west germanic languages is missing a large number of archaic features present in gothic including dual and passive markings on verbs reduplication in class vii strong verb past tenses the vocative case and second-position wackernagel s law clitics many more archaic features may have been lost between the proto-germanic of 200 bc or so and the attested gothic language furthermore proto-romance and middle indic of the fourth century ad contemporaneous with gothic were significantly simpler than latin and sanskrit respectively and overall probably no more archaic than gothic in addition some parts of the inflectional systems of greek latin and sanskrit were innovations that were not present in proto-indo-european general morphological features edit proto-germanic had six cases three genders three numbers three moods indicative subjunctive pie optative imperative and two voices active and passive pie middle this is quite similar to the state of latin greek and middle indic of c ad 200 nouns and adjectives were declined in at least six cases vocative nominative accusative dative instrumental genitive the locative case had merged into the dative case and the ablative may have merged with either the genitive dative or instrumental cases however sparse remnants of the earlier locative and ablative cases are visible in a few pronominal and adverbial forms pronouns were declined similarly although without a separate vocative form the instrumental and vocative can be reconstructed only in the singular the instrumental survives only in the west germanic languages and the vocative only in gothic verbs and pronouns had three numbers singular dual and plural although the pronominal dual survived into all the oldest languages the verbal dual survived only into gothic and the presumed nominal and adjectival dual forms were lost before the oldest records as in the italic languages it may have been lost before proto-germanic became a different branch at all consonant and vowel alternations edit several sound changes occurred in the history of proto-germanic that were triggered only in some environments but not in others some of these were grammaticalised while others were still triggered by phonetic rules and were partially allophonic or surface filters probably the most far-reaching alternation was between f s h hw and b d z g gw the voiceless and voiced fricatives known as grammatischer wechsel and triggered by the earlier operation of verner s law it was found in various environments in the person-and-number endings of verbs which were voiceless in weak verbs and voiced in strong verbs between different grades of strong verbs the voiceless alternants appeared in the present and past singular indicative the voiced alternants in the remaining past tense forms between strong verbs voiceless and causative verbs derived from them voiced between verbs and derived nouns between the singular and plural forms of some nouns another form of alternation was triggered by the germanic spirant law which continued to operate into the separate history of the individual daughter languages it is found in environments with suffixal -t including the second-person singular past ending -t of strong verbs the past tense of weak verbs with no vowel infix in the past tense nouns derived from verbs by means of the suffixes -tiz -tuz -taz which also possessed variants in - - and -d- when not following an obstruent an alternation not triggered by sound change was sievers law which caused alternation of suffixal -j- and -ij- depending on the length of the preceding part of the morpheme if preceded within the same morpheme by only short vowel followed by a single consonant -j- appeared in all other cases such as when preceded by a long vowel or diphthong by two or more consonants or by more than one syllable -ij- appeared the distinction between morphemes and words is important here as the alternant -j- appeared also in words that contained a distinct suffix that in turn contained -j- in its second syllable a notable example was the verb suffix -atjan which retained -j- despite being preceded by two syllables in a fully formed word related to the above was the alternation between -j- and -i- and likewise between -ij- and - - this was caused by the earlier loss of -j- before -i- and appeared whenever an ending was attached to a verb or noun with an - i j- suffix which were numerous similar but much more rare was an alternation between -av- and -aic- from the loss of -j- between two vowels which appeared in the present subjunctive of verbs -a -aj in the first person -ai- in the others a combination of these two effects created an alternation between - - and -ai- found in class 3 weak verbs with - - -aja- - ja- and -ai- - i- - ji- i-mutation was the most important source of vowel alternation and continued well into the history of the individual daughter languages although it was either absent or not apparent in gothic in proto-germanic only -e- was affected which was raised by -i- or -j- in the following syllable examples are numerous verb endings beginning with -i- present second and third person singular third person plural noun endings beginning with -i- in u-stem nouns dative singular nominative and genitive plural causatives derived from strong verbs with a -j- suffix verbs derived from nouns with a -j- suffix nouns derived from verbs with a -j- suffix nouns and adjectives derived with a variety of suffixes including -il- -i - -iskaz -ingaz nouns edit the system of nominal declensions was largely inherited from pie primary nominal declensions were the stems in a n i and u the first three were particularly important and served as the basis of adjectival declension there was a tendency for nouns of all other classes to be drawn into them the first two had variants in ja and wa and j and w respectively originally these were declined exactly like other nouns of the respective class but later sound changes tended to distinguish these variants as their own subclasses the n nouns had various subclasses including n masculine and feminine an neuter and n feminine mostly abstract nouns there was also a smaller class of root nouns ending in various consonants nouns of relationship ending in er and neuter nouns in z this class was greatly expanded in german present participles and a few nouns ended in nd the neuter nouns of all classes differed from the masculines and feminines

the noun they qualify in case number and gender adjectives evolved into strong and weak declensions originally with indefinite and definite meaning respectively as a result of its definite meaning the weak form came to be used in the daughter languages in conjunction with demonstratives and definite articles the terms strong and weak are based on the later development of these declensions in languages such as german and old english where the strong declensions have more distinct endings in the proto-language as in gothic such terms have no relevance the strong declension was based on a combination of the nominal a and stems with the pie pronominal endings the weak declension was based on the nominal n declension case strong declension weak declension masculine feminine neuter

only two tenses past and present compared to 5-7 in greek latin proto-slavic and sanskrit some of this difference is due to deflexion featured by a loss of tenses present in proto-indo-european for example donald ringe assumes for proto-germanic an early loss of the pie imperfect aspect something that also occurred in most other branches followed by merging of the aspectual categories present-aorist and the mood categories indicative-subjunctive this assumption allows him to account for cases where proto-germanic has present indicative verb forms that look like pie aorist subjunctives however many of the tenses of the other languages e g future future perfect pluperfect latin imperfect are not cognate with each other and represent separate innovations in each language for example the greek future uses a -s- ending apparently derived from a desiderative construction that in pie was part of the system of derivational morphology not the inflectional system the sanskrit future uses a -sy- ending from a different desiderative verb construction and often with a different ablaut grade from greek while the latin future uses endings derived either from the pie subjunctive or from the pie verb b u to be similarly the latin imperfect and pluperfect stem from italic innovations and are not cognate with the corresponding greek or sanskrit forms and while the greek and sanskrit pluperfect tenses appear cognate there are no parallels in any other indo-european languages leading to the conclusion that this tense is either a shared greek-sanskrit innovation or separate coincidental developments in the two languages in this respect proto-germanic can be said to be characterized by the failure to innovate new synthetic tenses as much as the loss of existing tenses later germanic languages did innovate new tenses derived through periphrastic constructions with modern english likely possessing the most elaborated tense system yes the house will still be being built a month from now on the other hand even the past tense was later lost or widely lost in most high german dialects as well as in afrikaans verbs in proto-germanic were divided into two main groups called strong and weak according to the way the past tense is formed strong verbs use ablaut i e a different vowel in the stem and or reduplication derived primarily from the proto-indo-european perfect while weak verbs use a dental suffix now generally held to be a reflex of the reduplicated imperfect of pie dheh1- originally put in germanic do strong verbs were divided into seven main classes while weak verbs were divided into five main classes although no attested language has more than four classes of weak verbs strong verbs generally have no suffix in the present tense although some have a -j- suffix that is a direct continuation of the pie -y- suffix and a few have an -n- suffix or infix that continues the -n- infix of pie almost all weak verbs have a present-tense suffix which varies from class to class an additional small but very important group of verbs formed their present tense from the pie perfect and their past tense like weak verbs for this reason they are known as preterite-present verbs all three of the previously mentioned groups of verbs strong weak and preterite-present are derived from pie thematic verbs an additional very small group derives from pie athematic verbs and one verb wiljan to want forms its present indicative from the pie optative mood proto-germanic verbs have three moods indicative subjunctive and imperative the subjunctive mood derives from the pie optative mood indicative and subjunctive moods are fully conjugated throughout the present and past while the imperative mood existed only in the present tense and lacked first-person forms proto-germanic verbs have two voices active and passive the latter deriving from the pie mediopassive voice the proto-germanic passive existed only in the present tense an inherited feature as the pie perfect had no mediopassive on the evidence of gothic the only germanic language with a reflex of the proto-germanic passive the passive voice had a significantly reduced inflectional system with a single form used for all persons of the dual and plural note that although old norse has an inflected mediopassive it is not inherited from proto-germanic but is an innovation formed by attaching the reflexive pronoun to the active voice although most proto-germanic strong verbs are formed directly from a verbal root weak verbs are generally derived from an existing noun verb or adjective so-called denominal deverbal and deadjectival verbs for example a significant subclass of class i weak verbs are deverbal causative verbs these are formed in a way that reflects a direct inheritance from the pie causative class of verbs pie causatives were formed by adding an accented suffix - i e i o to the o-grade of a non-derived verb in proto-germanic causatives are formed by adding a suffix -j ij- the reflex of pie - i e i o to the past-tense ablaut mostly with the reflex of pie o-grade of a strong verb the reflex of pie
