arctic circle - wikipedia arctic circle from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search map of the arctic with the arctic circle in blue and the july 10 c mean isotherm in red timeframe the arctic circle is the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of earth it marks the northernmost point at which the noon sun is just visible on the december solstice and the southernmost point at which the midnight sun is just visible on the june solstice the region north of this circle is known as the arctic and the zone just to the south is called the northern temperate zone as seen from the arctic the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year and therefore visible at midnight and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year and therefore not visible at noon this is also true in the antarctic region south of the equivalent antarctic circle the position of the arctic circle is not fixed as of 28 february 2018 it runs 66 33 47.1 north of the equator 1 its latitude depends on the earth s axial tilt which fluctuates within a margin of 2 over a 40,000-year period due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the moon 2 consequently the arctic circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about 15 metres 49 feet per year contents 1 etymology 2 midnight sun and polar night 3 human habitation 4 geography 4.1 climate 4.2 sites along the arctic circle 5 see also 6 references 7 external links etymology edit the word arctic comes from the greek word arktikos near the bear northern 3 and that from the word arktos bear 4 midnight sun and polar night edit relationship of earth s axial tilt to the tropical and polar circles the arctic circle is the southernmost latitude in the northern hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for twenty-four hours as a result at least once each year at any location within the arctic circle the sun is visible at local midnight and at least once it is not visible at local noon 5 directly on the arctic circle these events occur in principle exactly once per year at the june and december solstices respectively however because of atmospheric refraction and mirages and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50 minutes 90 km 56 mi south of the arctic circle similarly on the day of the northern winter solstice part of the sun may be seen up to about 50 north of the arctic circle that is true at sea level those limits increase with elevation above sea level although in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the true horizon human habitation edit cylindrical projection showing the arctic circle in red only four million people live north of the arctic circle due to the severe climate nonetheless some areas have been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples who today make up 10 of the region s population 6 tens of thousands of years ago waves of people migrated from eastern siberia across the bering strait into north america to settle much later in the historic period there has been migration into some arctic areas by europeans and other immigrants citation needed the largest communities north of the arctic circle are situated in russia and norway murmansk population 307,257 norilsk 175,365 troms 71,295 and vorkuta 59,231 rovaniemi 61,329 in finland is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the arctic circle lying 6 kilometres 4 miles south of the line in contrast the largest north american community north of the arctic circle sisimiut greenland has approximately 5,000 inhabitants of the canadian and united states arctic communities barrow alaska is the largest settlement with about 4,000 inhabitants geography edit map all coordinates using download coordinates as the countries transcending the arctic circle the arctic circle is roughly 16,000 kilometres 9,900 mi 7 the area north of the circle is about 20,000,000 km2 7,700,000 sq mi and covers roughly 4 of earth s surface 8 the arctic circle passes through the arctic ocean the scandinavian peninsula north asia northern america and greenland the land within the arctic circle is divided among 8 countries norway sweden finland russia the united states alaska canada yukon northwest territories and nunavut denmark greenland and iceland where it passes through the small offshore island of gr msey climate edit the climate inside the arctic circle is generally cold but the coastal areas of norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the gulf stream which makes the ports of northern norway and northwest russia ice-free all year long in the interior summers can be quite warm while winters are extremely cold for example summer temperatures in norilsk russia will sometimes reach as high as 30 c 86 f while the winter temperatures frequently fall below 50 c 58 f sites along the arctic circle edit starting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards the arctic circle passes through co-ordinates country territory or
