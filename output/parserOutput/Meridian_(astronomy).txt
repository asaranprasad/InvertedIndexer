meridian astronomy - wikipedia meridian astronomy from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the meridian on the celestial sphere the yellow hemi-disk is bounded above by the upper meridian in astronomy the meridian is the great circle passing through the celestial poles the zenith and the nadir of an observer s location consequently it contains also the horizon s north and south points and it is perpendicular to the celestial equator and horizon a celestial meridian is coplanar with the analogous terrestrial meridian projected onto the celestial sphere hence the number of astronomical meridians is infinite the celestial meridian is undefined when the observer is at the north pole or south pole since at these two points the zenith and nadir are on the celestial poles and any great circle passing through the celestial poles also passes through the zenith and nadir there are several ways to divide the meridian into semicircles one way is to divide it into the local meridian and the antimeridian the former semicircle contains the zenith and is terminated by the celestial poles the latter semicircle contains the nadir in the horizontal coordinate system the meridian is divided into halves terminated by the horizon s north and south points the upper meridian passes through the zenith while the lower meridian passes through the nadir in any given day a celestial object will appear to drift across the upper meridian as the earth rotates for the meridian is fixed to the local horizon at culmination the object contacts the upper meridian and reaches its highest position in the sky an object s right ascension and the local sidereal time can be used to determine the time of its culmination see hour angle the term meridian comes from the latin meridies which means both midday and south see also edit meridian geography prime meridian planets longitude planets references edit millar william 2006 the amateur astronomer s introduction to the celestial sphere cambridge university press this astronomy-related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by v t this cartography or mapping term article is a stub you can help wikipedia by v t retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title meridian astronomy oldid 804039134 categories celestial coordinate system astronomy stubs cartography stubs hidden categories all stub articles navigation menu search this page was last edited on 6 october 2017 at 09 35 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
