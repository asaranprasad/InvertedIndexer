aurora - wikipedia aurora from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from aurora astronomy jump to navigation search images of auroras from around the world including those with rarer red and blue lights aurora australis from the iss 2017 video of this encounter 2 an aurora plural auroras a sometimes referred to as polar lights northern lights aurora borealis or southern lights aurora australis is a natural light display in the earth s sky predominantly seen in the high-latitude regions around the arctic and antarctic auroras are produced when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma mainly in the form of electrons and protons precipitate them into the upper atmosphere thermosphere exosphere due to earth s magnetic field where their energy is lost the resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying color and complexity the form of the aurora occurring within bands around both polar regions is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes 2 contents 1 etymology 2 occurrence of

to be the first light of dawn occurrence of terrestrial auroras edit most auroras occur in a band known as the auroral zone 3 which is typically 3 to 6 wide in latitude and between 10 and 20 from the geomagnetic poles at all local times or longitudes most clearly seen at night against a dark sky a region that currently displays an aurora is called the auroral oval a band displaced towards the night side of the earth 4 early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations elias loomis 1860 and later hermann fritz 1881 5 and s tromholt 1882 6 in more detail established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the internet 7 in northern latitudes the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights the former term was coined by galileo in 1619 from the roman goddess of the dawn and the greek name for the north wind 8 the southern counterpart the aurora australis or the southern lights has features almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone 9 the aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in antarctica chile argentina new zealand and australia a geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals north and south to expand and bring the aurora to lower latitudes it was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole which is about 2000 km away from the magnetic pole the instantaneous distribution of auroras auroral oval 3 is slightly different being centered about 3 5 nightward of the magnetic pole so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the sun the aurora can be seen best at this time which is called magnetic midnight auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead but from farther away they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow or sometimes a faint red as if the sun were rising from an unusual direction auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs 10 which can be subvisual videos of the aurora australis taken by the crew of

pass to the east of new zealand noaa maps of north america and eurasia north america eurasia these maps show the local midnight equatorward boundary of the aurora at different levels of geomagnetic activity a kp 3 corresponds to low levels of geomagnetic activity while kp 9 represents high levels auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak 11 12 an aurora may appear overhead as a corona of rays radiating from a distant and apparent central location which results from perspective an electron spirals gyrates about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors parallel and perpendicular respectively to the local geomagnetic field vector b this angle is known as the pitch angle of the particle the distance or radius of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its larmor radius the pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere thus it is possible for some particles to return or mirror if the angle becomes 90 before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes other types of auroras have been observed from space e g poleward arcs stretching sunward across the polar cap the related theta aurora 13 and dayside arcs near noon these are relatively infrequent and poorly understood other interesting effects occur such as flickering aurora black aurora and subvisual red arcs in addition to all these a weak glow often deep red observed around the two polar cusps the field lines separating the ones that close through the earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely images edit play media video of the aurora borealis from the international space station the altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by carl st rmer and his colleagues who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras 14 they discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150 km above the ground while extending at times to more than 1000 km images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities 15 film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties due to the different color spectra present and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure the results are somewhat unpredictable different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels and choice of film can be very important longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess david malin pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately 16 for scientific research proxies are often used such as ultraviolet and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans predictive techniques are also used to indicate the extent of the display a highly useful tool for aurora hunters 17 terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites 18 excellent images are possible with standard film using iso ratings between 100 and 400 and a single-lens reflex camera with full aperture a fast lens f1.4 50 mm for example and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds depending on the aurora s brightness 19 early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the university of saskatchewan using the scr-270 radar aurora during a geomagnetic storm that was most likely caused by a coronal mass ejection from the sun on 24 may 2010 taken from the iss diffuse aurora observed by de-1 satellite from high earth orbit estonia 18.03.2015 estonia 17.03.2015 estonia 14.12.2015

appear either as a diffuse glow or as curtains that extend approximately in the east west direction at some times they form quiet arcs at others they evolve and change constantly these are called active aurora the most distinctive and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs each curtain consists of many parallel rays each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field consistent with auroras being shaped by earth s magnetic field in situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field and spiral around them while moving toward earth the similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs arcs can fragment or break up into separate at times rapidly changing often rayed features that may fill the whole sky these are the discrete auroras which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night 20 and can display rapid subsecond variations in intensity the diffuse aurora though is a relatively featureless glow sometimes close to the limit of visibility 21 it can be distinguished from moonlit clouds because stars can be seen undiminished through the glow diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations the pulsation period can be typically many seconds so is not always obvious often there black aurora i e narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity a typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night 22 red at the highest altitudes excited atomic oxygen emits at 630 nm red low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity the low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the curtains scarlet crimson and carmine are the most often-seen hues of red for the auroras green at lower altitudes the more frequent collisions suppress the 630-nm red mode rather the 557.7 nm emission green dominates fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common the excited molecular nitrogen atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the n2 molecule plays a role here as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom which then radiates it away at the green wavelength red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues the rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100 km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains both the 557.7 and 630.0 nm wavelengths correspond to forbidden transitions of atomic oxygen slow mechanism that is responsible for the graduality 0.7 s and 107 s respectively of flaring and fading blue at yet lower altitudes atomic oxygen is uncommon and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum with 428 nm blue being dominant blue and purple emissions typically at the lower edges of the curtains show up at the highest levels of solar activity 23 the molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones ultraviolet ultraviolet radiation from auroras within the optical window but not visible to virtually all humans has been observed with the requisite equipment ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on mars 24 jupiter and saturn infrared infrared radiation in wavelengths that are within the optical window is also part of many auroras 24 25 yellow and pink are a mix of red and green or blue other shades of red as well as orange may be seen on rare occasions yellow-green is moderately common as red green and blue are the primary colours of additive synthesis of colours in theory practically any colour might be possible but the ones mentioned in this article comprise a virtually exhaustive list other auroral radiation edit in addition the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150 khz known as auroral kilometric radiation akr discovered in 1972 26 ionospheric absorption makes akr only observable from space x-ray emissions originating from the particles associated with auroras have also been detected 27 aurora noise edit aurora noise similar to a hissing or crackling noise begins about 70 m 230 ft above the earth s surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night the charged particles discharge when particles from the sun hit the inversion layer creating the noise 28 29 causes of auroras edit a full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete but the basic cause involves the interaction of the solar wind with the earth s magnetosphere the varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios a quiescent solar wind flowing past the earth s magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are open as opposed to being closed in the opposite hemisphere and provide diffusion through the bow shock it can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly and the loss-cone becomes depleted in the magnetotail however particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator as a result the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions isotropic and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons the leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere such replacement of hot electrons by cold ones is in complete accord with the 2nd law of thermodynamics the complete process which also generates an electric ring current around the earth is uncertain geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced solar wind causes distortions of the magnetotail magnetic substorms these substorms tend to occur after prolonged spells hours during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component this leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of earth as a result the solar wind moves magnetic flux tubes of magnetic field lines locked together with their resident plasma from the day side of earth to the magnetotail widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side ultimately some tail plasma can separate magnetic reconnection some blobs plasmoids are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind others are squeezed toward earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras mainly around midnight unloading process a geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around earth also producing enhancement of the ring current occasionally the resulting modification of the earth s magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone moon and aurora acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora this mechanism which is believed to predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field the pitch angle is thereby decreased and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere aurora australis 11 september 2005 as captured by nasa s image satellite digitally overlaid onto the blue marble composite image an animation created using the same satellite data is also available the details of these phenomena are not fully understood however it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field coupled with particle acceleration processes 30 furthermore in 2016 more than fifty citizen science observations under the aegis of aurorasaurus observed a heretofore unknown type of aurora which was dubbed steve a reference to the animated film over the hedge in which one of the characters randomly names a previously unknown creature steve subsequent reportage went viral and steve remains under active scientific investigation 31 auroral particles edit the immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960 when a pioneering rocket flight from fort churchill in canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above 32 since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone the main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere 33 these electrons often but not always exhibit a peak in their energy distribution and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have in contrast a smoothly falling energy distribution and an angular pitch-angle distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines 34 protons are also associated with auroras both discrete and diffuse auroras and the atmosphere edit auroras result from emissions of photons in the earth s upper atmosphere above 80 km 50 mi from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron and oxygen atoms and nitrogen based molecules returning from an excited state to ground state 35 they are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere both incoming electrons and protons may be involved excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon or by collision with another atom or molecule oxygen emissions green or orange-red depending on the amount of energy absorbed nitrogen emissions blue or red blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized red if returning to ground state from an excited state oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere so that red emissions do not have time to happen and eventually even green light emissions are prevented this is why there is a color differential with altitude at high altitudes oxygen red dominates then oxygen green and nitrogen blue red then finally nitrogen blue red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything green is the most common color then comes pink a mixture of light green and red followed by pure red then yellow a mixture of red and green and finally pure blue auroras and the ionosphere edit bright auroras are generally associated with birkeland currents schield et al 1969 36 zmuda and armstrong 1973 37 which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other in between some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric e layer 125 km the rest region 2 detours leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the partial ring current carried by magnetically trapped plasma the ionosphere is an ohmic conductor so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage which an as yet unspecified dynamo mechanism can supply electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms in another interpretation the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave particle interactions ionospheric resistance has a complex nature and leads to a secondary hall current flow by a strange twist of physics the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current the auroral electrojet an auroral electrojet index measured in nanotesla is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity kristian birkeland 38 deduced that the currents flowed in the east west directions along the auroral arc and such currents flowing from the dayside toward approximately midnight were later named auroral electrojets see also birkeland currents interaction of the solar wind with earth edit the earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind a rarefied flow of hot plasma a gas of free electrons and positive ions emitted by the sun in all directions a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the sun s outermost layer the corona the solar wind reaches earth with a velocity typically around 400 km s a density of around 5 ions cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2 5 nt for comparison earth s surface field is typically 30,000 50,000 nt during magnetic storms in particular flows can be several times faster the interplanetary magnetic field imf may also be much stronger joan feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity 39 her work resulted from data collected by the explorer 33 spacecraft the solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma ionized gas which conducts electricity it is well known since michael faraday s work around 1830 that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts across or is cut by rather than along the lines of the magnetic field an electric current is induced within the conductor the strength of the current depends on a the rate of relative motion b the strength of the magnetic field c the number of conductors ganged together and d the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion dynamos make use of this basic process the dynamo effect any and all conductors solid or otherwise are so affected including plasmas and other fluids the imf originates on the sun linked to the sunspots and its field lines lines of force are dragged out by the solar wind that alone would tend to line them up in the sun-earth direction but the rotation of the sun angles them at earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane known as the parker spiral the field lines passing earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge limb of the visible sun at any time 40 the solar wind and the magnetosphere being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind however this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines but less readily perpendicular to them energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection as already mentioned it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole schematic of earth s magnetosphere auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind 41 magnetosphere edit earth s magnetosphere is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the earth s magnetic field this forms an obstacle to the flow diverting it at an average distance of about 70,000 km 11 earth radii or re 42 producing a bow shock 12,000 km to 15,000 km 1.9 to 2.4 re further upstream the width of the magnetosphere abreast of earth is typically 190,000 km 30 re and on the night side a long magnetotail of stretched field lines extends to great distances 200 re the high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes the earth the flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence density and speed in the solar wind this flow is favoured by a southward component of the imf which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines 43 the flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the earth around the earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side in addition to moving perpendicular to the earth s magnetic field some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the earth s magnetic field lines gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones the cusps of the magnetosphere separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere producing an auroral glow on 26 february 2008 themis probes were able to determine for the first time the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms 44 two of the five probes positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification 45 geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the equinoxes it is not well understood but geomagnetic storms may vary with earth s seasons two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and earth s axis to the ecliptic plane as the earth orbits throughout a year it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field imf from different latitudes of the sun which is tilted at 8 degrees similarly the 23 degree tilt of the earth s axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident imf throughout a year these factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the imf links to the magnetosphere in turn this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the earth s inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras auroral particle acceleration edit the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere in contrast static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature 46 the electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation the increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the earth creates a magnetic mirror that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons the bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector this greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere and thereby the rates of ionisation excitation and consequent emission of auroral light acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere one early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static or quasi-static electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop 47 no mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equi-potential distribution and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible fundamentally poisson s equation indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop inexplicably though some authors 48 49 still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact in another example 50 there is little justification given for saying fast observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the ion beam energies leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of auroral particle acceleration another theory is based on acceleration by landau 51 resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region this process is essentially the same as that employed in plasma fusion laboratories throughout the world 52 and appears well able to account in principle for most if not all detailed properties of the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of auroras above below and within the acceleration region 53 iss expedition 6 team lake manicouagan is visible to the bottom left other mechanisms have also been proposed in particular alfv n waves wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by hannes alfv n 1942 which have been observed in the laboratory and in space the question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process however because this approach does not point out a different energy source and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of alfv n waves wikinews has related news aurora borealis caused by electrical space tornadoes other processes are also involved in the aurora and much remains to be learned auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 kev and are stopped higher up near 200 km such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen so that often such auroras are red on the other hand positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time with energies of 20 30 kev suggesting they might be an overflow along magnetic field lines of the copious ring current ions accelerated at such times by processes different from the ones described above some o ions conics also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora these ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines they therefore start at their mirror points and can travel only upward as they do so the mirror effect transforms their directions of motion from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it which gradually narrows down becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker auroral events of historical significance edit the discovery of a 1770 japanese diary in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient japanese capital of kyoto suggested that that storm may have been 7 larger than the carrington event which affected telegraph networks 54 55 the auroras that resulted from the great geomagnetic storm on both 28 august and 2 september 1859 however are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history in a paper to the royal society on 21 november 1861 balfour stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the kew observatory and established the connection between the 2 september 1859 auroral storm and the carrington-hodgson flare event when he observed that it is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken in the act 56 the second auroral event which occurred on 2 september 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense carrington-hodgson white light solar flare on 1 september 1859 produced auroras so widespread and extraordinarily bright that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements ship logs and newspapers throughout the united states europe japan and australia it was reported by the new york times that in boston on friday 2 september 1859 the aurora was so brilliant that at about one o clock ordinary print could be read by the light 57 one o clock est time on friday 2 september would have been 6 00 gmt and the self-recording magnetograph at the kew observatory was recording the geomagnetic storm which was then one hour old at its full intensity between 1859 and 1862 elias loomis published a series of nine papers on the great auroral exhibition of 1859 in the american journal of science where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event that aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history it is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked this insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era but also as a result of a significant portion of the 125,000 miles 201,000 km of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm some telegraph lines however seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off the following conversation occurred between two operators of the american telegraph line between boston and portland maine on the night of 2 september 1859 and reported in the boston traveler boston operator to portland operator please cut off your battery power source entirely for fifteen minutes portland operator will do so it is now disconnected boston mine is disconnected and we are working with the auroral current how do you receive my writing portland better than with our batteries on current comes and goes gradually boston my current is very strong at times and we can work better without the batteries as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately making current too strong at times for our relay magnets suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble portland very well shall i go ahead with business boston yes go ahead the conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner 57 such events led to the general conclusion that the effect of the aurorae on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires sometimes it entirely neutralizes them so that in effect no fluid is discoverable in them the aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter resembling in every respect that generated by the electric galvanic battery the currents from it change coming on the wires and then disappear the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith 58 historical theories superstition and mythology edit an aurora was described by the greek explorer pytheas in the 4th century bc 59 seneca wrote about auroras in the first book of his naturales quaestiones classifying them for instance as pithaei barrel-like chasmata chasm pogoniae bearded cyparissae like cypress trees and describing their manifold colors he wrote about whether they were above or below the clouds and recalled that under tiberius an aurora formed above the port city of ostia that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army stationed nearby for fire duty galloped to the rescue 60 it has been suggested that pliny the elder depicted the aurora borealis in his natural history when he refers to trabes chasma falling red flames and daylight in the night 61 the aboriginal australians associated auroras which are mainly low on the horizon and predominantly red with fire in the traditions of aboriginal australians the aurora australis is commonly associated with fire for example the gunditjmara people of western victoria called auroras puae buae ashes while the gunai people of eastern victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world the dieri people of south australia say that an auroral display is kootchee an evil spirit creating a large fire similarly the ngarrindjeri people of south australia refer to auroras seen over kangaroo island as the campfires of spirits in the land of the dead aboriginal people in southwest queensland believe the auroras to be the fires of the oola pikka ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora 62 bulfinch s mythology relates that in norse mythology the armour of the valkyrior sheds a strange flickering light which flashes up over the northern skies making what men call the aurora borealis or northern lights 63 there appears to be no evidence in old norse literature to substantiate this assertion 64 the first old norse account of nor rlj s is found in the norwegian chronicle konungs skuggsj from ad 1230 the chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from greenland and he gives three possible explanations that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent 65 walter william bryant wrote in his book kepler 1920 that tycho brahe seems to have been something of a hom opathist for he recommends sulfur to cure infectious diseases brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the aurora borealis 66 in the 1740s benjamin franklin theorized in his paper aurora borealis suppositions and conjectures towards forming an hypothesis for its explanation that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air 67 may not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds which are condens d there and fall in snow which electricity would enter the earth but cannot penetrate the ice may it not i say as a bottle overcharged break thro that low atmosphere and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the equator diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge strongly visible where densest and becoming less visible as it more diverges till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates or is mingled with the upper air benjamin franklin observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the swedish city of uppsala by anders celsius and olof hiorter in 1741 hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuations with an aurora being observed overhead this evidence helped to support their theory that magnetic storms are responsible for such compass fluctuations 68 church s 1865 painting aurora borealis a variety of native american myths surround the spectacle the european explorer samuel hearne traveled with chipewyan dene in 1771 and recorded their views on the ed-thin caribou according to hearne the dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when caribou fur is stroked they believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy 69 during the night after the battle of fredericksburg an aurora was seen from the battlefield the confederate army took this as a sign that god was on their side as the lights were rarely seen so far south the painting aurora borealis by frederic edwin church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the american civil war 70 non-terrestrial auroras edit jupiter aurora the far left bright spot connects magnetically to io the spots at the bottom of the image lead to ganymede and europa an aurora high above the northern part of saturn image taken by the cassini spacecraft a movie shows images from 81 hours of observations of saturn s aurora both jupiter and saturn have magnetic fields that are stronger than earth s jupiter s equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss compared to 0.3 gauss for earth and both have extensive radiation belts auroras have been observed on both gas planets most clearly using the hubble space telescope as well as on uranus and neptune 71 the auroras on the gas giants seem like earth s to be powered by the solar wind in addition however jupiter s moons especially io are powerful sources of auroras on jupiter these arise from electric currents along field lines field aligned currents generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon io which has active volcanism and an ionosphere is a particularly strong source and its currents also generate radio emissions which have been studied since 1955 using the hubble space telescope auroras over io europa and ganymede have all been observed auroras have also been observed on venus and mars venus has no magnetic field and so venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet a venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere an aurora was detected on mars on 14 august 2004 by the spicam instrument aboard mars express the aurora was located at terra cimmeria in the region of 177 east 52 south the total size of the emission region was about 30 km across and possibly about 8 km high by analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from mars global surveyor scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized this correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of mars 71 72 the first ever extra-solar auroras were discovered in july 2015 over the brown dwarf star lsr j1835 3259 73 the mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the northern lights a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere it has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material as is the case with jupiter and its moon io 74 see also edit aurora heraldry geomagnetic storm heliophysics list of plasma physics articles list of solar storms paschen s law space weather steve atmospheric phenomenon a phenomenon related to the aurora notes edit the name auroras is now the more common plural of aurora however aurorae is the original latin plural and is often used by scientists in some contexts aurora is an uncountable noun multiple sightings being referred to as the aurora modern style guides recommend that the names of meteorological phenomena such as aurora borealis be uncapitalized 1 references edit umn edu 18 july 2007 archived from on 22 july 2010 retrieved 5 august 2010 journal of geophysical research 2007
