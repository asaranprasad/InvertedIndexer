hertz - wikipedia hertz from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search hertz unit system si derived unit unit of frequency symbol hz named after heinrich hertz in si base units s 1 top to bottom lights flashing at frequencies f 0.5 hz 1.0 hz and 2.0 hz i e at 0.5 1.0 and 2.0 flashes per second respectively the time between each flash the period t is given by 1 f the reciprocal of f i e 2 1 and 0.5 seconds respectively the hertz symbol hz is the derived unit of frequency in the international system of units si and is defined as one cycle per second 1 it is named after heinrich rudolf hertz the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves hertz are commonly expressed in multiples kilohertz 103 hz khz megahertz 106 hz mhz gigahertz 109 hz ghz and terahertz 1012 hz thz some of the unit s most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications it is also used to describe the speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven contents 1 definition 2 history 3 applications 3.1 vibration 3.2 electromagnetic radiation 3.3 computers 4 si multiples

measures defined the second as the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom 3 and then adds it follows that the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of the caesium 133 atom is exactly 9 192 631 770 hertz hfs cs 9 192 631 770 hz in english hertz is also used as the plural form 4 as an si unit hz can be prefixed commonly used multiples are khz kilohertz 103 hz mhz megahertz 106 hz ghz gigahertz 109 hz and thz terahertz 1012 hz one hertz simply means one cycle per second typically that which is being counted is a complete cycle 100 hz means one hundred cycles per second and so on the unit may be applied to any periodic event for example a clock might be said to tick at 1 hz or a human heart might be said to beat at 1.2 hz the occurrence rate of aperiodic or stochastic events is expressed in reciprocal second or inverse second 1 s or s 1 in general or in the specific case of radioactive decay in becquerels 5 whereas 1 hz is 1 cycle per second 1 bq is 1 aperiodic radionuclide event per second even though angular velocity angular frequency and the unit hertz all have the dimension 1 s angular velocity and angular frequency are not expressed in hertz 6 but rather in an appropriate angular unit such as radians per second thus a disc rotating at 60 revolutions per minute rpm is said to be rotating at either 2 rad s or 1 hz where the former measures the angular velocity and the latter reflects the number of complete revolutions per second the conversion between a frequency f measured in hertz and an angular velocity measured in radians per second is 2 f displaystyle omega 2 pi f and f 2 displaystyle f frac omega 2 pi this si unit is named after heinrich hertz as with every international system of units si unit named for a person the first letter of its symbol is upper case hz however when an si unit is spelled out in english it should always begin with a lower case letter hertz except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case note that degree celsius conforms to this rule because the d is lowercase based on section 5.2 history edit the hertz is named after the german physicist heinrich hertz 1857 1894 who made important scientific contributions to the study of electromagnetism the name was established by the international electrotechnical commission iec in 1930 7 it was adopted by the general conference on weights and measures cgpm conf rence g n rale des poids et mesures in 1960 replacing the previous name for the unit cycles per second cps along with its related multiples primarily kilocycles per second kc s and megacycles per second mc s and occasionally kilomegacycles per second kmc s the term cycles per second was largely replaced by hertz by the 1970s one hobby magazine electronics illustrated declared their intention to stick with the traditional kc mc etc units 8 applications edit a sine wave with varying frequency a heartbeat is an example of a non- sinusoidal periodic phenomenon that may be analyzed in terms of frequency two cycles are illustrated vibration edit sound is a traveling longitudinal wave which is an oscillation of pressure humans perceive frequency of sound waves as pitch each musical note corresponds to a particular frequency which can be measured in hertz an infant s ear is able to perceive frequencies ranging from 20 hz to 20,000 hz the average adult human can hear sounds between 20 hz and 16,000 hz 9 the range of ultrasound infrasound and other physical vibrations such as molecular and atomic vibrations extends from a few femtohertz 10 into the terahertz range 11 and beyond electromagnetic radiation edit electromagnetic radiation is often described by its frequency the number of oscillations of the perpendicular electric and magnetic fields per second expressed in hertz radio frequency radiation is usually measured in kilohertz khz megahertz mhz or gigahertz ghz light is electromagnetic radiation that is even higher in frequency and has frequencies in the range of tens infrared to thousands ultraviolet of terahertz electromagnetic radiation with frequencies in the low terahertz range intermediate between those of the highest normally usable radio frequencies and long-wave infrared light is often called terahertz radiation even higher frequencies exist such as that of gamma rays which can be measured in exahertz for historical reasons the frequencies of light and higher frequency electromagnetic radiation are more commonly specified in terms of their wavelengths or photon energies for a more detailed treatment of this and the above frequency ranges see electromagnetic spectrum computers edit in computers most central processing units cpu are labeled in terms of their clock rate expressed in megahertz 106 hz or gigahertz 109 hz this specification refers to the frequency of the cpu s master clock signal this signal is a square wave which is an electrical voltage that switches between low and high logic values at regular intervals as the hertz has become the primary unit of measurement accepted by the general populace to determine the performance of a cpu many experts have criticized this approach which they claim is an easily manipulable benchmark some processors use multiple clock periods to perform a single operation while others can perform multiple operations in a single cycle 12 for personal computers cpu clock speeds have ranged from approximately 1 mhz in the late 1970s atari commodore apple computers to up to 6 ghz in ibm power microprocessors various computer buses such as the front-side bus connecting the cpu and northbridge also operate at various frequencies in the megahertz range si multiples edit si multiples for hertz hz submultiples multiples value si symbol name value si symbol

occur naturally in the frequencies of the quantum-mechanical vibrations of high-energy or equivalently massive particles although these are not directly observable and must be inferred from their interactions with other phenomena by convention these are typically not expressed in hertz but in terms of the equivalent quantum energy which is proportional to the frequency by the factor of planck
