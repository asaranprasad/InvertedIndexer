quasi-satellite - wikipedia quasi-satellite from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search diagram of generic quasi-satellite orbit a quasi-satellite is an object in a specific type of co-orbital configuration 1 1 orbital resonance with a planet where the object stays close to that planet over many orbital periods a quasi-satellite s orbit around the sun takes exactly the same time as the planet s but has a different eccentricity usually greater as shown in the diagram on the right when viewed from the perspective of the planet the quasi-satellite will appear to travel in an oblong retrograde loop around the planet in contrast to true satellites quasi-satellite orbits lie outside the planet s hill sphere and are unstable over time they tend to evolve to other types of resonant motion where they no longer remain in the planet s neighborhood then possibly later move back to a quasi-satellite orbit etc other types of orbit in a 1 1 resonance with the planet include horseshoe orbits and tadpole orbits around the lagrangian points but objects in these orbits do not stay near the planet s longitude over many revolutions about the star objects in horseshoe orbits are known to sometimes periodically transfer to a relatively short-lived quasi-satellite orbit 1 and are sometimes confused with them an example of such an object is 2002 aa29 the word geosynchronous is sometimes used to describe quasi-satellites of the earth because their motion around the sun is synchronized with earth s however this usage is unconventional and confusing conventionally geosynchronous satellites revolve in the prograde sense around the earth with orbital periods that are synchronized to the earth s rotation contents 1 examples 1.1 venus 1.2 earth 1.3 neptune 1.4 other planets 1.5 artificial quasi-satellites 1.6 accidental quasi-satellites 2 see also 3 references 4 external links examples edit venus edit venus has a quasi-satellite 2002 ve68 this asteroid is also a mercury- and earth-crosser it seems to have been a companion to venus for the last 7000 years or so only and is destined to be ejected from this orbital arrangement about 500 years from now 2 earth edit 3753 cruithne and earth seem to follow each other in their orbits as of 2016 earth has several known quasi-satellites 164207 2004 gu9 3 277810 2006 fv35 4 2013 lx28 5 2014 ol339 6 and 469219 2016 ho3 7 8 2016 ho3 was discovered in 2016 in a quasi-satellite orbit and is predicted to be stable in this orbital location for several hundred years in contrast to 2003 yn107 which departed its near-earth quasi-satellite position a few years after it was discovered 9 earth quasi-satellites tend to stay between 38 and 100 lunar distances 9 3753 cruithne 10 2002 aa29 1 2003 yn107 and 2015 so2 5 are minor planets in a horseshoe orbit that can transition into a quasi-satellite orbit 2003 yn107 was in a quasi-satellite orbit from 1996 to 2006 neptune edit 309239 2007 rw10 is a temporary quasi-satellite of neptune 11 the object has been a quasi-satellite of neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years 11 other planets edit based on simulations it is believed that uranus and neptune could potentially hold quasi-satellites for the age of the solar system about 4.5 billion years 12 but a quasi-satellite s orbit would remain stable for only 10 million years near jupiter and 100,000 years near saturn jupiter and saturn are known to have quasi-satellites artificial quasi-satellites edit in early 1989 the soviet phobos 2 spacecraft was injected into a quasi-satellite orbit around the martian moon phobos with a mean orbital radius of about 100 kilometres 62 mi from phobos 13 according to computations it could have then stayed trapped in the vicinity of phobos for many months the spacecraft was lost due to a malfunction of the on-board control system accidental quasi-satellites edit some objects are known to be accidental quasi-satellites which means that they are not forced into the configuration by the gravitational influence of the body of which they are quasi-satellites 14 the minor planets ceres vesta and pluto are known to have accidental quasi-satellites 14 in the case of pluto the known accidental quasi-satellite 15810 arawn is like pluto a plutino and is forced into this configuration by the gravitational influence of neptune 14 this dynamical behavior is recurrent arawn becomes a quasi-satellite of pluto every 2.4 myr and remains in that configuration for nearly 350,000 years 14 15 16
