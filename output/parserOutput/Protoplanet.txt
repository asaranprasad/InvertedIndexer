protoplanet - wikipedia protoplanet from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a surviving protoplanet vesta a protoplanet is a large planetary embryo that originated within a protoplanetary disc and has undergone internal melting to produce a differentiated interior protoplanets are thought to form out of kilometer-sized planetesimals that gravitationally perturb each other s orbits and collide gradually coalescing into the dominant planets in the case of the solar system it is thought that the collisions of planetesimals created a few hundred planetary embryos such embryos were similar to ceres and pluto with masses of about 1022 to 1023 kg and were a few thousand kilometers in diameter over the course of hundreds of millions of years they collided with one another the exact sequence whereby planetary embryos collided to assemble the planets is not known but it is thought that initial collisions would have replaced the first generation of embryos with a second generation consisting of fewer but larger embryos these in their turn would have collided to create a third generation of fewer but even larger embryos eventually only a handful of embryos were left which collided to complete the assembly of the planets proper 1 early protoplanets had more radioactive elements the quantity of which has been reduced over time due to radioactive decay heating due to radioactivity impact and gravitational pressure melted parts of protoplanets as they grew toward being planets in melted zones their heavier elements sank to the center whereas lighter elements rose to the surface such a process is known as planetary differentiation the composition of some meteorites show that differentiation took place in some asteroids according to the giant impact hypothesis the moon formed from a colossal impact of a hypothetical protoplanet called theia with earth early in the solar system s history in the inner solar system the three protoplanets to survive more-or-less intact are the asteroids ceres pallas and vesta psyche is likely the survivor of a violent hit-and-run with another object that stripped off the outer rocky layers of a protoplanet 2 the asteroid metis may also have a similar origin history to psyche 3 the asteroid lutetia also has characteristics that resemble a protoplanet 4 5 kuiper-belt dwarf planets have also been referred to as protoplanets 6 because iron meteorites have been found on earth it is deemed likely that there once were other metal-cored protoplanets in the asteroid belt that since have been disrupted and that are the source of these meteorites in february 2013 astronomers made the first direct observation of a protoplanet forming in a disk of gas and dust around a distant star 7 see also edit fusor astronomy mesoplanet planetesimal references edit mcbride neil iain gilmour philip a bland elaine a moore mike widdowson ian wright 2004 an introduction to the solar system cambridge cambridge university press p 56 isbn 9780521837354 kelley michael s michael j gaffey 2000 9 metis and 113 amalthea a genetic asteroid pair icarus 144 1 27 38 bibcode doi discovery space discovery communications 2009-10-08 retrieved 2009-10-08 klotz irene 2011-10-27 discovery news discovery communications retrieved 2011-10-27 alan boyle 2009-10-08 msnbc retrieved 2009-09-12 european southern observatory 28 february 2013 retrieved 2 march 2013 external links edit minor planet mailing list july 15 2011 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title protoplanet oldid 812778257 categories protoplanets types of planet navigation menu search this page was last edited on 29 november 2017 at 20 23 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
