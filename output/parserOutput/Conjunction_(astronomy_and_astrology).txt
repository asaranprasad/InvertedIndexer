conjunction astronomy - wikipedia conjunction astronomy from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from conjunction astronomy and astrology jump to navigation search a conjunction of mercury and venus appears above the moon as viewed from the paranal observatory in northern chile in astronomy a conjunction occurs when two astronomical objects or spacecraft have either the same right ascension or the same ecliptic longitude usually as observed from earth 1 2 the astronomical symbol for conjunction is in unicode u 260c and handwritten the conjunction symbol is not used in modern astronomy it continues to be used in astrology when two objects always appear close to the ecliptic such as two planets the moon and a planet or the sun and a planet this fact implies an apparent close approach between the objects as seen on the sky a related word appulse is the minimum apparent separation on the sky of two astronomical objects 3 conjunctions involve either two objects in the solar system or one object in the solar system and a more distant object such as a star a conjunction is an apparent phenomenon caused by the observer s perspective the two objects involved are not actually close to one another in space conjunctions between two bright objects close to the ecliptic such as two bright planets can be seen with the naked eye contents 1 passing close 2 passing closer 3 position of the

five of our solar system s eight planets and the moon could be seen from cerro paranal chile 4 more generally in the particular case of two planets it means that they merely have the same right ascension and hence the same hour angle this is called conjunction in right ascension however there is also the term conjunction in ecliptic longitude at such conjunction both objects have the same ecliptic longitude conjunction in right ascension and conjunction in ecliptic longitude do not normally take place at the same time but in most cases nearly at the same time however at triple conjunctions it is possible that a conjunction only in right ascension or ecliptic length occurs at the time of conjunction it does not matter if in right ascension or in ecliptic longitude the involved planets are close together upon the celestial sphere in the vast majority of such cases one of the planets will appear to pass north or south of the other passing closer edit in the night sky over eso s very large telescope vlt observatory at paranal the moon shines along with two bright companions venus and jupiter however if two celestial bodies attain the same declination at the time of a conjunction in right ascension or the same ecliptic latitude at a conjunction in ecliptic longitude the one that is closer to the earth will pass in front of the other in such a case a syzygy takes place if one object moves into the shadow of another the event is an eclipse for example if the moon passes into the shadow of earth and disappears from view this event is called a lunar eclipse if the visible disk of the nearer object is considerably smaller than that of the farther object the event is called a transit when mercury passes in front of the sun it is a transit of mercury and when venus passes in front of the sun it is a transit of venus when the nearer object appears larger than the farther one it will completely obscure its smaller companion this is called an occultation an example of an occultation is when the moon passes between earth and the sun causing the sun to disappear either entirely or partially this phenomenon is commonly known as a solar eclipse occultations in which the larger body is neither the sun nor the moon are very rare more frequent however is an occultation of a planet by the moon several such events are visible every year from various places on earth position of the observer edit a conjunction as a phenomenon of perspective is an event that involves two astronomical bodies seen by an observer on the earth times and details depend only very slightly on the observer s location on the earth s surface with the differences being greatest for conjunctions involving the moon because of its relative closeness but even for the moon the time of a conjunction never differs by more than a few hours superior and inferior edit as seen from a planet that is superior if an inferior planet is on the opposite side of the sun it is in superior conjunction with the sun an inferior conjunction occurs when the two planets lie in a line on the same side of the sun in an inferior conjunction the superior planet is in opposition to the sun as seen from the inferior planet the terms inferior conjunction and superior conjunction are used in particular for the planets mercury and venus which are inferior planets as seen from the earth however this definition can be applied to any pair of planets as seen from the one farther from the sun a planet or asteroid or comet is simply said to be in conjunction when it is in conjunction with the sun as seen from the earth the moon is in conjunction with the sun at new moon quasiconjunction edit in a quasiconjunction a planet in retrograde motion always either mercury or venus from the point of view of the earth will drop back in right ascension until it almost allows another planet to overtake it but then the former planet will resume its forward motion and thereafter appear to draw away from it again this will occur in the morning sky before dawn the reverse may happen in the evening sky after dusk with mercury or venus entering retrograde motion just as it is about to overtake another planet often mercury and venus are both of the planets involved and when this situation arises they may remain in very close visual proximity for several days or even longer the quasiconjunction is reckoned as occurring at the time the distance in right ascension between the two planets is smallest even though when declination is taken into account they may appear closer together shortly before or after this notable conjunctions edit conjunction of venus left and jupiter bottom with the nearby crescent moon seen from s o paulo brazil on 1 december 2008 moon venus and jupiter moon jupiter top and venus right at dusk seen from madrid spain on 20 june 2015 1899 edit in early december 1899 the sun and the naked-eye planets appeared to lie within a band 35 degrees wide along the ecliptic as seen from the earth as a consequence over the period 1 4 december 1899 the moon reached conjunction with in order jupiter uranus the sun mercury mars saturn and venus most of these conjunctions would not have been visible because of the glare of the sun 1962 edit over the period 4 6 february 1962 in a rare series of events mercury and venus reached conjunction as observed from the earth followed by venus and jupiter then by mars and saturn conjunctions took place between the moon and in turn mars saturn the sun mercury venus and jupiter mercury also reached inferior conjunction with the sun the conjunction between the moon and the sun at new moon produced a total solar eclipse visible in indonesia and the pacific ocean 5 when these five naked-eye planets would have been visible in the vicinity of the sun in the sky 1987 edit mercury venus and mars separately reached conjunction with each other and each separately with the sun within a 7-day period in august 1987 as seen from the earth the moon also reached conjunction with each of these bodies on 24 august however none of these conjunctions would have been observable due to the glare of the sun 6 2000 edit in may 2000 in a very rare event several planets lay in the vicinity of the sun in the sky as seen from the earth and a series of conjunctions took place jupiter mercury and saturn each reached conjunction with the sun in the period 8 10 may these three planets in turn were in conjunction with each other and with venus over a period of a few weeks however most of these conjunctions would not have been visible from the earth because of the glare from the sun 6 nasa referred to may 5 as the date of the conjunction 7 2002 edit venus mars and saturn appeared close together in the evening sky in early may 2002 with a conjunction of mars and saturn occurring on 4 may this was followed by a conjunction of venus and saturn on 7 may and another of venus and mars on 10 may when their angular separation was only 18 arcminutes a series of conjunctions between the moon and in order saturn mars and venus took place on 14 may although it would not have been possible to observe all these in darkness from any single location on the earth 6 2007 edit a conjunction of the moon and mars took place on 24 december 2007 very close to the time of the full moon and at the time when mars was at opposition to the sun mars and the full moon would have appeared close together in the sky worldwide with an occultation of mars occurring for observers in some far northern locations 8 a similar conjunction took place on 21 may 2016 2008 edit a conjunction of venus and jupiter occurred on 1 december 2008 and several hours later both planets separately reached conjunction with the crescent moon 9 an occultation of venus by the moon was visible from some locations 10 the three objects appeared close together in the sky from any location on the earth 2013 edit at the end of may mercury venus and jupiter went through a series of conjunctions only a few days apart 2015 edit june 30th - venus and jupiter come close together in a planetary conjunction they came approximately 1 3 a degree apart the conjunction had been nicknamed the star of bethlehem 11 venus-jupiter conjunction of june 30 2015 2016 edit on the morning of january 9th venus and saturn came together in a conjunction 12 on august 27 mercury and venus were in conjunction followed by a conjunction of venus and jupiter meaning that the three planets were very close together in the evening sky 2017 edit on the morning of november 13th venus and jupiter were in conjunction meaning that they appeared close together in the morning sky 2018 edit mars - jupiter conjunction seen from morphett vale south australia on the early hours of january 7th mars and jupiter were in conjunction the pair was only 0.25 degrees apart in the sky at its closest 13 conjunctions of planets in right ascension 2005 2020
