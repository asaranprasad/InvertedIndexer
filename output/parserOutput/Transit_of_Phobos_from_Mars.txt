eclipse of the sun by phobos as viewed by the mars curiosity rover 20 august 2013 phobos transits the sun as viewed by the mars opportunity rover 10 march 2004 a transit of phobos across the sun as seen from mars takes place when phobos passes directly between the sun and a point on the surface of mars obscuring a large part of the sun s disc for an observer on mars during a transit phobos can be seen from mars as a large black disc rapidly moving across the face of the sun at the same time the shadow antumbra of phobos moves across the martian surface the event could also be regarded as a particularly quick and shallow annular solar eclipse by phobos contents 1 transit 2 images of the shadow 2.1 viking 1 2.2 26 august 1999 image 2.3 other images 3 see also 4 references 5 further

usually lasts only thirty seconds or so due to the moon s very rapid orbital period of about 7.6 hours because phobos orbits close to mars and in line with its equator transits of phobos occur somewhere on mars on most days of the martian year its orbital inclination is 1.08 so the latitude of its shadow projected onto the martian surface shows a seasonal variation moving from 70.4 s to 70.4 n and back again over the course of a martian year phobos is so close to mars that it is not visible south of 70.4 s or north of 70.4 n for some days in the year its shadow misses the surface entirely and falls north or south of mars at any given geographical location on the surface of mars there are two intervals in a martian year when the shadow of phobos or deimos is passing through its latitude during each such interval about half a dozen transits of phobos can be seen by observers at that geographical location compared to zero or one transits of deimos transits of phobos happen during martian autumn and winter in the respective hemisphere close to the equator they happen around the autumnal equinox and the vernal equinox while farther from the equator they happen closer to the winter solstice observers at high latitudes but less than 70.4 will see a noticeably smaller angular diameter for phobos because they are considerably farther away from it than observers at mars s equator as a result transits of phobos for such observers will cover less of the sun s disk because it orbits so close to mars phobos cannot be seen north of 70.4 n or south of 70.4 s observers at such latitudes will obviously not see transits either mars rover opportunity rover photographed transits of phobos on 7 10 and 12 march 2004 in the captions below the first row shows earth time utc

with the times reported for the series of images above this may be due to imprecision in the ephemeris data used by jpl horizons also the jpl horizons data gives local apparent solar time while the times reported above are probably some form of mean solar time and therefore some of the discrepancy would be due to the martian equivalent of the equation of time transits of phobos from the mars

martian surface this shadow on the martian surface has been photographed on many occasions by mars global surveyor viking 1 edit a repeated line scan image by the viking 1 lander detects phobos shadow the brownish stripes in the middle represent the martian surface visible above the spacecraft the colors are distorted to enhance the visibility of the shadow the blue and white horizontal stripes correspond to test chart patches on the spacecraft the viking 1 orbiter images phobos shadow a few kilometers directly north of the viking 1 lander in the 1970s the viking 1 lander and orbiter photographed the shadow as well the lander detected the penumbral shadow of phobos passing across it 1 this was detected only as a slight dimming of the ambient light the viking lander camera did not image the sun the shadow took about 20 seconds to pass over the lander moving at about 2 km s the shadow was simultaneously imaged from the viking 1 orbiter which permitted locating the position of the lander in the orbiter pictures 26 august 1999 image edit the penumbral shadow of phobos on the martian landscape as seen by mars global surveyor on 26 august 1999 the center of the shadow was at 10.9 n 49.2 w at 04 00 33 utc far more detailed images of the shadow were taken with the arrival in 1997 of the mars global surveyor and its high-resolution mars orbital camera one such image was taken on 26 august 1999 and shows the shadow at high resolution this image was featured in a 1 november 1999 nasa press release 2 by examining maps of mars 3 we see the shadow is centered at around 10.9 n 49.2 w we can also look up the original image files at m04-03241 red 4 and m04-03242 blue 5 part of the gallery of moc wide-angle images region lunae palus subphase m04 6 the image start time was 03 26 13.01 utc the line integration time is 80.4800 milliseconds and the downtrack summing factor is 4 since the shadow is centered at 6400 pixels from the bottom of the original 10800-pixel-high image mars global surveyor had a south-to-north sun-synchronous orbit we add 6400 0.08048 4 2060.3 seconds 34 minutes 20.3 seconds to get a time of 04 00 33.3 utc for the center of the shadow putting in the longitude latitude altitude coordinate values -310.8,10.9,0 into jpl horizons 7 we see that the predicted time of mid-transit was 04 00 36 utc in perfect agreement within the error of determining the exact longitude and latitude of the center of the shadow this was about 14 41 martian local solar time and the sun s altitude was 46.5 above the horizon jpl horizons also shows that on 26 august 1999 the distance between the earth and mars was 9.6 light-minutes other images edit the penumbral shadow of phobos on mars on 1 september 1999 as imaged by mars global surveyor the center of the shadow was at 14 n 236 w at 20 49 02.4 utc the text label of 20 13 05 represents the image start time many dozens of other images of the shadow exist but these are much lower resolution by a factor of 27 4 three such images are shown in the 1 november 1999 nasa press release 8 note the timestamps printed on the photos in the nasa press release do not correspond to the actual time that the shadow was imaged rather they represent the image start time of a vertically much larger original image mars global surveyor orbits mars in a sun-synchronous polar orbit with orbital period 117.65 minutes moving from south pole to north pole and continuously points its camera straight down the result is an image in the form of a very long thin vertical strip where the pixels in the top part of the image are imaged nearly one hour after those in the bottom part of the image in principle the image could be as much as 43200 pixels high but downtrack summing is used to merge adjacent lines for instance a downtrack summing factor of 27 causes every 27 lines to be merged into one resulting in an image 1600 pixels high thus to determine the actual time that the phobos shadow was imaged it is necessary to locate the original image and measure how many pixels from the bottom of the image the shadow is found and add the corresponding offset to the image start time for example we examine the image labeled with the timestamp 1 september 1999 20 13 05 utc we have the original images m07-00166 red 9 and m07-00167 blue 10 part of the gallery of moc global-map images subphase m07 11 the shadow is situated at roughly 14 n 236 w 12 in this case the image start time is 20 13 04.69 utc the line integration time is 80.48 milliseconds and the downtrack summing factor is 27 the shadow is about 8 pixels high centered at 993 pixels from the bottom of the original 1600-pixel-high image we add 993 0.08048 27 2157.75 seconds 35 minutes 57.75 seconds to get a time of 20 49 02.4 utc for the center of the shadow putting in the longitude latitude altitude coordinate values -124,14,0 into jpl horizons gives an expected time of 20 49 for the transit which is in good agreement once again on 1
