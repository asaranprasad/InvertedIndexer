software has been developed to crawl the web and download all publicly accessible world wide web pages the gopher hierarchy the netnews usenet bulletin board system and downloadable software 11 the information collected by these crawlers does not include all the information available on the internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites archive-it org was developed in 2005 by the internet archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives 12 crawl are contributed from various sources some imported from third parties and others generated internally by the archive 6 for example crawls are contributed by the sloan foundation and alexa crawls run by ia on behalf of nara and the internet memory foundation mirrors of common crawl 6 the worldwide web crawls have been running since 2010 and capture the global web 13 6 the frequency of snapshot captures varies per website 6 websites in the worldwide web crawls are included in a crawl list with the site archived once per crawl 6 a crawl can take months or even years to complete depending on size 6 for example wide crawl number 13 started on january 9 2015 and completed on july 11 2016 14 however there may be multiple crawls ongoing at any one time and a site might be included in more than one crawl list so how often a site is crawled varies widely 6 storage capabilities edit as of 2009 the

petabox rack systems manufactured by capricorn technologies 16 in 2009 the internet archive migrated its customized storage architecture to sun open storage and hosts a new data center in a sun modular datacenter on sun microsystems california campus 17 in 2011 a new improved version of the wayback machine with an updated interface and fresher index of archived content was made available for public testing 18 in march 2011 it was said on the wayback machine forum that the beta of the new wayback machine has a more complete and up-to-date index of all crawled materials into 2010 and will continue to be updated regularly the index driving the classic wayback machine only has a little bit of material past 2008 and no further index updates are planned as it will be phased out this year

exclusion policy edit historically wayback machine respected the robots exclusion standard robots txt in determining if a website would be crawled or not or if already crawled if its archives would be publicly viewable website owners had the option to opt-out of wayback machine through the use of robots txt it applied robots txt rules retroactively if a site blocked the internet archive any previously archived pages from the domain were immediately rendered unavailable as well in addition the internet archive stated sometimes a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site we comply with these requests 39 in addition the website says the internet archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection 40 oakland archive policy edit wayback s retroactive exclusion policy is based in part upon recommendations for managing removal requests and preserving archival integrity published by the school of information management and systems at university of california berkeley in 2002 which gives a website owner the right block access to the site s archives 41 wayback has complied with this policy to help avoid expensive litigation 42 the wayback retroactive exclusion policy began to relax in 2017 when it stopped honoring robots txt on u s government and military web sites for both crawling and displaying web pages as of april 2017 wayback is exploring ignoring robots txt more broadly not just for u s government websites 43 44 45 46 uses edit this section needs expansion you can help by may 2017 the site is frequently used by journalists and citizens to review dead websites dated news reports or changes to website contents its content has been used to hold politicians accountable and expose battlefield lies 47 in 2014 an archived social media page of separatist rebel leader in ukraine igor girkin showed him boasting about his troops having shot down a suspected ukrainian military airplane before it became known that the plane actually was a civilian malaysian airlines jet after which he deleted the post and blamed ukraine s military 47 48 in 2017 the march for science originated from a discussion on reddit that indicated someone had visited archive org and discovered that all references to climate change had been deleted from the white house website in response a user commented there needs to be a scientists march on washington 49 50 51 furthermore the site is used heavily for verification providing access to references and content creation by wikipedia editors citation needed in legal evidence edit civil litigation edit netbula llc v chordiant software inc edit in a 2009 case netbula llc v chordiant software inc defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robots txt file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from netbula s site pages that chordiant believed would support its case 52 netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbula s website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly 53 an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiant s motion however stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means without considerable burden expense and disruption to its operations 52 magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california san jose division rejected netbula s arguments and ordered them to disable the robots txt blockage temporarily in order to allow chordiant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought 52 telewizja polska edit in an october 2004 case telewizja polska usa inc v echostar satellite no 02 c 3293 65 fed r evid serv 673 n d ill oct 15 2004 a litigant attempted to use the wayback machine archives as a source of admissible evidence perhaps for the first time telewizja polska is the provider of tvp polonia and echostar operates the dish network prior to the trial proceedings echostar indicated that it intended to offer wayback machine snapshots as proof of the past content of telewizja polska s website telewizja polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source but magistrate judge arlander keys rejected telewizja polska s assertion of hearsay and denied tvp s motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial 54 55 at the trial however district court judge ronald guzman the trial judge overruled magistrate keys findings citation needed and held that neither the affidavit of the internet archive employee nor the underlying pages i e the telewizja polska website were admissible as evidence judge guzman reasoned that the employee s affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticating citation needed patent law edit provided some additional requirements are met e g providing an authoritative statement of the archivist the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application 56 limitations of utility edit there are technical limitations to archiving a website and as a consequence it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints answers or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore can contain errors for example archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore do not include the contents of non-restful e-commerce databases in their archives 57 legal status edit in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator 58 the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be found in the faq section of the site 59 archived content legal issues edit a number of cases have been brought against the internet archive specifically for its wayback machine archiving efforts scientology edit in late 2002 the internet archive removed various sites that were critical of scientology from the wayback machine 60 an error message stated that this was in response to a request by the site owner 61 later it was clarified that lawyers from the church of scientology had demanded the removal and that the site owners did not want their material removed 62 healthcare advocates inc edit in 2003 harding earley follmer frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archive s wayback machine the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid based on the content of their website from several years prior the plaintiff healthcare advocates then amended their complaint to include the internet archive accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the dmca and the computer fraud and abuse act healthcare advocates claimed that since they had installed a robots txt file on their website even if after the initial lawsuit was filed the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the wayback machine however some material continued to be publicly visible on wayback 63 the lawsuit was settled out of court after wayback fixed the problem 64 suzanne shell edit in december 2005 activist suzanne shell filed suit demanding internet archive pay her us 100,000 for archiving her website profane-justice org between 1999 and 2004 65 66 internet archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california on january 20 2006 seeking a judicial determination that internet archive did not violate shell s copyright shell responded and brought a countersuit against internet archive for archiving her site which she alleges is in violation of her terms of service 67 on february 13 2007 a judge for the united states district court for the district of colorado dismissed all counterclaims except breach of contract 66 the internet archive did not move to dismiss copyright infringement claims shell asserted arising out of its copying activities which would also go forward 68 on april 25 2007 internet archive and suzanne shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit 65 the internet archive said it has no interest in including materials in the wayback machine of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived we recognize that ms shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret that the inclusion of her web site in the wayback machine resulted in this litigation shell said i respect the historical value of internet archive s goal i never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm 69 daniel davydiuk edit in 2013 2016 a pornographic actor tried to remove archived images of himself from the wayback machine s archive first by sending multiple dmca requests to the archive and then by appealing to the

long-term of multiple generations next to nothing will survive in a useful way besides if we have continuity in our technological civilization by which a lot of the bare data will remain findable and searchable 80 some find the internet archive which describes itself to be built for the long-term 81 to be working furiously to capture data before it disappears without any long-term infrastructure
