ten-billionth of a metre or 0.1 nanometre its symbol is a letter in the swedish alphabet the natural sciences and technology often use ngstr m to express sizes of atoms molecules microscopic biological structures and lengths of chemical bonds arrangement of atoms in crystals wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and dimensions of integrated circuit parts atoms of phosphorus sulfur and chlorine are about an ngstr m in covalent radius while a hydrogen atom is about half an ngstr m see atomic radius visible light has wavelengths in the range of 4000 7000 the unit is named after the swedish physicist anders jonas ngstr m 1814 1874 the symbol is always written with a ring diacritic as the letter in the swedish alphabet the unit s name is often written in english without the diacritics 3 but the official definitions do contain them 4 5 it is not a part of the si system of units contents 1 use 2 history 3 symbol 4 see also 5 notes 6 references use edit the ngstr m is used extensively in crystallography solid-state physics and chemistry as a unit for d-spacings the distance between atomic planes in a crystal 6 cell parameters inter-atomic distances and x-ray wavelengths as these values are often in the 1 10 range for example the inorganic crystal structure database 7 presents all these values using the ngstr m history edit anders jonas ngstr m was a pioneer in the field of spectroscopy and he is also well known for his studies of astrophysics heat transfer terrestrial magnetism and the aurora borealis in 1852 ngstr m formulated in optiska unders kningar 8 in english translation optical researches 9 a law of absorption later modified somewhat and known as kirchhoff s law of thermal radiation in 1868 ngstr m created a chart of the spectrum of sunlight in which he expressed the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum in multiples of one ten-millionth of a millimetre or 6990100000000000000 10 7 mm 10 because the human eye is sensitive to wavelengths from about 7003400000000000000 4000 to 7003700000000000000 7000 visible light that choice of unit supported sufficiently accurate measurements of visible wavelengths without resorting to fractional numbers citation needed ngstr m s chart and table of wavelengths in the solar spectrum became widely used in solar physics which adopted the unit and named it after him it subsequently spread to the rest of astronomical spectroscopy atomic spectroscopy and subsequently to other sciences that deal with atomic-scale structures though intended to correspond to 6990100000000000000 10 10 metres for precise spectral analysis the ngstr m had to be defined more accurately than the metre which until 1960 was still defined based on the length of a bar of metal held in paris the use of metal bars had been involved in an early error in the value of the ngstr m of about one part in 6000 ngstr m took the precaution of having the standard bar he used checked against a standard in paris but the metrologist henri tresca reported it to be so much shorter than it really was that ngstr m s corrected results were more in error than the uncorrected ones 11 in 1907 the international astronomical union defined the international ngstr m by declaring the wavelength of the red line of cadmium in air equal to 6438.46963 international ngstr ms and this definition was endorsed by the international bureau of weights and measures in 1927 12 from 1927 to 1960 the ngstr m remained a secondary unit of length for use in spectroscopy defined separately from the metre in 1960 the metre itself was redefined in spectroscopic terms which allowed the ngstr m to be redefined as being exactly 0.1 nanometres the ngstr m is internationally recognized but is not a formal part of the international system of units si the closest si unit is the nanometre 6991100000000000000 10 9 m the international committee for weights and measures officially discourages its use and it is not included in the european union s catalogue of units of measure that may be used within its internal market 13 symbol edit example of the unicode codification for compatibility reasons unicode includes the formal symbol at u 212b angstrom sign html 8491 however the ngstr m sign is also normalized into u 00c5 latin capital letter a with ring above html 197 aring 14 the unicode consortium recommends to use the regular letter 00c5 before digital typesetting the ngstr m or ngstr m unit was sometimes written as a u also an abbreviation of the astronomical unit this use is evident in bragg s paper on the structure of ice 15 which gives the c- and a-axis lattice constants as 4.52 a u and 7.34 a u respectively see also edit look up ngstr m in wiktionary the free dictionary 100 picometres
