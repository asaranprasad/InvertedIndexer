arthur schuster john william graham sir arthur stanley eddington om frs 2 28 december 1882 22 november 1944 was an english astronomer physicist and mathematician of the early 20th century who did his greatest work in astrophysics he was also a philosopher of science and a populariser of science the eddington limit the natural limit to the luminosity of stars or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object is named in his honour around 1920 he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars in his paper the internal constitution of the stars 3 4 at that time the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery eddington was the first to correctly speculate that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium he is famous for his work concerning the theory of relativity eddington wrote a number of articles that announced and explained einstein s theory of general relativity to the english-speaking world world war i severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in german science were not well known in england he also conducted an expedition to observe the solar eclipse of 29 may 1919 that provided one of the earliest confirmations of general relativity and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory contents 1 early years 2 astronomy 2.1 dispute with chandrasekhar on

further reading early years edit eddington was born 28 december 1882 in kendal westmorland now cumbria england the son of quaker parents arthur henry eddington headmaster of the quaker school and sarah ann shout 5 his father taught at a quaker training college in lancashire before moving to kendal to become headmaster of stramongate school he died in the typhoid epidemic which swept england in 1884 his mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income the family moved to weston-super-mare where at first stanley as his mother and sister always called eddington was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school the family lived at a house called varzin 42 walliscote road weston-super-mare there is a commemorative plaque on the building explaining sir arthur s contribution to science in 1893 eddington entered brynmelyn school he proved to be a most capable scholar particularly in mathematics and english literature his performance earned him a scholarship to owens college manchester what was later to become the university of manchester in 1898 which he was able to attend having turned 16 that year he spent the first year in a general course but turned to physics for the next three years eddington was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers arthur schuster and horace lamb at manchester eddington lived at dalton hall where he came under the lasting influence of the quaker mathematician j w graham his progress was rapid winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a b sc in physics with first class honours in 1902 based on his performance at owens college he was awarded a scholarship to trinity college cambridge in 1902 his tutor at cambridge was robert alfred herman and in 1904 eddington became the first ever second-year student to be placed as senior wrangler after receiving his m a in 1905 he began research on thermionic emission in the cavendish laboratory this did not go well and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students this hiatus was brief through a recommendation by e t whittaker his senior colleague at trinity college he secured a position at the royal observatory in greenwich where he was to embark on his career in astronomy a career whose seeds had been sown even as a young child when he would often try to count the stars 6 plaque at 42 walliscote road weston-super-mare astronomy edit in january 1906 eddington was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the astronomer royal at the royal greenwich observatory he left cambridge for greenwich the following month he was put to work on a detailed analysis of the parallax of 433 eros on photographic plates that had started in 1900 he developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars winning him the smith s prize in 1907 the prize won him a fellowship of trinity college cambridge in december 1912 george darwin son of charles darwin died suddenly and eddington was promoted to his chair as the plumian professor of astronomy and experimental philosophy in early 1913 later that year robert ball holder of the theoretical lowndean chair also died and eddington was named the director of the entire cambridge observatory the next year in may 1914 he was elected a fellow of the royal society and won their royal medal in 1928 and delivered their bakerian lecture in 1926 7 eddington also investigated the interior of stars through theory and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes he began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for cepheid variable stars he began by extending karl schwarzschild s earlier work on radiation pressure in emden polytropic models these models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure and one of eddington s chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere he developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior however his results allowed for calculation of temperature density and pressure at all points inside a star and eddington argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics james jeans contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be ionized but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair who became famous for their lively debates eddington defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results particularly his important mass-luminosity relation this had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars including giants and dwarfs behaved as ideal gases in the process of developing his stellar models he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy jeans and others defended the kelvin helmholtz mechanism which was based on classical mechanics while eddington speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes around 1920 he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars in his paper the internal constitution of the stars 3 4 at that time the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium liberating enormous energy according to einstein s equation e mc2 this was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy and even that stars are largely composed of hydrogen see metallicity had not yet been discovered eddington s paper based on knowledge at the time reasoned that the leading theory of stellar energy the contraction hypothesis should cause stars rotation to visibly speed up due to conservation of angular momentum but observations of cepheid variable stars showed this was not happening the only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy francis aston had also recently shown that the mass of a helium atom was about 0.8 less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would combined form a helium atom suggesting that if such a combination could happen it would release considerable energy as a byproduct if a star contained just 5 of fusible hydrogen it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy we now know that most ordinary stars contain far more than 5 hydrogen further elements might also be fused and other scientists had speculated that stars were the crucible in which light elements combined to create heavy elements but without more accurate measurements of their atomic masses nothing more could be said at the time all of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades with these assumptions he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees in 1924 he discovered the mass-luminosity relation for stars see lecchini in external links and references despite some disagreement eddington s models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation particularly in issues of stellar evolution the confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by michelson in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to eddington s intuitive exploratory style eddington s theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as the internal constitution of the stars which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists eddington s work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure and precipitated further clashes with jeans and edward arthur milne an important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in quantum physics including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars dispute with chandrasekhar on existence of black holes edit the topic of extension of his models precipitated his famous dispute with subrahmanyan chandrasekhar who was then a student at cambridge chandrasekhar s work presaged the discovery of black holes which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that eddington refused to believe that chandrasekhar s purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world history clearly proved eddington wrong but his motivation remains a matter of some controversy chandrasekhar s narrative of this incident in which his work is harshly rejected portrays eddington as rather cruel dogmatic and racist eddington s criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain away the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars 8 relativity edit during world war i eddington was secretary of the royal astronomical society which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from willem de sitter regarding einstein s theory of general relativity eddington was fortunate in being not only one of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity but owing to his internationalist and pacifist views inspired by his quaker religious beliefs 6 9 one of the few at the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a german physicist he quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in britain he and astronomer royal frank watson dyson organized two expeditions to observe a solar eclipse in 1919 to make the first empirical test of einstein s theory the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun s gravitational field in fact dyson s argument for the indispensability of eddington s expertise in this test was what prevented eddington from eventually having to enter military service 6 9 when conscription was introduced in britain on 2 march 1916 eddington intended to apply for an exemption as a conscientious objector 6 cambridge university authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of eddington s work being of national interest in 1918 this was appealed against by the ministry of national service before the appeal tribunal in june eddington claimed conscientious objector status which was not recognized and would have ended his exemption in august 1918 a further two hearings took place in june and july respectively eddington s personal statement at the june hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record 6 astronomer royal sir frank dyson supported eddington at the july hearing with a written statement emphasising eddington s essential role in the solar eclipse expedition to principe in may 1919 eddington made clear his willingness to serve in the friends ambulance unit the red cross or as a harvest labourer however the tribunal s decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of eddington continuing his astronomy work in particular in preparation for the principe expedition 6 9 the war ended before the end of his exemption one of eddington s photographs of the total solar eclipse of 29 may 1919 presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success confirming einstein s theory that light bends after the war eddington travelled to the island of pr ncipe off the west coast of africa to watch the solar eclipse of 29 may 1919 during the eclipse he took pictures of the stars several stars in the hyades cluster include kappa tauri of the constellation taurus in the region around the sun 10 according to the theory of general relativity stars with light rays that passed near the sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field this effect is noticeable only during eclipses since otherwise the sun s brightness obscures the affected stars eddington showed that newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by einstein eddington s observations published the next year 10 confirmed einstein s theory and were hailed at the time as a conclusive proof of general relativity over the newtonian model the news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story afterward eddington embarked on a campaign to popularize relativity and the expedition as landmarks both in scientific development and international scientific relations it has been claimed that eddington s observations were of poor quality and he had unjustly discounted simultaneous observations at sobral brazil which appeared closer to the newtonian model but a 1979 re-analysis with modern measuring equipment and contemporary software validated eddington s results and conclusions 11 the quality of the 1919 results was indeed poor compared to later observations but was sufficient to persuade contemporary astronomers the rejection of the results from the brazil expedition was due to a defect in the telescopes used which again was completely accepted and well understood by contemporary astronomers 12 throughout this period eddington lectured on relativity and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific he collected many of these into the mathematical theory of relativity in 1923 which albert einstein suggested was the finest presentation of the subject in any language he was an early advocate of einstein s general relativity and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment ludwik silberstein a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity approached eddington at the royal society s 6 november 1919 meeting where he had defended einstein s relativity with his brazil-principe solar eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism and ruefully charged arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory silberstein of course was including himself and einstein as the other when eddington refrained from replying he insisted arthur not be so shy whereupon eddington replied oh no i was wondering who the third one might be 13 cosmology edit eddington was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models he had been investigating the instability of the einstein universe when he learned of both lema tre s 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and hubble s work on the recession on the spiral nebulae he felt the cosmological constant must have played the crucial role in the universe s evolution from an einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant s significance and characteristics in the mathematical theory of relativity eddington interpreted the cosmological constant to mean that the universe is self-gauging fundamental theory and the eddington number edit during the 1920s until his death eddington increasingly concentrated on what he called fundamental theory which was intended to be a unification of quantum theory relativity cosmology and gravitation at first he progressed along traditional lines but turned increasingly to an almost numerological analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants his basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number in many cases these would result in numbers close to 1040 its square or its square root he was convinced that the mass of the proton and the charge of the electron were a natural and complete specification for constructing a universe and that their values were not accidental one of the discoverers of quantum mechanics paul dirac also pursued this line of investigation which has become known as the dirac large numbers hypothesis and some scientists even today believe it has something to it citation needed a somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the fine structure constant at the time it was measured to be very close to 1 136 and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1 136 for epistemological reasons later measurements placed the value much closer to 1 137 at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the degrees of freedom so that the value should in fact be exactly 1 137 the eddington number wags at the time started calling him arthur adding-one 14 citation needed this change of stance detracted from eddington s credibility in the physics community the is estimated at 1 137.035 999 074 44 eddington believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics which he termed e-numbers representing a certain group a clifford algebra these in effect incorporated spacetime into a higher-dimensional structure while his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a grand unified theory moreover eddington s emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them is nowadays a central concern of physics in particular he predicted a number of hydrogen atoms in the universe 136 2256 or equivalently the half of the total number of particles protons electrons 15 when equalized with the non-dark energy equivalent number of hydrogen atoms 16 3 10 rc2 gmh this corresponds to a universe radius r 13.8 giga light year a value predicted for years from universal constants using an atomic-cosmic symmetry 17 and compatible with c times the so-called age of the universe 13.80 4 gyr as determined by the planck mission in march 2003 he did not complete this line of research before his death in 1944 his book fundamental theory was published posthumously in 1948 eddington number for cycling edit eddington is credited with devising a measure of a cyclist s long-distance riding achievements the eddington number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number e such that the cyclist has cycled e miles on e days 18 19 for example an eddington number of 70 would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on 70 occasions achieving a high eddington number is difficult since moving from say 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning eddington s own e-number was 84 20 the eddington number for cycling is analogous to the h-index that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist it should be noted that the eddington number for cycling has units indeed applying it to any physical property will result in e having units for example an e of 62 miles means a cyclist has covered 62 or more miles on 62 or more days however in units of kilometers the 62 miles becomes 100 km it is possible that the cyclist while having covered 100 km on 62 days or more may not have covered 100 km on 100 days or more thus the order of bicyclists may change depending on units used using the original miles one cyclist may have an eddington number of 60 60 miles 97 km in 55 days another of 50 corresponding to 80 km however the latter may be a regular on a distance like this and get a km-eddington of 80 while the former only had those 60 days riding and thus stays at a km-eddington of 60 philosophy edit idealism edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message eddington wrote in his book the nature of the physical world that the stuff of the world is mind-stuff the mind-stuff of the world is of course something more general than our individual conscious minds the mind-stuff is not spread in space and time these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it it is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness consciousness is not sharply defined but fades into subconsciousness and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature it is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character but no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience and all else is remote inference eddington the nature of the physical world 276 81 the idealist conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments the first derives directly from current physical theory briefly mechanical theories of the ether and of the behaviour of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics from this eddington inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that in consequence since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive an idealistic metaphysics is required the second and more interesting argument was based on eddington s epistemology and may be regarded as consisting of two parts first all we know of the objective world is its structure and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness we therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is mind-stuff dualistic metaphysics then cannot be evidentially supported but second not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material to conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world however this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties but this is absurd for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness and consequently nonmaterial ian barbour in his book issues in science and religion 1966 p 133 cites eddington s the nature of the physical world 1928 for a text that argues the heisenberg uncertainty principles provides a scientific basis for the defense of the idea of human freedom and his science and the unseen world 1929 for support of philosophical idealism the thesis that reality is basically mental charles de koninck points out that eddington believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds but was using the phrase mind-stuff to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world that our minds and the physical world are made of the same stuff and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world 21 as de koninck quotes eddington there is a doctrine well known to philosophers that the moon ceases to exist when no one is looking at it i will not discuss the doctrine since i have not the least idea what is the meaning of the word existence when used in this connection at any rate the science of astronomy has not been based on this spasmodic kind of moon in the scientific world which has to fulfill functions less vague than merely existing there is a moon which appeared on the scene before the astronomer it reflects sunlight when no one sees it it has mass when no one is measuring the mass it is distant 240,000 miles from the earth when no one is surveying the distance and it will eclipse the sun in 1999 even if the human race has succeeded in killing itself off before that date eddington the nature of the physical world 226 indeterminism edit against albert einstein and others who advocated determinism indeterminism championed by eddington 21 says that a physical object has an ontologically undetermined component that is not due to the epistemological limitations of physicists understanding the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics then would not necessarily be due to hidden variables but to an indeterminism in nature itself popular and philosophical writings edit eddington wrote a clever parody of the rubaiyat of omar khayyam 22 recounting his 1919 solar eclipse experiment it contained the following quatrain 23 oh leave the wise our measures to collate one thing at least is certain light has weight one thing is certain and the rest debate light-rays when near the sun do not go straight during the 1920s and 30s eddington gave numerous lectures interviews and radio broadcasts on relativity in addition to his textbook the mathematical theory of relativity and later quantum mechanics many of these were gathered into books including the nature of the physical world and new pathways in science his skillful use of literary allusions and humour helped make these famously difficult subjects quite accessible eddington s books and lectures were immensely popular with the public not only because of eddington s clear and entertaining exposition but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics he argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism and also that the positivist nature of modern physics i e relativity and quantum physics provided new room for personal religious experience and free will unlike many other spiritual scientists he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions he is sometimes misunderstood as having promoted the infinite monkey theorem in his 1928 book the nature of the physical world with the phrase if an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters they might write all the books in the british museum it is clear from the context that eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration on the contrary it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability the term improbable is functionally equivalent to impossible his popular writings made him quite literally a household name in great britain between the world wars death edit eddington died of cancer in the evelyn nursing
