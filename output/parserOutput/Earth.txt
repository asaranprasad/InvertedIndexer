climate-variable earth is the third planet from the sun and the only object in the universe known to harbor life according to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence earth formed over 4 billion years ago 24 25 26 earth s gravity interacts with other objects in space especially the sun and the moon earth s only natural satellite earth revolves around the sun in 365.26 days a period known as an earth year during this time earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times n 5 earth s axis of rotation is tilted producing seasonal variations on the planet s surface 27 the gravitational interaction between the earth and moon causes ocean tides stabilizes the earth s orientation on its axis and gradually slows its rotation 28 earth is the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets earth s lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years about 71 of earth s surface is covered with water mostly by oceans 29 the remaining 29 is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere the majority of earth s polar regions are covered in ice including the antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the arctic ice pack earth s interior remains active with a solid iron inner core a liquid outer core that generates the earth s magnetic field and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics within the first billion years of earth s history life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the earth s atmosphere and surface leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago since then the combination of earth s distance from the sun physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive 30 31 in the history of the earth biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events over 99 of all species 32 that ever lived on earth are extinct 33 34 estimates of the number of species on earth today vary widely 35 36 37 most species have not been described 38 over 7.6 billion humans live on earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival

often spelled eor e 39 it has cognates in every germanic language and their proto-germanic root has been reconstructed as er in its earliest appearances eor e was already being used to translate the many senses of latin terra and greek g the ground n 7 its soil n 8 dry land n 9 the human world n 10 the surface of the world including the sea n 11 and the globe itself n 12 as with terra and gaia earth was a personified goddess in germanic paganism the angles were listed by tacitus as among the devotees of nerthus 48 and later norse mythology included j r a giantess often given as the mother of thor 49 originally earth was written in lowercase and from early middle english its definite sense as the globe was expressed as the earth by early modern english many nouns were capitalized and the earth became and often remained the earth particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies more recently the name is sometimes simply given as earth by analogy with the names of the other planets 39 house styles now vary oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common with the capitalized form an acceptable variant another convention capitalizes earth when appearing as a name e g earth s atmosphere but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the e g the atmosphere of the earth it almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as what on earth are you doing 50 chronology formation artist s impression of the early solar system s planetary disk the oldest material found in the solar system is dated to 7000456720000000000 4.5672 0.0006 billion years ago bya 51 by 7000454000000000000 4.54 0.04 bya 52 the primordial earth had formed the formation and evolution of solar system bodies occurred along with the sun in theory a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk and then the planets grow out of that disk along with the sun a nebula contains gas ice grains and dust including primordial nuclides according to nebular theory planetesimals formed by accretion with the primordial earth taking 10 7001200000000000000 20 million years mys to form 53 a subject of research is the formation of the moon some 4.53 bya 54 a working hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from earth after a mars-sized object named theia hit earth 55 in this view the mass of theia was approximately 10 percent of earth 56 it hit earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with earth 57 between approximately 4.1 and 7000380000000000000 3.8 bya numerous asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the moon and by inference to that of earth geological history hoodoos at the bryce canyon national park utah earth s atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor the origin of the world s oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids protoplanets and comets 58 in this model atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming sun had only 70 of its current luminosity 59 by 7000350000000000000 3.5 bya earth s magnetic field was established which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind 60 a crust formed when the molten outer layer of earth cooled to form a solid the two models 61 that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms 62 or more likely a rapid growth 63 early in earth history 64 followed by a long-term steady continental area 65 66 67 continents formed by plate tectonics a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from earth s interior on time scales lasting hundreds of millions of years the supercontinents have assembled and broken apart roughly 7002750000000000000 750 million years ago mya one of the earliest known supercontinents rodinia began to break apart the continents later recombined to form pannotia 600 7002540000000000000 540 mya then finally pangaea which also broke apart 7002180000000000000 180

phylogenetic tree of life on earth based on rrna analysis chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago a half billion years later the last common ancestor of all life arose 70 the evolution of photosynthesis allowed the sun s energy to be harvested directly by life forms the resultant molecular oxygen o2 accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation formed a protective ozone layer o3 in the upper atmosphere 71 the incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes 72 true multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer life

has been termed snowball earth and it is of particular interest because it preceded the cambrian explosion when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity 78 following the cambrian explosion 7002535000000000000 535 mya there have been five mass extinctions 79 the most recent such event was 7001660000000000000 66 mya when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles but spared some small animals such as mammals which at the time resembled shrews mammalian life has diversified over the past 7001660000000000000 66 mys and several million years ago an african ape-like animal such as orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright 80 this facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain which led to the evolution of humans the development of agriculture and then civilization led to humans having an influence on earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day 81 future earth s expected long-term future is tied to that of the sun over the next 7000110000000000000 1.1 bys solar luminosity will

animal life will become extinct 84 after another billion years all surface water will have disappeared 85 and the mean global temperature will reach 7002343150000000000 70 c 84 7002343150000000000 158 f from that point the earth is expected to be habitable for another 7016157788000000000 500 ma 83 possibly up to 7016725824800000000 2.3 ga if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere 86 even if the sun were eternal and stable 27 of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges 87 the sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 7000500000000000000 5 bys models predict that the sun will expand to roughly 1 au 150 million km 93 million mi which is about 250 times its present radius 82 88 earth s fate is less clear as a red giant the sun will lose roughly 30 of its mass so without tidal effects earth will move to an orbit 1.7 au 250 million km 160 million mi from the sun when the star reaches its maximum radius most if not all remaining life will be destroyed by the sun s increased luminosity peaking at about 5,000 times its present level 82 a 2008 simulation indicates that earth s orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag causing it to enter the sun s atmosphere and be vaporized 88 physical characteristics shape shape of planet earth shown are distances between surface relief and the geocentre the south american andes summits are visible as elevated areas data from the earth2014 89 global relief model the shape of earth is approximately oblate spheroidal due to rotation the earth is flattened along the geographic axis and bulging around the equator 90 the diameter of the earth at the equator is 43 kilometres 27 mi larger than the pole-to-pole diameter 91 thus the point on the surface farthest from earth s center of mass is the summit of the equatorial chimborazo volcano in ecuador 92 93 94 95 the average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres 7,918 mi local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to earth s radius the maximum deviation of only 0.17 is at the mariana trench 10,911 metres 35,797 ft below local sea level whereas mount everest 8,848 metres 29,029 ft above local sea level represents a deviation of 0.14 n 13 in geodesy the exact shape that earth s oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid more precisely the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level

98 99 internal structure earth s interior like that of the other terrestrial planets is divided into layers by their chemical or physical rheological properties the outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle the crust is separated from the mantle by the mohorovi i discontinuity the thickness of the crust varies from about 7003600000000000000 6 km kilometers under the oceans to 30 50 km for the continents the crust and the cold rigid top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 7005660000000000000 660 km below the surface spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle beneath the mantle an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core 100 the earth s inner core might rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet advancing by 0.1 0.5 per year 101 the

a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion about 20 and heat produced through radioactive decay 80 104 the major heat-producing isotopes within earth are potassium-40 uranium-238 and thorium-232 105 at the center the temperature may be up to 6,000 c 10,830 f 106 and the pressure could reach 360 gpa 107 because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay scientists postulate that early in earth s history before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted earth s heat production was much higher at approximately 7016946728000000000 3 ga twice the present-day heat would have been produced increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today 104 108

global heat loss of 4.42 1013 w 110 a portion of the core s thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock these plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts 111 more of the heat in earth is lost through plate tectonics by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges the final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents 112 tectonic plates earth s major plates

mechanically rigid outer layer of earth the lithosphere is divided into pieces called tectonic plates these plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries convergent boundaries at which two plates come together divergent boundaries at which two plates are pulled apart and transform boundaries in which two plates slide past one another laterally earthquakes volcanic activity mountain-building and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries 114 the tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates 115 mountain building occurs when tectonic plates move toward each other forcing rock up the largest mountain on earth is mount everest as the tectonic plates migrate oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries at the same time the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges the combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle due to this recycling most of the ocean floor is less than 7015315576000000000 100 ma old in age the oldest oceanic crust is located in the western pacific and has an estimated age of 7015631152000000000 200 ma 116 117 by comparison the oldest dated continental crust is 7017127177128000000 4030 ma 118 the seven major plates are the pacific north american eurasian african antarctic indo-australian and south american other notable plates include

the total surface area of the earth is about 510 million km2 197 million sq mi 13 of this 70.8 13 or 361.13 million km2 139.43 million sq mi is below sea level and covered by ocean water 121 below the ocean s surface are much of the continental shelf mountains volcanoes 91 oceanic trenches submarine canyons oceanic plateaus abyssal plains and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system the remaining 29.2 or 148.94 million km2 57.51 million sq mi not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains deserts plains plateaus and other landforms tectonics and erosion volcanic eruptions flooding weathering glaciation the growth of coral reefs and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape the earth s surface over geological time 122 123 the continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite less common is basalt a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors 124 sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together nearly 75 of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks although they form about 5 of the crust 125 the third form of rock material found on earth is metamorphic rock which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures high temperatures or both the most abundant silicate minerals on earth s surface include quartz feldspars amphibole mica pyroxene and olivine 126 common carbonate minerals include calcite found in limestone and dolomite 127 the elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of 418 m 1,371 ft at the dead sea to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m 29,029 ft at the top of mount everest the mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m 2,615 ft 128 the pedosphere is the outermost layer of earth s continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes the total arable land is 10.9 of the land surface with 1.3 being permanent cropland 129 130 close to 40 of earth s land surface is used for agriculture or an estimated 16.7 million km2 6.4 million sq mi

distinguishes the blue planet from other planets in the solar system earth s hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans but technically includes all water surfaces in the world including inland seas lakes rivers and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m 6,600 ft the deepest underwater location is challenger deep of the mariana trench in the pacific ocean with a depth of 10,911.4 m 35,799

7003368200000000000 3682 m resulting in an estimated volume of 7018133200000000000 1.332 109 km3 133 if all of earth s crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km 134 135 about 97.5 of the water is saline the remaining 2.5 is fresh water most fresh water about 68.7 is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers 136 the average salinity of earth s oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water 3.5 salt 137 most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks 138 the oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms 139 sea water has an important influence on the world s climate with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir 140 shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts such as the el ni o-southern oscillation 141 atmosphere satellite image of earth cloud cover using nasa s moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer the atmospheric pressure on earth s surface averages 101.325 kpa with a scale height of about 8.5 km 3 it has a composition of 78 nitrogen and 21 oxygen with trace amounts of water vapor carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules the height of the troposphere varies with latitude ranging between 8 km at the poles to 17 km at the equator with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors 142 earth s biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 7000270000000000000 2.7 gya forming the primarily nitrogen oxygen atmosphere of today 71 this change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and indirectly the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric o2 into o3 the ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation permitting life on land 143 other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor providing useful gases causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface and moderating temperature 144 this last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground thereby raising the average temperature water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere without this heat-retention effect the average surface temperature would be 18 c in contrast to the current 15 c 145 and life on earth probably would not exist in its current form 146 in may 2017 glints of light seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere 147 148 weather and climate hurricane felix seen from low earth orbit september 2007 lenticular cloud over an ice pressure ridge near mount discovery antarctica november 2013 massive clouds above the mojave desert february 2016 earth s atmosphere has no definite boundary slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space three-quarters of the atmosphere s mass is contained within the first 11 km 6.8 mi of the surface this lowest layer is called the troposphere energy from the sun heats this layer and the surface below causing expansion of the air this lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler higher-density air the result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy 149 the primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30 latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30 and 60 150 ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions 151 water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm humid air this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation 149 most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes this water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods precipitation patterns vary widely ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter atmospheric circulation topographic features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region 152 the amount of solar energy reaching earth s surface decreases with increasing latitude at higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere as a result the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 c 0.7 f per degree of latitude from the equator 153 earth s surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate ranging from the equator to the polar regions these are the tropical or equatorial subtropical temperate and polar climates 154 this latitudinal rule has several anomalies proximity to oceans moderates the climate for example the scandinavian peninsula has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of northern canada the wind enables this moderating effect the windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side in the northern hemisphere the prevailing wind is west-to-east and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts this is seen in eastern north america and western europe where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean 155 in the southern hemisphere the prevailing wind is east-to-west and the eastern coasts are milder the distance from the earth to the sun varies the earth is closest to the sun at perihelion in january which is summer in the southern hemisphere it is furthest away at aphelion in july which is summer in the northern hemisphere and only 93.55 of the solar radiation from the sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion despite this there are larger land masses in the northern hemisphere which are easier to heat than the seas consequently summers are 2.3 c 4 f warmer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere under similar conditions 156 the climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density the commonly used k ppen climate classification system has five broad groups humid tropics arid humid middle latitudes continental and cold polar which are further divided into more specific subtypes 150 the k ppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation the highest air temperature ever measured on earth was 56.7 c 134.1 f in furnace creek california in death valley in 1913 157 the lowest air temperature ever directly measured on earth was 89.2 c 128.6 f at vostok station in 1983 158 but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as 94.7 c 138.5 f in east antarctica 159 these temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on earth upper atmosphere this view from orbit shows the full moon partially obscured by earth s atmosphere above the troposphere the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere mesosphere and thermosphere 144 each layer has a different lapse rate defining the rate of change in temperature with height beyond these the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind 160 within the stratosphere is the ozone layer a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on earth the k rm n line defined as 100 km above earth s surface is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space 161 thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from earth s gravity this causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases 162 the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of earth s atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere 163 hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on earth 164 in the current oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape instead most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere 165 gravitational field earth s gravity measured by nasa s grace mission showing deviations from the theoretical gravity red shows where gravity is stronger than the smooth standard value and blue shows where it is weaker the gravity of earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the earth near the earth s surface gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m s2 32 ft s2 local differences in topography geology and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in the earth s gravitational field known as gravitational anomalies 166 magnetic field the main part of earth s magnetic field is generated in the core the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy the field extends outwards from the core through the mantle and up to earth s surface where it is approximately a dipole the poles of the dipole are located close to earth s geographic poles at the equator of the magnetic field the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05 10 5 t with global magnetic dipole moment of 7.91 1015 t m3 167 the convection movements in the core are chaotic the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment this causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years the most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago 168 169 magnetosphere schematic of earth s magnetosphere the solar wind flows from left to right the extent of earth s magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere to about 10 earth radii and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail 170 because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind 171 charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as earth rotates 172 173 the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field 174 and the van allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere 170 175 during magnetic storms and substorms charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail directed along field lines into earth s ionosphere where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized causing the aurora 176 orbit and rotation rotation earth s rotation imaged by dscovr epic on 29 may 2016 a few weeks before the solstice earth s rotation period relative to the sun its mean solar day is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time 86,400.0025 si seconds 177 because earth s solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration each day varies between 0 and 2 si ms longer 178 179 earth s rotation period relative to the fixed stars called its stellar day by the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time ut1 or 23h 56m 4.0989s 2 n 18 earth s rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox misnamed its sidereal day is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time ut1 23h 56m 4.0905s 2 thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms 180 the length of the mean solar day in si seconds is available from the iers for the periods 1623 2005 181 and 1962 2005 182 apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in earth s sky is to the west at a rate of 15 h 15 min for bodies near the celestial equator this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the sun or the moon every two minutes from earth s surface the apparent sizes of the sun and the moon are approximately the same 183 184 orbit the pale blue dot photo taken in 1990 by the voyager 1 spacecraft showing earth center right from nearly 6.4 billion km 4 billion mi away earth orbits the sun at an average distance of about 150 million km 93 million mi every 365.2564 mean solar days or one sidereal year this gives an apparent movement of the sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1 day which is one apparent sun or moon diameter every 12 hours due to this motion on average it takes 24 hours a solar day for earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the sun returns to the meridian the orbital speed of earth averages about 29.78 km s 107,200 km h 66,600 mph which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to earth s diameter about 12,742 km 7,918 mi in seven minutes and the distance to the moon 384,000 km 239,000 mi in about 3.5 hours 3 the moon and earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars when combined with the earth moon system s common orbit around the sun the period of the synodic month from new moon to new moon is 29.53 days viewed from the celestial north pole the motion of earth the moon and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the sun and earth earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the sun the orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned earth s axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the earth sun plane the ecliptic and the earth moon plane is tilted up to 5.1 degrees against the earth sun plane without this tilt there would be an eclipse every two weeks alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses 3 185 the hill sphere or the sphere of gravitational influence of the earth is about 1.5 10 6 km 930,000 mi in radius 186 n 19 this is the maximum distance at which the earth s gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant sun and planets objects must orbit the earth within this radius or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the sun earth along with the solar system is situated in the milky way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center it is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the orion arm 187 axial tilt and seasons earth s axial tilt or obliquity and its relation to the rotation axis and plane of orbit the axial tilt of the earth is approximately 23.439281 2 with the axis of its orbit plane always pointing towards the celestial poles due to earth s axial tilt the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year this causes the seasonal change in climate with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the tropic of cancer is facing the sun and winter taking place when the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere faces the sun during the summer the day lasts longer and the sun climbs higher in the sky in winter the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter in northern temperate latitudes the sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice and sets north of true west reversing in the winter the sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west above the arctic circle an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year up to six months at the north pole itself a polar night in the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed with the south pole oriented opposite the direction of the north pole six months later this pole will experience a midnight sun a day of 24 hours again reversing with the south pole by astronomical convention the four seasons can be determined by the solstices the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the sun and the equinoxes when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the sun are perpendicular in the northern hemisphere winter solstice currently occurs around 21 december summer solstice is near 21 june spring equinox is around 20 march and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 september in the southern hemisphere the situation is reversed with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped 188 the angle of earth s axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time its axial tilt does undergo nutation a slight irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years 189 the orientation rather than the angle of earth s axis also changes over time precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800 year cycle this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the sun and the moon on earth s equatorial bulge the poles also migrate a few meters across earth s surface this polar motion has multiple cyclical components which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion in addition to an annual component to this motion there is a 14-month cycle called the chandler wobble earth s rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation 190 in modern times earth s perihelion occurs around 3 january and its aphelion around 4 july these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles the changing earth sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9 n 20 in solar energy reaching earth at perihelion relative to aphelion because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that earth reaches the closest approach to the sun the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere 191 a study from 2016 suggested that planet nine tilted all solar system planets including earth s by about six degrees 192 habitability the rocky mountains in canada overlook moraine lake a planet that can sustain life is termed habitable even if life did not originate there earth provides liquid water an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism 193 the distance of earth from the sun as well as its orbital eccentricity rate of rotation axial tilt geological history sustaining atmosphere and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface 194 biosphere a planet s life forms inhabit ecosystems whose total is sometimes said to form a biosphere earth s biosphere is thought to have begun evolving about 7000350000000000000 3.5 gya 71 the biosphere is divided into a number of biomes inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals on land biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude height above sea level and humidity terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic or antarctic circles at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes 195 in july 2016 scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor luca of all

timescales large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from earth s crust consisting of coal petroleum and natural gas these deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis resulting from actions of magmatism erosion and plate tectonics 198 these bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements earth s biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans including food wood pharmaceuticals oxygen and the recycling of many organic wastes the land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land 199 in 1980 50.53 million km2 19.51 million sq mi of earth s land surface consisted of forest and woodlands 67.88 million km2 26.21 million sq mi was grasslands and pasture and 15.01 million km2 5.80 million sq mi was cultivated

environmental hazards a volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere large areas of earth s surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical cyclones hurricanes or typhoons that dominate life in those areas from 1980 to 2000 these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year 201 many places are subject to earthquakes landslides tsunamis volcanic eruptions tornadoes sinkholes blizzards floods droughts wildfires and other calamities and disasters many localized areas are subject to human-made pollution of the air and water acid rain and toxic substances loss of vegetation overgrazing deforestation desertification loss of wildlife species extinction soil degradation soil depletion and erosion there is a scientific consensus linking human activities to global warming due

sovereign government with authority over the entire globe although some nation-states have striven for world domination and failed 210 the united nations is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations thereby avoiding armed conflict 211 the u n serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law when the consensus of the membership permits it provides a mechanism for armed intervention 212 the first human to orbit earth was yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961 213 in total about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of 30 july 2010 and of these twelve have walked on the moon 214 215 216 normally the only humans in space are those on the international space station the station s crew made up of six people is usually replaced every six months 217 the farthest that humans have traveled from earth is 400,171 km achieved during the apollo 13 mission in 1970 218 moon characteristics diameter 3,474.8 km mass 7.349 1022 kg semi-major axis 384,400 km orbital period 27 d 7 h 43.7 m the moon is a relatively large terrestrial planet-like natural satellite with a diameter about one-quarter of earth s it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet although charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto the natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as moons after earth s the gravitational attraction between earth and the moon causes tides on earth the same effect on the moon has led to its tidal locking its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit earth as a result it always presents the same face to the planet as the moon orbits earth different parts of its face are illuminated by the sun leading to the lunar phases the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator details of the earth moon system showing the radius of each object and the earth moon barycenter the moon s axis is located by cassini s third law due to their tidal interaction the moon recedes from earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm yr over millions of years these tiny modifications and the lengthening of earth s day by about 23 s yr add up to significant changes 219 during the devonian period for example approximately 7002410000000000000 410 mya there were 400 days in a year with each day lasting 21.8 hours 220 the moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet s climate paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that earth s axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the moon 28 some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the sun and planets to earth s equatorial bulge the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years as appears to be the case for mars 221 viewed from earth the moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the sun the angular size or solid angle of these two bodies match because although the sun s diameter is about 400 times as large as the moon s it is also 400 times more distant 184 this allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on earth the most widely accepted theory of the moon s origin the giant-impact hypothesis states that it formed from the collision of a mars-size protoplanet called theia with the early earth this hypothesis explains among other things the moon s relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of earth s crust 222 asteroids and artificial satellites tracy caldwell dyson viewing earth from the iss cupola 2010 earth has at least five co-orbital

astronomical symbol of earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle 228 representing the four corners of the world human cultures have developed many views of the planet earth is sometimes personified as a deity in many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity 229 and by the mid-20th century the gaia principle compared earth s environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability 230 231 232 creation myths in many religions involve the creation of earth by a supernatural deity or deities 229 scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people s view of the planet in the west belief in a flat earth 233 was displaced by the idea of spherical earth credited to pythagoras in the 6th century bc 234 earth was further believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object comparable to the other planets in the solar system 235 due to the efforts of influential christian scholars and clerics such as james ussher who sought to determine the age of earth through analysis of genealogies in scripture westerners before the 19th century generally believed earth to be a few thousand years old at most it was only during the 19th century that geologists realized earth s age was at least many millions of years 236 lord kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864 sparking a vigorous debate on the subject it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining earth s age was established proving the planet to be billions of years old 237 238 the perception of earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit and especially with photographs of earth
