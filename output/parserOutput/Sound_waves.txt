sound - wikipedia sound from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from sound waves jump to navigation search a drum produces sound via a vibrating membrane in physics sound is a vibration that typically propagates as an audible wave of pressure through a transmission medium such as a gas liquid or solid in human physiology and psychology sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain 1 humans can hear sound waves with frequencies between about 20 hz and 20 khz sound above 20 khz is ultrasound and below 20 hz is infrasound different animal species have

interdisciplinary science that deals with the study of mechanical waves in gases liquids and solids including vibration sound ultrasound and infrasound a scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustical engineering may be called an acoustical engineer 2 an audio engineer on the other hand is concerned with the recording manipulation mixing and reproduction of sound applications of acoustics are found in almost all aspects of modern society subdisciplines include aeroacoustics audio signal processing architectural acoustics bioacoustics electro-acoustics environmental noise musical acoustics noise control psychoacoustics speech ultrasound underwater acoustics and vibration 3 definition edit sound is defined as a oscillation in pressure stress particle displacement particle velocity etc propagated in a medium with internal forces e g elastic or viscous or the superposition of such propagated oscillation b auditory sensation evoked by the oscillation described in a 4 sound can be viewed as a wave motion in air or other elastic media in this case sound is a stimulus sound can also be viewed as an excitation of the hearing mechanism that results in the perception of sound in this case sound is a sensation physics of sound edit play media experiment using two tuning forks oscillating usually at the same frequency one of the forks is being hit with a rubberized mallet although the first tuning fork hasn t been hit while the other fork is visibly excited due to the oscillation caused by the periodic change in the pressure and density of the air by hitting the other fork creating an acoustic resonance between the forks however if we place a piece of metal on a prong we see that the effect dampens and the excitations become less and less pronounced as resonance isn t achieved as effectively sound can propagate through a medium such as air water and solids as longitudinal waves and also as a transverse wave in solids see longitudinal and transverse waves below the sound waves are generated by a sound source such as the vibrating diaphragm of a stereo speaker the sound source creates vibrations in the surrounding medium as the source continues to vibrate the medium the vibrations propagate away from the source at the speed of sound thus forming the sound wave at a fixed distance from the source the pressure velocity and displacement of the medium vary in time at an instant in time the pressure velocity and displacement vary in space note that the particles of the medium do not travel with the sound wave this is intuitively obvious for a solid and the same is true for liquids and gases that is the vibrations of particles in the gas or liquid transport the vibrations while the average position of the particles over time does not change during propagation waves can be reflected refracted or attenuated by the medium 5 the behavior of sound propagation is generally affected by three things a complex relationship between the density and pressure of the medium this relationship affected by temperature determines the speed of sound within the medium motion of the medium itself if the medium is moving this movement may increase or decrease the absolute speed of the sound wave depending on the direction of the movement for example sound moving through wind will have its speed of propagation increased by the speed of the wind if the sound and wind are moving in the same direction if the sound and wind are moving in opposite directions the speed of the sound wave will be decreased by the speed of the wind the viscosity of the medium medium viscosity determines the rate at which sound is attenuated for many media such as air or water attenuation due to viscosity is negligible when sound is moving through a medium that does not have constant physical properties it may be refracted either dispersed or focused 5 spherical compression longitudinal waves the mechanical vibrations that can be interpreted as sound can travel through all forms of matter gases liquids solids and plasmas the matter that supports the sound is called the medium sound cannot travel through a vacuum 6 7 longitudinal and transverse waves edit sound is transmitted through gases plasma and liquids as longitudinal waves also called compression waves it requires a medium to propagate through solids however it can be transmitted as both longitudinal waves and transverse waves longitudinal sound waves are waves of alternating pressure deviations from the equilibrium pressure causing local regions of compression and rarefaction while transverse waves in solids are waves of alternating shear stress at right angle to the direction of propagation sound waves may be viewed using parabolic mirrors and objects that produce sound 8 the energy carried by an oscillating sound wave converts back and forth between the potential energy of the extra compression in case of longitudinal waves or lateral displacement strain in case of transverse waves of the matter and the kinetic energy of the displacement velocity of particles of the medium sound wave properties and characteristics edit a pressure over time graph of a 20 ms recording of a clarinet tone demonstrates the two fundamental elements of sound pressure and time sounds can be represented as a mixture of their component sinusoidal waves of different frequencies the bottom waves have higher frequencies than those above the horizontal axis represents time although there are many complexities relating to the transmission of sounds at the point of reception i e the ears sound is readily dividable into two simple elements pressure and time these fundamental elements form the basis of all sound waves they can be used to describe in absolute terms every sound we hear however in order to understand the sound more fully a complex wave such as this is usually separated into its component parts which are a combination of various sound wave frequencies and noise 9 10 11 sound waves are often simplified to a description in terms of sinusoidal plane waves which are characterized by these generic properties frequency or its inverse wavelength amplitude sound pressure or intensity speed of sound direction sound that is perceptible by humans has frequencies from about 20 hz to 20,000 hz in air at standard temperature and pressure the corresponding wavelengths of sound waves range from 17 m to 17 mm sometimes speed and direction are combined as a velocity vector wave number and direction are combined as a wave vector transverse waves also known as shear waves have the additional property polarization and are not a characteristic of sound waves speed of sound edit u s navy f a-18 approaching the speed of sound the white halo is formed by condensed water droplets thought to result from a drop in air pressure around the aircraft see prandtl-glauert singularity 12 the speed of sound depends on the medium the waves pass through and is a fundamental property of the material the first significant effort towards measurement of the speed of sound was made by isaac newton he believed the speed of sound in a particular substance was equal to the square root of the pressure acting on it divided by its density c p displaystyle c sqrt p over rho this was later proven wrong when found to incorrectly derive the speed the french mathematician laplace corrected the formula by deducing that the phenomenon of sound travelling is not isothermal as believed by newton but adiabatic he added another factor to the equation gamma and multiplied displaystyle sqrt gamma by p displaystyle sqrt p over rho thus coming up with the equation c p displaystyle c sqrt gamma cdot p over rho since k p displaystyle k gamma cdot p the final equation came up to be c k displaystyle c sqrt frac k rho which is also known as the newton-laplace equation in this equation k elastic bulk modulus c velocity of sound and displaystyle rho density thus the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the bulk modulus of the medium to its density those physical properties and the speed of sound change with ambient conditions for example the speed of sound in gases depends on temperature in 20 c 68 f air at sea level the speed of sound is approximately 343 m s 1,230 km h 767 mph using the formula v 331 0.6 t m s in fresh water also at 20 c the speed of sound is approximately 1,482 m s 5,335 km h 3,315 mph in steel the speed of sound is about 5,960 m s 21,460 km h 13,330 mph the speed of sound is also slightly sensitive being subject to a second-order anharmonic effect to the sound amplitude which means there are non-linear propagation effects such as the production of harmonics and mixed tones not present in the original sound see parametric array perception of sound edit a distinct use of the term sound from its use in physics is that in physiology and psychology where the term refers to the subject of perception by the brain the field of psychoacoustics is dedicated to such studies historically the word sound referred exclusively to an effect in the mind webster s 1947 dictionary defined sound as that which is heard the effect which is produced by the vibration of a body affecting the ear 13 this meant at least in 1947 the correct response to the question if a tree falls in the forest with no one to hear it fall does it make a sound was no however owing to contemporary usage definitions of sound as a physical effect are prevalent in most dictionaries consequently the answer to the same question is now yes a tree falling in the forest with no one to hear it fall does make a sound the physical reception of sound in any hearing organism is limited to a range of frequencies humans normally hear sound frequencies between approximately 20 hz and 20,000 hz 20 khz 14 382 the upper limit decreases with age 14 249 sometimes sound refers to only those vibrations with frequencies that are within the hearing range for humans 15 or sometimes it relates to a particular animal other species have different ranges of hearing for example dogs can perceive vibrations higher than 20 khz as a signal perceived by one of the major senses sound is used by many species for detecting danger navigation predation and communication earth s atmosphere water and virtually any physical phenomenon such as fire rain wind surf or earthquake produces and is characterized by its unique sounds many species such as frogs birds marine and terrestrial mammals have also developed special organs to produce sound in some species these produce song and speech furthermore humans have developed culture and technology such as music telephone and radio that allows them to generate record transmit and broadcast sound noise is a term often used to refer to an unwanted sound in science and engineering noise is an undesirable component that obscures a wanted signal however in sound perception it can often be used to identify the source of a sound and is an important component of timbre perception see above soundscape is the component of the acoustic environment that can be perceived by humans the acoustic environment is the combination of all sounds whether audible to humans or not within a given area as modified by the environment and understood by people in context of the surrounding environment there are historically six experimentally separable ways in which sound waves are analysed they are pitch duration loudness timbre sonic texture and spatial location 16 some of these terms have a standardised definition for instance in the ansi acoustical terminology ansi asa s1.1-2013 more recent approaches have also considered temporal envelope env and temporal fine structure tfs as perceptually relevant analyses citation needed pitch edit figure 1 pitch perception pitch is perceived as how low or high a sound is and represents the cyclic repetitive nature of the vibrations that make up sound for simple sounds pitch relates to the frequency of the slowest vibration in the sound called the fundamental harmonic in the case of complex sounds pitch perception can vary sometimes individuals identify different pitches for the same sound based on their personal experience of particular sound patterns selection of a particular pitch is determined by pre-conscious examination of vibrations including their frequencies and the balance between them specific attention is given to recognising potential harmonics 17 18 every sound is placed on a pitch continuum from low to high for example white noise random noise spread evenly across all frequencies sounds higher in pitch than pink noise random noise spread evenly across octaves as white noise has more high frequency content figure 1 shows an example of pitch recognition during the listening process each sound is analysed for a repeating pattern see figure 1 orange arrows and the results forwarded to the auditory cortex as a single pitch of a certain height octave and chroma note name duration edit figure 2 duration perception duration is perceived as how long or short a sound is and relates to onset and offset signals created by nerve responses to sounds the duration of a sound usually lasts from the time the sound is first noticed until the sound is identified as having changed or ceased 19 sometimes this is not directly related to the physical duration of a sound for example in a noisy environment gapped sounds sounds that stop and start can sound as if they are continuous because the offset messages are missed owing to disruptions from noises in the same general bandwidth 20 this can be of great benefit in understanding distorted messages such as radio signals that suffer from interference as owing to this effect the message is heard as if it was continuous figure 2 gives an example of duration identification when a new sound is noticed see figure 2 green arrows a sound onset message is sent to the auditory cortex when the repeating pattern is missed a sound offset messages is sent loudness edit loudness is perceived as how loud or soft a sound is and relates to the totalled number of auditory nerve stimulations over short cyclic time periods most likely over the duration of theta wave cycles 21 22 23 this means that at short durations a very short sound can sound softer than a longer sound even though they are presented at the same intensity level past around 200 ms this is no longer the case and the duration of the sound no longer affects the apparent loudness of the sound figure 3 gives an impression of how loudness information is summed over a period of about 200 ms before being sent to the auditory cortex louder signals create a greater push on the basilar membrane and thus stimulate more nerves creating a stronger loudness signal a more complex signal also creates more nerve firings and so sounds louder for the same wave amplitude than a simpler sound such as a sine wave timbre edit timbre is perceived as the quality of different sounds e g the thud of a fallen rock the whir of a drill the tone of a musical instrument or the quality of a voice and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound e g it s an oboe this identity is based on information gained from frequency transients noisiness unsteadiness perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame 9 10 11 the way a sound changes over time see figure 4 provides most of the information for timbre identification even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4 differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content less noticeable are the different noises heard such as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano figure 3 loudness perception figure 4 timbre perception sonic texture edit sonic texture relates to the number of sound sources and the interaction between them 24 25 the word texture in this context relates to the cognitive separation of auditory objects 26 in music texture is often referred to as the difference between unison polyphony and homophony but it can also relate for example to a busy cafe a sound which might be referred to as cacophony however texture refers to more than this the texture of an orchestral piece is very different to the texture of a brass quintet because of the different numbers of players the texture of a market place is very different to a school hall because of the differences in the various sound sources spatial location edit spatial location see sound localization represents the cognitive placement of a sound in an environmental context including the placement of a sound on both the horizontal and vertical plane the distance from the sound source and the characteristics of the sonic environment 26 27 in a thick texture it is possible to identify multiple sound sources using a combination of spatial location and timbre identification it is the main reason why we can pick the sound of an oboe in an orchestra and the words of a single person at a cocktail party sound pressure

density w sound exposure e sel acoustic impedance z speed of sound c audio frequency af transmission loss tl v t sound pressure is the difference in a given medium between average local pressure and the pressure in the sound wave a square of this difference i e a square of the deviation from the equilibrium pressure is usually averaged over time and or space and a square root of this average provides a root mean square rms value for example 1 pa rms sound pressure 94 dbspl in atmospheric air implies that the actual pressure in the sound wave oscillates between 1 atm 2 displaystyle - sqrt 2 pa and 1 atm 2 displaystyle sqrt 2 pa that is between 101323.6 and 101326.4 pa as the human ear can detect sounds with a wide range of amplitudes sound pressure is often measured as a level on a logarithmic decibel scale the sound pressure level spl or lp is defined as l p 10 log 10 p 2 p r e f 2 20 log 10 p p r e f db displaystyle l mathrm p 10 log 10 left frac p 2 p mathrm ref 2 right 20 log 10 left frac p p mathrm ref right mbox db where p is the root-mean-square sound pressure and p r e f displaystyle p mathrm ref is a reference sound pressure commonly used reference sound pressures defined in the standard ansi s1.1-1994 are 20 pa in air and 1 pa in water without a specified reference sound pressure a value expressed in decibels cannot represent a sound pressure level since the human ear does not have a flat spectral response sound pressures are often frequency weighted so that the measured level matches perceived levels more closely the international electrotechnical commission iec has defined several weighting schemes a-weighting attempts to match the response of the human ear to noise and a-weighted sound pressure levels are labeled dba c-weighting is used to measure peak levels ultrasound edit approximate frequency ranges corresponding to ultrasound with rough guide of some applications ultrasound is sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing ultrasound is no different from normal audible sound in its physical properties except in that humans cannot hear it ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20
