common folk etymology is that the name utah is derived from the name of the ute tribe purported to mean people of the mountains in the ute language 16 this is in fact a false etymology the term is not native in origin and its etymology is unclear in actuality the word for people in ute is n uchiu while the word for mountain is k av i offering no linguistic connection to the words ute or utah 17 according to other sources utah is derived from the apache name yuttahih which means one that is higher up or those that are higher up 16 in the spanish language it was said as yuta subsequently the english-speaking people adapted the word utah 18 history edit pre-columbian edit thousands of years before the arrival of european explorers the ancestral puebloans and the fremont people lived in what is now known as utah some of which spoke languages of the uto-aztecan group ancestral pueblo peoples built their homes through excavations in mountains and the fremont people built houses of straw before disappearing from the region around the 15th century map showing utah in 1838 when it was part of mexico from britannica 7th edition another group of native americans the navajo settled in the region around the 18th century in the mid-18th century other uto-aztecan tribes including the goshute the paiute the shoshone and the ute people also settled in the region these five groups were present when the first european explorers arrived 19 20 spanish exploration 1540 edit the southern utah region was explored by the spanish in 1540 led by francisco v squez de coronado while looking for the legendary c bola a group led by two catholic priests sometimes called the dominguez-escalante expedition left santa fe in 1776 hoping to find a route to the coast of california the expedition traveled as far north as utah lake and encountered the native residents the spanish made further explorations in the region but were not interested in colonizing the area because of its desert nature in 1821 the year mexico achieved its independence from spain the region became known as part of its territory of alta california european trappers and fur traders explored some areas of utah in the early 19th century from canada and the united states the city of provo utah was named for one tienne provost who visited the area in 1825 the city of ogden utah was named after peter skene ogden a canadian explorer who traded furs in the weber valley in late 1824 jim bridger became the first known english-speaking person to sight the great salt lake due to the high salinity of its waters he thought he had found the pacific ocean he subsequently learned this body of water was a giant salt lake after the discovery of the lake hundreds of american and canadian traders and trappers established trading posts in the region in the 1830s thousands of migrants traveling from the eastern united states to the american west began to make stops in the region of the great salt lake then known as lake youta citation needed lds settlement 1847 edit brigham young led the first mormon pioneers to the great salt lake following the death of joseph smith in 1844 brigham young as president of the quorum of the twelve became the effective leader of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints in nauvoo illinois 21 to address the growing conflicts between his people and their neighbors young agreed with illinois governor thomas ford in october 1845 that the mormons would leave by the following year 22 brigham young and the first band of mormon pioneers reached the salt lake valley on july 24 1847 over the next 22 years more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in utah 23 for the first few years brigham young and the thousands of early settlers of salt lake city struggled to survive the arid desert land was deemed by the mormons as desirable as a place where they could practice their religion without harassment the mormon settlements provided pioneers for other settlements in the west salt lake city became the hub of a far-flung commonwealth 24 of mormon settlements with new church converts coming from the east and around the world church leaders often assigned groups of church members as missionaries to establish other settlements throughout the west they developed irrigation to support fairly large pioneer populations along utah s wasatch front salt lake city bountiful and weber valley and provo and utah valley 25 throughout the remainder of the 19th century mormon pioneers established hundreds of other settlements in utah idaho nevada arizona wyoming california canada and mexico including in las vegas nevada franklin idaho the first european settlement in idaho san bernardino california mesa arizona star valley wyoming and carson valley nevada prominent settlements in utah included st george logan and manti where settlers completed the first three temples in utah each started after but finished many years before the larger and better known temple built in salt lake city was completed in 1893 as well as parowan cedar city bluff moab vernal fillmore which served as the territorial capital between 1850 and 1856 nephi levan

smaller towns and settlements young had an expansionist s view of the territory that he and the mormon pioneers were settling calling it deseret which according to the book of mormon was an ancient word for honeybee this is symbolized by the beehive on the utah flag and the state s motto industry 26 utah was mexican territory when the first pioneers arrived in 1847 early in the mexican american war in late 1846 the united states had taken control of new mexico and california the entire southwest became u s territory upon the signing of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo february 2 1848 the treaty was ratified by the united states senate on march 11 learning that california and new mexico were applying for statehood the settlers of the utah area originally having planned to petition for territorial status applied for statehood with an ambitious plan for a state of deseret utah territory 1850 1896 edit salt lake city in 1850 a sketch of salt lake city in 1860 deseret village recreates pioneer life in utah for tourists the golden spike where the first transcontinental railroad was completed in the u s on may 10 1869 in promontory utah the utah territory was much smaller than the proposed state of deseret but it still contained all of the present states of nevada and utah as well as pieces of modern wyoming and colorado 27 it was created with the compromise of 1850 and fillmore named after president millard fillmore was designated the capital the territory was given the name utah after the ute tribe of native americans salt lake city replaced fillmore as the territorial capital in 1856 disputes between the mormon inhabitants and the u s government intensified due to the practice of plural marriage or polygamy among members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints the mormons were still pushing for the establishment of a state of deseret with the new borders of the utah territory most if not all of the members of the u s government opposed the polygamous practices of the mormons members of the lds church were viewed as un-american and rebellious when news of their polygamous practices spread in 1857 particularly heinous accusations of abdication of government and general immorality were leveled by former associate justice william w drummond among others the detailed reports of life in utah caused the administration of james buchanan to send a secret military expedition to utah when the supposed rebellion should be quelled alfred cumming would take the place of brigham young as territorial governor the resulting conflict is known as the utah war nicknamed buchanan s blunder by the mormon leaders in september 1857 about 120 american settlers of the baker fancher wagon train en route to california from arkansas were murdered by utah territorial militia and some paiute native americans in the mountain meadows massacre 28 before troops led by albert sidney johnston entered the territory brigham young ordered all residents of salt lake city to evacuate southward to utah valley and sent out a force known as the nauvoo legion to delay the government s advance although wagons and supplies were burned eventually the troops arrived in 1858 and young surrendered official control to cumming although most subsequent commentators claim that young retained true power in the territory a steady stream of governors appointed by the president quit the position often citing the traditions of their supposed territorial government by agreement with young johnston established camp floyd 40 miles 60 km away from salt lake city to the southwest salt lake city was the last link of the first transcontinental telegraph completed in october 1861 brigham young was among the first to send a message along with abraham lincoln and other officials because of the american civil war federal troops were pulled out of utah territory in 1861 this was a boon to the local economy as the army sold everything in camp for pennies on the dollar before marching back east to join the war the territory was then left in lds hands until patrick e connor arrived with a regiment of california volunteers in 1862 connor established fort douglas just 3 miles 4.8 km east of salt lake city and encouraged his people to discover mineral deposits to bring more non-mormons into the territory minerals were discovered in tooele county and miners began to flock to the territory beginning in 1865 utah s black hawk war developed into the deadliest conflict in the territory s history chief antonga black hawk died in 1870 but fights continued to break out until additional federal troops were sent in to suppress the ghost dance of 1872 the war is unique among indian wars because it was a three-way conflict with mounted timpanogos utes led by antonga black hawk fighting federal and lds authorities on may 10 1869 the first transcontinental railroad was completed at promontory summit north of the great salt lake 29 the railroad brought increasing numbers of people into the territory and several influential businesspeople made fortunes there during the 1870s and 1880s laws were passed to punish polygamists due in part to the stories coming forth regarding utah notably ann eliza young tenth wife to divorce brigham young women s advocate national lecturer and author of wife no 19 or my life of bondage and mr and mrs fanny stenhouse authors of the rocky mountain saints t b h stenhouse 1873 and tell it all my life in mormonism fanny stenhouse 1875 both of these women ann eliza and fanny testify to the happiness of the very early church members before polygamy began to be practiced they independently published their books in 1875 these books and the lectures of ann eliza young have been credited with the united states congress passage of anti-polygamy laws by newspapers throughout the united states as recorded in the ann eliza young vindicator a pamphlet which detailed ms young s travels and warm reception throughout her lecture tour t b h stenhouse former utah mormon polygamist mormon missionary for thirteen years and a salt lake city newspaper owner finally left utah and wrote the rocky mountain saints his book gives a witnessed account of his life in utah both the good and the bad he finally left utah and mormonism after financial ruin occurred when brigham young sent stenhouse to relocate to ogden utah according to stenhouse to take over his thriving pro-mormon salt lake telegraph newspaper in addition to these testimonies the confessions of john d lee written by john d lee alleged scape goat for the mountain meadow massacre also came out in 1877 the corroborative testimonies coming out of utah from mormons and former mormons influenced congress and the people of the united states in the 1890 manifesto the lds church banned polygamy when utah applied for statehood again it was accepted one of the conditions for granting utah statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into the state constitution this was a condition required of other western states that were admitted into the union later statehood was officially granted on january 4 1896 20th century edit children reading in santa clara utah in 1940 beginning in the early 20th century with the establishment of such national parks as bryce canyon national park and zion national park utah became known

natural landmarks as delicate arch and the mittens of monument valley 30 during the 1950s 1960s and 1970s with the construction of the interstate highway system accessibility to the southern scenic areas was made easier since the establishment of alta ski area in 1939 and the subsequent development of several ski resorts in the state s mountains utah s skiing has become world-renowned the dry powdery snow of the wasatch range is considered some of the best skiing in the world the state license plate claims the greatest snow on earth 31 32 salt lake city won the bid for the 2002 winter olympic games and this served as a great boost to the economy the ski resorts have increased in popularity and many of the olympic venues built along the wasatch front continue to be used for sporting events preparation for the olympics spurred the development of the light-rail system in the salt lake valley known as trax and the re-construction of the freeway system around the city in 1957 utah created the utah state parks commission with four parks today utah state parks manages 43 parks and several undeveloped areas totaling over 95,000 acres 380 km2 of land and more than 1,000,000 acres

mountain valleys it is a rugged and geographically diverse state that is at the convergence of three distinct geological regions the rocky mountains the great basin and the colorado plateau utah is one of the four corners states and is bordered by idaho in the north wyoming in the north and east by colorado in the east at a single point by new mexico to the southeast by arizona in the south and by nevada in the west it covers an area of 84,899 sq mi 219,890 km2 the state is one of only three u s states with colorado and wyoming that have only lines of latitude and longitude for boundaries one of utah s defining characteristics is the variety of its terrain running down the middle of the state s northern third is the wasatch range which rises to heights of almost 12,000 ft 3,700 m above sea level utah is home to world-renowned ski resorts made popular by the light fluffy snow and winter storms which regularly dump 1 to 3 feet of overnight snow accumulation in the state s northeastern section running east to west are the uinta mountains which rise to heights of over 13,000 feet 4,000 m the highest point in the state kings peak at 13,528 feet 4,123 m 34 lies within the uinta mountains at the western base of the wasatch range is the wasatch front a series of valleys and basins that are home to the most populous parts of the state it stretches approximately from brigham city at the north end to nephi at the south end approximately 75 percent of the state s population lives in this corridor and population growth is rapid western utah is mostly arid desert with a basin and range topography small mountain ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape the bonneville salt flats are an exception being comparatively flat as a result of once forming the bed of ancient lake bonneville great salt lake utah lake sevier lake and rush lake are all remnants of this ancient freshwater lake 35 which once covered most of the eastern great basin west of the great salt lake stretching to the nevada border lies the arid great salt lake desert one exception to this aridity is snake valley which is relatively lush due to large springs and wetlands fed from groundwater derived from snow melt in the snake range deep creek range and other tall mountains to the west of snake valley great basin national park is just over the nevada state line in the southern snake range one of western utah s most impressive but least visited attractions is notch peak the tallest limestone cliff in north america located west of delta much of the scenic southern and southeastern landscape specifically the colorado plateau region is sandstone specifically kayenta sandstone and navajo sandstone the colorado river and its tributaries wind their way through the sandstone creating

semi-arid to desert climate citation needed although its many mountains feature a large variety of climates with the highest points in the uinta mountains being above the timberline the dry weather is a result of the state s location in the rain shadow of the sierra nevada in california the eastern half of the state lies in the rain shadow of the wasatch mountains the primary source of precipitation for the state is the pacific ocean with the state usually lying in the path of large pacific storms from october to may in summer the state especially southern and eastern utah lies in the path of monsoon moisture from the gulf of california most of the lowland areas receive less than 12 inches 305 mm of precipitation annually although the i-15 corridor including the densely populated wasatch front receives approximately 15 inches 381 mm the great salt lake desert is the driest area of the state with less than 5 inches 127 mm snowfall is common in all but the far southern valleys although st george only receives about 3 inches 8 cm per year salt lake city sees about 60 inches 152 cm enhanced by the lake-effect snow from the great salt lake which increases snowfall totals to the south southeast and east of the lake some areas of the wasatch range in the path of the lake-effect receive up to 500 inches 1,270 cm per year this micro climate of enhanced snowfall from the great salt lake spans the entire proximity of the lake the cottonwood canyons adjacent to salt lake city are located in the right position to receive more precipitation from the lake 37 the consistently deep powder snow led utah s ski industry to adopt the slogan the greatest snow on earth in the 1980s in the winter temperature inversions are a common phenomenon across utah s low basins and valleys leading to thick haze and fog that can sometimes last for weeks at a time especially in the uintah basin although at other times of year its air quality is good winter inversions give salt lake city some of the worst wintertime pollution in the country previous studies have indicated a widespread decline in snowpack over utah accompanied by a decline in the snow precipitation ratio while anecdotal evidence claims have been put forward that measured changes in utah s snowpack are spurious and do not reflect actual change a 2012 study 38 found that the proportion of winter january march precipitation falling as snow has decreased by 9 during the last half century a combined result from a significant increase in rainfall and a minor decrease in snowfall meanwhile observed snow depth across utah has decreased and is accompanied by consistent decreases in snow cover and surface albedo weather systems with the potential to produce precipitation in utah have decreased in number with those producing snowfall decreasing at a considerably greater rate 39 snow in rose park salt lake city utah s temperatures are extreme with cold temperatures in winter due to its elevation and very hot summers statewide with the exception of mountain areas and high mountain valleys utah is usually protected from major blasts of cold air by mountains lying north and east of the state although major arctic blasts can occasionally reach the state average january high temperatures range from around 30 f 1 c in some northern valleys to almost 55 f 13 c in st george temperatures dropping below 0 f 18 c should be expected on occasion in most areas of the state most years although some areas see it often for example the town of randolph averages about 50 days per year with temperatures dropping that low in july average highs range from about 85 to 100 f 29 to 38 c however the low humidity and high elevation typically leads to large temperature variations leading to cool nights most summer days the record high temperature in utah was 118 f 48 c recorded south of st george on july 4 2007 40 and the record low was 69 f 56 c recorded at peter sinks in the bear river mountains of northern utah on february 1 1985 41 however the record low for an inhabited location is 49 f 45 c at woodruff on december 12 1932 42 utah like most of the western united states has few days of thunderstorms on average there are fewer than 40 days of thunderstorm activity during the year although these storms can be briefly intense when they do occur they are most likely to occur during monsoon season from about mid-july through mid-september especially in southern and eastern utah dry lightning strikes and the general dry weather often spark wildfires in summer while intense thunderstorms can lead to flash flooding especially in the rugged terrain of southern utah although spring is the wettest season in northern utah late summer is the wettest period for much of the south and east of the state tornadoes are uncommon in utah with an average of two striking the state yearly rarely higher than ef1 intensity 43 one exception of note however was the unprecedented f2 salt lake city tornado that moved directly across downtown salt lake city on august 11 1999 killing 1 person injuring 60 others and causing approximately 170 million in damage 44 the only other reported tornado fatality in utah s history was a 7-year-old girl who was killed while camping in summit county on july 6 1884 the last tornado of above e f0 intensity occurred on september 8 2002 when an f2 tornado hit manti on august 11 1993 an f3 tornado hit the uinta mountains north of duchesne at an elevation of 10,500 feet 3,200 m causing some damage to a boy scouts campsite this is the

2016 presidential election the utah state capitol salt lake city the scott matheson courthouse is the seat of the utah supreme court in the late 19th century the federal government took issue with polygamy in the lds church the lds church discontinued plural marriage in 1890 and in 1896 utah gained admission to the union many new people settled the area soon after the mormon pioneers relations have often been strained between the lds population and the non-lds population 120 these tensions have played a large part in utah s history liberal party vs people s party utah votes predominantly republican self-identified latter-day saints are more likely to vote for the republican ticket than non-mormons and utah is one of the most republican states in the nation 121 122 utah was the single most republican-leaning state in the country in every presidential election from 1976 to 2004 measured by the percentage point margin between the republican and democratic candidates in 2008 utah was only the third-most republican state after wyoming and oklahoma but in 2012 with mormon mitt romney atop the republican ticket utah returned to its position as the most republican state however the 2016 presidential election result saw republican donald trump carry the state marking the thirteenth consecutive win by the republican presidential candidate with only a plurality the first time this happened since 1992 both of utah s u s senators orrin hatch and mike lee are republican four more republicans rob bishop chris stewart john curtis and mia love represent utah in the united states house of representatives after jon huntsman jr resigned to serve as u s ambassador to china gary herbert was sworn in as governor on august 11 2009 herbert was elected to serve out the remainder of the term in a special election in 2010 defeating democratic nominee salt lake county mayor peter corroon with 64 of the vote he won election to a full four-year term in 2012 defeating democratic businessman peter cooke with 68 of the vote the lds church maintains an official policy of neutrality with regard to political parties and candidates 73 in the 1970s then-apostle ezra taft benson was quoted by the associated press that it would be difficult for a faithful latter-day saint to be a liberal democrat 123 although the lds church has officially repudiated such statements on many occasions democratic candidates including lds democrats believe that republicans capitalize on the perception that the republican party is doctrinally superior 124 political scientist and pollster dan jones explains this disparity by noting that the national democratic party is associated with liberal positions on gay marriage and abortion both of which the lds church is against 125 the republican party in heavily mormon utah county presents itself as the superior choice for latter-day saints even though utah democratic candidates are predominantly lds socially conservative and pro-life no democrat has won in utah county since 1994 126 david magleby dean of social and behavioral sciences at brigham young university a lifelong democrat and a political analyst asserts that the republican party actually has more conservative positions than the lds church magleby argues that the locally conservative democrats are in better accord with lds doctrine 127 for example the republican party of utah opposes almost all abortions while utah democrats take a more liberal approach although more conservative than their national counterparts on second amendment issues the state gop has been at odds with the lds church position opposing concealed firearms in places of worship and in public spaces in 1998 the church expressed concern that utahns perceived the republican party as an lds
