solar time - wikipedia solar time from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search on a prograde planet like the earth the sidereal day is shorter than the solar day at time 1 the sun and a certain distant star are both overhead at time 2 the planet has rotated 360 and the distant star is overhead again 1 2 one sidereal day but it is not until a little later at time 3 that the sun is overhead again 1 3 one solar day more simply 1-2 is a complete rotation of the earth but because the revolution around the sun affects the angle at which the sun is seen from the earth 1-3 is how long it takes noon to return solar time is a calculation of the passage of time based on the position of the sun in the sky the fundamental unit of solar time is the day two types of solar time are apparent solar time sundial time and mean solar time clock time contents 1 introduction 2 apparent solar time 3 mean solar time 4 history 5 see also 6 references 7 external links introduction a tall pole vertically fixed in the ground casts a shadow on any sunny day at one moment during the day the shadow will point exactly north or south or disappear when and if the sun moves directly overhead that instant is local apparent noon or 12 00 local apparent time about 24 hours later the shadow will again point north south the sun seeming to have covered a 360-degree arc around the earth s axis when the sun has covered exactly 15 degrees 1 24 of a circle both angles being measured in a plane perpendicular to the earth s axis local apparent time is 13 00 exactly after 15 more degrees it will be 14 00 exactly the problem is that in september the sun takes less time as measured by an accurate clock to make an apparent revolution than it does in december 24 hours of solar time can be 21 seconds less or 29 seconds more than 24 hours of clock time as explained in the equation of time article this is due to the eccentricity of the earth s orbit i e the earth s orbit is not perfectly circular meaning that the earth-sun distance varies throughout the year and the fact that the earth s axis is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit the so-called obliquity of the ecliptic the effect of this is that a clock running at a constant rate e g completing the same number of pendulum swings in each hour cannot follow the actual sun instead it follows an imaginary mean sun that moves along the celestial equator at a constant rate that matches the real sun s average rate over the year 1 this is mean solar time which is still not perfectly constant from one century to the next but is close enough for most purposes currently a mean solar day is about 86,400.002 si seconds 2 the two kinds of solar time apparent solar time and mean solar time are among the three kinds of time reckoning that were employed by astronomers until the 1950s the third kind of traditional time reckoning is sidereal time which is based on the apparent motions of stars other than the sun 3 by the 1950s it had become clear that the earth s rotation rate was not constant so astronomers developed ephemeris time a time scale based on the positions of solar system bodies in their orbits apparent solar time the apparent sun is the true sun as seen by an observer on earth 4 apparent solar time or true solar time is based on the apparent motion of the actual sun it is based on the apparent solar day the interval between two successive returns of the sun to the local meridian 5 6 solar time can be crudely measured by a sundial the equivalent on other planets is termed local true solar time ltst 7 8 the length of a solar day varies through the year and the accumulated effect produces seasonal deviations of up to 16 minutes from the mean the effect has two main causes first earth s orbit is an ellipse not a circle so the earth moves faster when it is nearest the sun perihelion and slower when it is farthest from the sun aphelion see kepler s laws of planetary motion second due to earth s axial tilt known as the obliquity of the ecliptic the sun s annual motion is along a great circle the ecliptic that is tilted to earth s celestial equator when the sun crosses the equator at both equinoxes the sun s daily shift relative to the background stars is at an angle to the equator so the projection of this shift onto the equator is less than its average for the year when the sun is farthest from the equator at both solstices the sun s shift in position from one day to the next is parallel to the equator so the projection onto the equator of this shift is larger than the average for the year see tropical year in june and december when the sun is farthest from the celestial equator a given shift along the ecliptic corresponds to a large shift at the equator so apparent solar days are shorter in march and september than in june or december length of apparent solar day 1998 9 date duration in mean solar time february 11 24 hours march 26 24 hours 18.1 seconds may 14 24 hours june 19 24 hours 13.1 seconds july 25 26 24 hours september 16 24 hours 21.3 seconds november 2 3 24 hours december 22 24 hours 29.9 seconds these lengths will change slightly in a few years and significantly in thousands of years mean solar time the equation of time above the axis a sundial will appear fast relative to a clock showing local mean time and below the axis a sundial will appear slow mean solar time is the hour angle of the mean sun plus 12 hours currently 2009 this is realized with the ut1 time scale constructed mathematically from very long baseline interferometry observations of the diurnal motions of radio sources located in other galaxies and other observations 10 11 the duration of daylight varies during the year but the length of a mean solar day is nearly constant unlike that of an apparent solar day 12 an apparent solar day can be 20 seconds shorter or 30 seconds longer than a mean solar day 9 13 long or short days occur in succession so the difference builds up until mean time is ahead of apparent time by about 14 minutes near february 6 and behind apparent time by about 16 minutes near november 3 the equation of time is this difference which is cyclical and does not accumulate from year to year mean time follows the mean sun jean meeus describes the mean sun as follows consider a first fictitious sun travelling along the ecliptic with a constant speed and coinciding with the true sun at the perigee and apogee when the earth is in perihelion and aphelion respectively then consider a second fictitious sun travelling along the celestial equator at a constant speed and coinciding with the first fictitious sun at the equinoxes this second fictitious sun is the mean sun 14 the length of the mean solar day is slowly increasing due to the tidal acceleration of the moon by the earth and the corresponding slowing of earth s rotation by the moon history sun and moon nuremberg chronicle 1493 many methods have been used to simulate mean solar time the earliest were clepsydras or water clocks used for almost four millennia from as early as the middle of the 2nd millennium bc until the early 2nd millennium before the middle of the 1st millennium bc the water clocks were only adjusted to agree with the apparent solar day thus were no better than the shadow cast by a gnomon a vertical pole except that they could be used at night but it has long been known that the sun moves eastward relative to the fixed stars along the ecliptic since the middle of the first millennium bc the diurnal rotation of the fixed stars has been used to determine mean solar time against which clocks were compared to determine their error rate babylonian astronomers knew of the equation of time and were correcting for it as well as the different rotation rate of the stars sidereal time to obtain a mean solar time much more accurate than their water clocks this ideal mean solar time has been used ever since then to describe the motions of the planets moon and sun mechanical clocks did not achieve the accuracy of earth s star clock until the beginning of the 20th century today s atomic clocks have a much more constant rate than the earth but its star clock is still used to determine mean solar time since sometime in the late 20th century earth s rotation has been defined relative to an ensemble of extra-galactic radio sources and then converted to mean solar time by an adopted ratio the difference between this calculated mean solar time and coordinated universal time utc determines whether a leap second is needed the utc time scale now runs on si seconds and the si second when adopted was already a little shorter than the current value of the second of mean solar time 15 see also local mean time meridian

in astronomical journal vol.136 2008 pages 1906-1908 it is stated page 1908 that the si second is equivalent to an older measure of the second of ut1 which was too small to start with and further as the duration of the ut1 second increases the discrepancy widens 2 in the late 1950s the cesium standard was used to measure both the current mean length of the second of mean solar time ut2 result
