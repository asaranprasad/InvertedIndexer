reefs ocean banks continental shelf neritic zone straits pelagic zone oceanic zone seamounts hydrothermal vents cold seeps demersal zone benthic zone v t coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals coral reefs are built by colonies of tiny animals found in marine water that contain few nutrients most coral reefs are built from stony corals which in turn consist of polyps that cluster in groups the polyps belong to a group of animals known as cnidaria which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish unlike sea anemones corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons which support and protect the coral polyps most reefs grow best in warm shallow clear sunny and agitated water often called rainforests of the sea shallow coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on earth they occupy less than 0.1 of the world s ocean surface about half the area of france yet they provide a home for at least 25 of all marine species 1 2 3 4 including fish mollusks worms crustaceans echinoderms sponges tunicates and other cnidarians 5 paradoxically coral reefs flourish even though they are surrounded by ocean waters that provide few nutrients they are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters but deep water and cold water corals also exist on smaller scales in other areas coral reefs deliver ecosystem services to tourism fisheries and shoreline protection the annual global economic value of coral reefs is estimated between us 30 375 billion 6 7 however coral reefs are fragile ecosystems partly

formation edit most of the coral reefs we can see today were formed after the last glacial period when melting ice caused the sea level to rise and flood the continental shelves this means that most modern coral reefs are less than 10,000 years old as communities established themselves on the shelves the reefs grew upwards pacing rising sea levels reefs that rose too slowly could become drowned reefs they are covered by so much water that there was insufficient light 12 coral reefs are found in the deep sea away from continental shelves around oceanic islands and as atolls the vast majority of these islands are volcanic in origin the few exceptions have tectonic origins where plate movements have lifted the deep ocean floor on the surface in 1842 in his first monograph the structure and distribution of coral reefs 13 charles darwin set out his theory of the formation of atoll reefs an idea he conceived during the voyage of the beagle he theorized uplift and subsidence of the earth s crust under the oceans formed the atolls 14 darwin s theory sets out a sequence of three stages in atoll formation it starts with a fringing reef forming around an extinct volcanic island as the island and ocean floor subsides as the subsidence continues the fringing reef becomes a barrier reef and ultimately an atoll reef darwin s theory starts with a volcanic island which becomes extinct as the island and ocean floor subside coral growth builds a fringing reef often including a shallow lagoon between the land and the main reef as the subsidence continues the fringing reef becomes a larger barrier reef further from the shore with a bigger and deeper lagoon inside ultimately the island sinks below the sea and the barrier reef becomes an atoll enclosing an open lagoon darwin predicted that underneath each lagoon would be a bed rock base the remains of the original volcano subsequent drilling proved this correct darwin s theory followed from his understanding that coral polyps thrive in the clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated but can only live within a limited depth range starting just below low tide where the level of the underlying earth allows the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef a fringing reef can take ten thousand years to form and an atoll can take up to 30 million years 15 where the bottom is rising fringing reefs can grow around the coast but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone if the land subsides slowly the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of older dead coral forming a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land a barrier reef can encircle an island and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues to keep up with the sea level forming a central lagoon barrier reefs and atolls do not usually form complete circles but are broken in places by storms like sea level rise a rapidly subsiding bottom can overwhelm coral growth killing the coral polyps and the reef due to what is called coral drowning 16 corals that rely on zooxanthellae can drown when the water becomes too deep for their symbionts to adequately photosynthesize due to decreased light exposure 17 the two main variables determining the geomorphology or shape of coral reefs are the nature of the underlying substrate on which they rest and the history of the change in sea level relative to that substrate the approximately 20,000-year-old great barrier reef offers an example of how coral reefs formed on continental shelves sea level was then 120 m 390 ft lower than in the 21st century 18 19 as sea level rose the water and the corals encroached on what had been hills of the australian coastal plain by 13,000 years ago sea level had risen to 60 m 200 ft lower than at present and many hills of the coastal plains had become continental islands as the sea level rise continued water topped most of the continental islands the corals could then overgrow the hills forming the present cays and reefs sea level on the great barrier reef has not changed significantly in the last 6,000 years 19 and the age of the modern living reef structure is estimated to be between 6,000 and 8,000 years 20 although the great barrier reef formed along a continental shelf and not around a volcanic island darwin s principles apply development stopped at the barrier reef stage since australia is not about to submerge it formed the world s largest barrier reef 300 1,000 m 980 3,280 ft from shore stretching for 2,000 km 1,200 mi 21 healthy tropical coral reefs grow horizontally from 1 to 3 cm 0.39 to 1.18 in per year and grow vertically anywhere from 1 to 25 cm 0.39 to 9.84 in per year however they grow only at depths shallower than 150 m 490 ft because of their need for sunlight and cannot grow above sea level 22 materials edit as the name implies the bulk of coral reefs is made up of coral skeletons from mostly intact coral colonies as other chemical elements present in corals become incorporated into the calcium carbonate deposits aragonite is formed however shell fragments and the remains of calcareous algae such as the green-segmented genus halimeda can add to the reef s ability to withstand damage from storms and other threats such mixtures are visible in structures such as eniwetok atoll 23 types edit since darwin s identification of the three classical reef formations the fringing reef around a volcanic island becoming a barrier reef and then an atoll 24 scientists have identified further reef types while some sources still maintain that there are only three 25 26 thomas and goudie list four principal large-scale coral reef types the fringing reef barrier reef atoll and table reef 27 while spalding et al list five main types the fringing reef barrier reef atoll bank or platform reef and patch reef 28 fringing reef edit fringing reef fringing reef at eilat at the southern tip of israel a fringing reef also called a shore reef 29 is directly attached to a shore 30 or borders it with an intervening narrow shallow channel or lagoon 31 it is the most common reef type 31 fringing reefs follow coastlines and can be many kilometres long 32 they are usually less than 100 metres wide but some are up to several hundred metres wide 33 fringing reefs are initially formed immediately on the shore at the low water level and expand increasingly seawards as they grow in size the final width depends on where the sea bed begins to drop steeply the surface of the fringe reef always remains at the same height just below the waterline in older fringed reefs whose outer regions have pushed themselves far out into the sea the inner part is deepened by erosion and will eventually form a lagoon 34 fringing reef lagoons can become over 100 metres wide and several metres deep like the fringing reef itself they run parallel to the coast the fringing reefs of the red sea are some of the best developed in the world and occur along all its shores except off sandy bays 35 barrier reef edit barrier reef barrier reefs are separated from a mainland or island shore by a deep channel or lagoon 31 they resemble the later stages of a fringing reef with its lagoon but differ from the latter mainly in size and origin their lagoons can be several kilometres wide and 30 to 70 metres deep above all the offshore outer reef edge is not a reef that used to be by the shore and as it grew expanded further and further into the open sea but is a reef that has been there from the very beginning like an atoll it is thought that these reefs are formed either by the lowering of the seabed or by an increase in sea level since a geological process is thus needed for their formation and the formation itself takes considerably longer than that of fringing reef barrier reefs are much rarer the best-known and largest example of a barrier reef is the australian great barrier reef 31 36 other major examples are the belize barrier reef and the new caledonian barrier reef 36 barrier reefs are also found on the coasts of providencia 36 mayotte the gambier islands on the southeast coast coast of kalimantan on parts of the coast of sulawesi southeastern new guinea and the south coast of the louisiade archipelago platform reef edit platform reef while the aforementioned reef types always originate along the coasts of islands or continents platform reefs variously called bank or table reefs can form on the continental shelf as well as in the open ocean in fact anywhere where the seabed rises close enough to the surface of the ocean to enable the growth of zooxanthemic reef-forming corals 37 there are several platform reefs in the southern great barrier reef the swain 38 and capricorn group 39 on the continental shelf about 100 to 200 km from the coast some platform reefs of the northern mascarenes are even several thousand kilometres from the mainland unlike fringing and barrier reefs which only extend seawards platform reefs grown in all directions 37 they are very variable in size ranging from a few hundred metres to many kilometres across their usual shape is oval to strongly elongated parts of these reefs can reach the surface and form sandbanks and small islands around which may form their own fringing reefs in the middle of a platform reef there may be a lagoon platform reefs can also be found within atolls here they are called patch reefs which are only a few dozen metres in diameter where platform reefs form on an elongated structure e g an old eroded barrier reef they can form a linear arrangement this is the case for example on the east coast of the red sea near jedda in very old platform reefs the inner part can be so heavily eroded that they form a pseudo-atoll 37 these can only be distinguished from real atolls by detailed investigation and possibly drilling holes some platform reefs of the laccadives are u-shaped due to wind and water flow atoll edit formation of an atoll according to charles darwin atolls or atoll reefs are more or less circular or continuous barrier reef extends all the way around a lagoon without a central island 40 they are usually formed from fringing reefs around volcanic islands 31 over the course of time the island is eroded away and sinks below the level of the sea 31 atolls may also be formed by the sinking of the seabed or rising of the sea level a ring of reefs results which enclose a lagoon atolls are numerous in the south pacific where they usually occur in mid-ocean for example in the caroline islands the cook islands french polynesia the marshall islands and micronesia 36 many atolls are also found in the indian ocean for example in the maldives the chagos islands the seychelles and around cocos island 36 the maldives consist of 26 atolls 41 other reef types or variants edit a small atoll in the maldives inhabited cay in the maldives apron reef short reef resembling a fringing reef but more sloped extending out and downward from a point or peninsular shore the initial stage of a fringing reef 29 bank reef - isolated flat-topped reef larger than a patch reef and usually on mid-shelf regions and linear or semi-circular in shape a type of platform reef 36 patch reef common isolated comparatively small reef outcrop usually within a lagoon or embayment often circular and surrounded by sand or seagrass type of platform reef 36 ribbon reef long narrow possibly winding reef usually associated with an atoll lagoon also called a shelf-edge reef or sill reef 29 habili reef specific to the red sea does not reach the surface near enough to cause visible surf may be a hazard to ships from the arabic for unborn microatoll community of species of corals vertical growth limited by average tidal height growth morphologies offer a low-resolution record of patterns of sea level change fossilized remains can be dated using radioactive carbon dating and have been used to reconstruct holocene sea levels 42 cays small low-elevation sandy islands formed on the surface of coral reefs from eroded material that piles up forming an area above sea level can be stabilized by plants to become habitable occur in tropical environments throughout the pacific atlantic and indian oceans including the caribbean and on the great barrier reef and belize barrier reef where they provide habitable and agricultural land seamount or guyot formed when a coral reef on a volcanic island subsides tops of seamounts are rounded and guyots are flat flat tops of guyots or tablemounts are due to erosion by waves winds and atmospheric processes zones edit the three major zones of a coral reef the fore reef reef crest and the back reef coral reef ecosystems contain distinct zones that represent different kinds of habitats usually three major zones are recognized the fore reef reef crest and the back reef frequently referred to as the reef lagoon all three zones are physically and ecologically interconnected reef life and oceanic processes create opportunities for exchange of seawater sediments nutrients and marine life among one another thus they are integrated components of the coral reef ecosystem each playing a role in the support of the reefs abundant and diverse fish assemblages most coral reefs exist in shallow waters less than 50 m deep some inhabit tropical continental shelves where cool nutrient rich upwelling does not occur such as great barrier reef others are found in the deep ocean surrounding islands or as atolls such as in the maldives the reefs surrounding islands form when islands subside into the ocean and atolls form when an island subsides below the surface of the sea alternatively moyle and cech distinguish six zones though most reefs possess only some of the zones 43 water in the reef surface zone is often agitated this diagram represents a reef on a continental shelf the water waves at the left travel over the off-reef floor until they encounter the reef slope or fore reef then the waves pass over the shallow reef crest when a wave enters shallow water it shoals that is it slows down and the wave height increases the reef surface is the shallowest part of the reef it is subject to the surge and the rise and fall of tides when waves pass over shallow areas they shoal as shown in the diagram at the right this means the water is often agitated these are the precise condition under which corals flourish shallowness means there is plenty of light for photosynthesis by the symbiotic zooxanthellae and agitated water promotes the ability of coral to feed on plankton however other organisms must be able to withstand the robust conditions to flourish in this zone the off-reef floor is the shallow sea floor surrounding a reef this zone occurs by reefs on continental shelves reefs around tropical islands and atolls drop abruptly to great depths and do not have a floor usually sandy the floor often supports seagrass meadows which are important foraging areas for reef fish the reef drop-off is for its first 50 m habitat for many reef fish who find shelter on the cliff face and plankton in the water nearby the drop-off zone applies mainly to the reefs surrounding oceanic islands and atolls the reef face is the zone above the reef floor or the reef drop-off this zone is often the most diverse area of the reef coral and calcareous algae growths provide complex habitats and areas which offer protection such as cracks and crevices invertebrates and epiphytic algae provide much of the food for other organisms 43 a common feature on this forereef zone is spur and groove formations which serve to transport sediment downslope the reef flat is the sandy-bottomed flat which can be behind the main reef containing chunks of coral this zone may border a lagoon and serve as a protective area or it may lie between the reef and the shore and in this case is a flat rocky area fishes tend to prefer living in that flat rocky area compared to any other zone when it is present 43 the reef lagoon is an entirely enclosed region which creates an area less affected by wave action that often contains small reef patches 43 however the topography of coral reefs is constantly changing each reef is made up of irregular patches of algae sessile invertebrates and bare rock and sand the size shape and relative abundance of these patches changes from year to year in response to the various factors that favor one type of patch over another growing coral for example produces constant change in the fine structure of reefs on a larger scale tropical storms may knock out large sections of reef and cause boulders on sandy areas to move 44 locations edit locations of coral reefs boundary for 20 c isotherms most corals live within this boundary note the cooler waters caused by upwelling on the southwest coast of africa and off the coast of peru this map shows areas of upwelling in red coral reefs are not found in coastal areas where colder and nutrient-rich upwellings occur coral reefs are estimated to cover 284,300 km2 109,800 sq mi 45 just under 0.1 of the oceans surface area the indo-pacific region including the red sea indian ocean southeast asia and the pacific account for 91.9 of this total southeast asia accounts for 32.3 of that figure while the pacific including australia accounts for 40.8 atlantic and caribbean coral reefs account for 7.6 2 although corals exist both in temperate and tropical waters shallow-water reefs form only in a zone extending from approximately 30 n to 30 s of the equator tropical corals do not grow at depths of over 50 meters 160 ft the optimum temperature for most coral reefs is 26 27 c 79 81 f and few reefs exist in waters below 18 c 64 f 46 however reefs in the persian gulf have adapted to temperatures of 13 c 55 f in winter and 38 c 100 f in summer 47 there are 37 species of scleractinian corals identified in such harsh environment around larak island 48 deep-water coral can exist at greater depths and colder temperatures at much higher latitudes as far north as norway 49 although deep water corals can form reefs very little is known about them coral reefs are rare along the west coasts of the americas and africa due primarily to upwelling and strong cold coastal currents that reduce water temperatures in these areas respectively the peru benguela and canary streams 50 corals are seldom found along the coastline of south asia from the eastern tip of india chennai to the bangladesh and myanmar borders 2 as well as along the coasts of northeastern south america and bangladesh due to the freshwater release from the amazon and ganges rivers respectively the great barrier reef largest comprising over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,600 kilometers 1,600 mi off

identified 915 reef fish species and more than 400 scleractinian coral species 12 of which are endemic the raja ampat islands in indonesia s west papua province offer the highest known marine diversity 52 bermuda is known for its northernmost coral reef system located at 32.4 n and 64.8 w the presence of coral reefs at this high latitude is due to the proximity of the gulf stream bermuda has a fairly consistent diversity of coral species representing a subset of those found in the greater caribbean 53 the world s northernmost individual coral reef so far discovered is located within a bay of japan s tsushima island in the korea strait 54 the world s southernmost coral reef is at lord howe island in the pacific ocean off the east coast of australia biology edit anatomy of a coral polyp alive corals are colonies of small animals embedded in calcium carbonate shells it is a mistake to think of coral as plants or rocks coral heads consist of accumulations of individual animals called polyps arranged in diverse shapes 55 polyps are usually tiny but they can range in size from a pinhead to 12 inches 30 cm across reef-building or hermatypic corals live only in the photic zone above 50 m the depth to which sufficient sunlight penetrates the water allowing photosynthesis to occur coral polyps do not photosynthesize but have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae of the genus symbiodinium commonly referred to as zooxanthellae these organisms live within the tissues of polyps and provide organic nutrients that nourish the polyp because of this relationship coral reefs grow much faster in clear water which admits more sunlight without their symbionts coral growth would be too slow to form significant reef structures corals get up to 90 of their nutrients from their symbionts 56 reefs grow as polyps and other organisms deposit calcium carbonate 57 58 the basis of coral as a skeletal structure beneath and around themselves pushing the coral head s top upwards and outwards 59 waves grazing fish such as parrotfish sea urchins sponges and other forces and organisms act as bioeroders breaking down coral skeletons into fragments that settle into spaces in the reef structure or form sandy bottoms in associated reef lagoons many other organisms living in the reef community contribute skeletal calcium carbonate in the same manner 60 coralline algae are important contributors to reef structure in those parts of the reef subjected to the greatest forces by waves such as the reef front facing the open ocean these algae strengthen the reef structure by depositing limestone in sheets over the reef surface typical shapes for coral species are wrinkled brains cabbages table tops antlers wire strands and pillars these shapes can depend on the life history of the coral like light exposure and wave action 61 and events such as breakages 62 table coral close up of polyps are arrayed on a coral waving their tentacles there can be thousands of polyps on a single coral branch corals reproduce both sexually and asexually an individual polyp uses both reproductive modes within its lifetime corals reproduce sexually by either internal or external fertilization the reproductive cells are found on the mesenteries membranes that radiate inward from the layer of tissue that lines the stomach cavity some mature adult corals are hermaphroditic others are exclusively male or female a few species change sex as they grow internally fertilized eggs develop in the polyp for a period ranging from days to weeks subsequent development produces a tiny larva known as a planula externally fertilized eggs develop during synchronized spawning polyps release eggs and sperm into the water en masse simultaneously eggs disperse over a large area the timing of spawning depends on time of year water temperature and tidal and lunar cycles spawning is most successful when there is little variation between high and low tide the less water movement the better the chance for fertilization ideal timing occurs in the spring release of eggs or planula usually occurs at night and is sometimes in phase with the lunar cycle three to six days after a full moon the period from release to settlement lasts only a few days but some planulae can survive afloat for several weeks they are vulnerable to predation and environmental conditions the lucky few planulae which successfully attach to substrate next confront competition for food and space citation needed there are eight clades of symbiodinium phylotypes most research has been completed on the symbiodinium clades a d each one of the eight contributes their own benefits as well as less compatible attributes to the survival of their coral hosts each photosynthetic organism has a specific level of sensitivity to photodamage of compounds needed for survival such as proteins rates of regeneration and replication determine the organism s ability to survive phylotype a is found more in the shallow regions of marine waters it is able to produce mycosporine-like amino acids that are uv resistant using a derivative of glycerin to absorb the uv radiation and allowing them to become more receptive to warmer water temperatures in the event of uv or thermal damage if and when repair occurs it will increase the likelihood of survival of the host and symbiont this leads to the idea that evolutionarily clade a is more uv resistant and thermally resistant than the other clades 63 clades b and c are found more frequently in the deeper water regions which may explain the higher susceptibility to increased temperatures terrestrial plants that receive less sunlight because they are found in the undergrowth can be analogized to clades b c and d since clades b through d are found at deeper depths they require an elevated light absorption rate to be able to synthesize as much energy with elevated absorption rates at uv wavelengths the deeper occurring phylotypes are more prone to coral bleaching versus the more shallow clades clade d has been observed to be high temperature-tolerant and as a result it has a higher rate of survival than clades b and c 63 brain coral staghorn coral spiral wire coral pillar coral mushroom coral maze coral black coral fluorescent coral 64 darwin s paradox edit darwin s paradox coral seems to proliferate when ocean waters are warm poor clear and agitated a fact which darwin had already noted when he passed through tahiti in 1842 this constitutes a fundamental paradox shown quantitatively by the apparent impossibility of balancing input and output of the nutritive elements which control the coral polyp metabolism recent oceanographic research has brought to light the reality of this paradox by confirming that the oligotrophy of the ocean euphotic zone persists right up to the swell-battered reef crest when you approach the reef edges and atolls from the quasidesert of the open sea the near absence of living matter suddenly becomes a plethora of life without transition so why is there something rather than nothing and more precisely where do the necessary nutrients for the functioning of this extraordinary coral reef machine come from francis rougerie 65 in the structure and distribution of coral reefs published in 1842 darwin described how coral reefs were found in some areas of the tropical seas but not others with no obvious cause the largest and strongest corals grew in parts of the reef exposed to the most violent surf and corals were weakened or absent where loose sediment accumulated 66 tropical waters contain few nutrients 67 yet a coral reef can flourish like an oasis in the desert 68 this has given rise to the ecosystem conundrum sometimes called darwin s paradox how can such high production flourish in such nutrient poor conditions 69 70 71 coral reefs cover less than 0.1 of the surface of the world s ocean about half the land area of france yet they support over one-quarter of all marine species this diversity results in complex food webs with large predator fish eating smaller forage fish that eat yet smaller zooplankton and so on however all food webs eventually depend on plants which are the primary producers coral reefs primary productivity is very high typically producing 5 10 grams of carbon per square meter per day gc m 2 day 1 biomass 72 73 one reason for the unusual clarity of tropical waters is they are deficient in nutrients and drifting plankton further the sun shines year-round in the tropics warming the surface layer making it less dense than subsurface layers the warmer water is separated from deeper cooler water by a stable thermocline where the temperature makes a rapid change this keeps the warm surface waters floating above the cooler deeper waters in most parts of the ocean there is little exchange between these layers organisms that die in aquatic environments generally sink to the bottom where they decompose which releases nutrients in the form of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k these nutrients are necessary for plant growth but in the tropics they do not directly return to the surface citation needed plants form the base of the food chain and need sunlight and nutrients to grow in the ocean these plants are mainly microscopic phytoplankton which drift in the water column they need sunlight for photosynthesis which powers carbon fixation so they are found only relatively near the surface but they also need nutrients phytoplankton rapidly use nutrients in the surface waters and in the tropics these nutrients are not usually replaced because of the thermocline citation needed coral polyps explanations edit around coral reefs lagoons fill in with material eroded from the reef and the island they become havens for marine life providing protection from waves and storms most importantly reefs recycle nutrients which happens much less in the open ocean in coral reefs and lagoons producers include phytoplankton as well as seaweed and coralline algae especially small types called turf algae which pass nutrients to corals 74 the phytoplankton are eaten by fish and crustaceans who also pass nutrients along the food web recycling ensures fewer nutrients are needed overall to support the community coral reefs support many symbiotic relationships in particular zooxanthellae provide energy to coral in the form of glucose glycerol and amino acids 75 zooxanthellae can provide up to 90 of a coral s energy requirements 56 in return as an example of mutualism the corals shelter the zooxanthellae averaging one million for every cubic centimeter of coral and provide a constant supply of the carbon dioxide they need for photosynthesis the color of corals depends on the combination of brown shades provided by their zooxanthellae and pigmented proteins reds blues greens etc produced by the corals themselves corals also absorb nutrients including inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus directly from water many corals extend their tentacles at night to catch zooplankton that brush them when the water is agitated zooplankton provide the polyp with nitrogen and the polyp shares some of the nitrogen with the zooxanthellae which also require this element 74 the varying pigments in different species of zooxanthellae give them an overall brown or golden-brown appearance and give brown corals their colors other pigments such as reds blues greens etc come from colored proteins made by the coral animals coral which loses a large fraction of its zooxanthellae becomes white or sometimes pastel shades in corals that are richly pigmented with their own colorful proteins and is said to be bleached a condition which unless corrected can kill the coral sponges are another key they live in crevices in the coral reefs they are efficient filter feeders and in the red sea they consume about 60 of the phytoplankton that drifts by the sponges eventually excrete nutrients in a form the corals can use 76 most coral polyps are nocturnal feeders here in the dark polyps have extended their tentacles to feed on zooplankton the roughness of coral surfaces is the key to coral survival in agitated waters normally a boundary layer of still water surrounds a submerged object which acts as a barrier waves breaking on the extremely rough edges of corals disrupt the boundary layer allowing the corals access to passing nutrients turbulent water thereby promotes reef growth and branching without the nutritional gains brought by rough coral surfaces even the most effective recycling would leave corals wanting in nutrients 77 studies have shown that deep nutrient-rich water entering coral reefs through isolated events may have significant effects on temperature and nutrient systems 78 79 this water movement disrupts the relatively stable thermocline that usually exists between warm shallow water to deeper colder water leichter et al 2006 80 found that temperature regimes on coral reefs in the bahamas and florida were highly variable with temporal scales of minutes to seasons and spatial scales across depths water can be moved through coral reefs in various ways including current rings surface waves internal waves and tidal changes 78 81 82 83 movement is generally created by tides and wind as tides interact with varying bathymetry and wind mixes with surface water internal waves are created an internal wave is a gravity wave that moves along density stratification within the ocean when a water parcel encounters a different density it will oscillate and create internal waves 84 while internal waves generally have a lower frequency than surface waves they often form as a single wave that breaks into multiple waves as it hits a slope and moves upward 85 this vertical break up of internal waves causes significant diapycnal mixing and turbulence 86 87 internal waves can act as nutrient pumps bringing plankton and cool nutrient-rich water up to the surface 78 83 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 the irregular structure characteristic of coral reef bathymetry may enhance mixing and produce pockets of cooler water and variable nutrient content 97 arrival of cool nutrient-rich water from depths due to internal waves and tidal bores has been linked to growth rates of suspension feeders and benthic algae 83 96 98 as well as plankton and larval organisms 83 99 leichter et al 96 proposed that the seaweed codium isthmocladum reacts to deep water nutrient sources due to their tissues having different concentrations of nutrients dependent upon depth wolanski and hamner 90 noted aggregations of eggs larval organisms and plankton on reefs in response to deep water intrusions similarly as internal waves and bores move vertically surface-dwelling larval organisms are carried toward the shore 99 this has significant biological importance to cascading effects of food chains in coral reef ecosystems and may provide yet another key to unlocking darwin s paradox cyanobacteria provide soluble nitrates for the reef via nitrogen fixation 100 coral reefs also often depend on surrounding habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangrove forests for nutrients seagrass and mangroves supply dead plants and animals which are rich in nitrogen and also serve to feed fish and animals from the reef by supplying wood and vegetation reefs in turn protect mangroves and seagrass from waves and produce sediment in which the mangroves and seagrass can root 47 biodiversity edit tube sponges attracting cardinal fishes glassfishes and wrasses over 4,000 species of fish inhabit coral reefs organisms can cover every square inch of a coral reef coral reefs form some of the world s most productive ecosystems providing complex and varied marine habitats that support a wide range of other organisms 101 102 fringing reefs just below low tide level have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high tide level and sea grass meadows in between the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted while the mangroves and sea grass protect the coral from large influxes of silt fresh water and pollutants this level of variety in the environment benefits many coral reef animals which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding 103 reefs are home to a large variety of animals including fish seabirds sponges cnidarians which includes some types of corals and jellyfish worms crustaceans including shrimp cleaner shrimp spiny lobsters and crabs mollusks including cephalopods echinoderms including starfish sea urchins and sea cucumbers sea squirts sea turtles and sea snakes aside from humans mammals are rare on coral reefs with visiting cetaceans such as dolphins being the main exception a few of these varied species feed directly on corals while others graze on algae on the reef 2 74 reef biomass is positively related to species diversity 104 the same hideouts in a reef may be regularly inhabited by different species at different times of day nighttime predators such as cardinalfish and squirrelfish hide during the day while damselfish surgeonfish triggerfish wrasses and parrotfish hide from eels and sharks 23 49 algae edit reefs are chronically at risk of algal encroachment overfishing and excess nutrient supply from onshore can enable algae to outcompete and kill the coral 105 106 increased nutrient levels can be a result of sewage or chemical fertilizer runoff from nearby coastal developments runoff can carry nitrogen and phosphorus which promote excess algae growth algae can sometimes out-compete the coral for space the algae can then smother the coral by decreasing the oxygen supply available to the reef decreased oxygen levels can slow down coral s calcification rates weakening the coral and leaving it more susceptible to disease and degradation 107 in surveys done around largely uninhabited us pacific islands algae inhabit a large percentage of surveyed coral locations 108 the algal population consists of turf algae coralline algae and macro algae sponges edit sponges are essential for the functioning of the coral reef s ecosystem algae and corals in coral reefs produce organic material this is filtered through sponges which convert this organic material into small particles which in turn are absorbed by algae and corals 109 fish edit over 4,000 species of fish inhabit coral reefs 2 the reasons for this diversity remain unclear hypotheses include the lottery in which the first lucky winner recruit to a territory is typically able to defend it against latecomers competition in which adults compete for territory and less-competitive species must be able to survive in poorer habitat and predation in which population size is a function of postsettlement piscivore mortality 110 healthy reefs can produce up to 35 tons of fish per square kilometer each year but damaged reefs produce much less 111 invertebrates edit sea urchins dotidae and sea slugs eat seaweed some species of sea urchins such as diadema antillarum can play a pivotal part in preventing algae from overrunning reefs 112 nudibranchia and sea anemones eat sponges a number of invertebrates collectively called cryptofauna inhabit the coral skeletal substrate itself either boring into the skeletons through the process of bioerosion or living in pre-existing voids and crevices those animals boring into the rock include sponges bivalve mollusks and sipunculans those settling on the reef include many other species particularly crustaceans and polychaete worms 50 seabirds edit coral reef systems provide important habitats for seabird species some endangered for example midway atoll in hawaii supports nearly three million seabirds including two-thirds 1.5 million of the global population of laysan albatross and one-third of the global population of black-footed albatross 113 each seabird species has specific sites on the atoll where they nest altogether 17 species of seabirds live on midway the short-tailed albatross is the rarest with fewer than 2,200 surviving after excessive feather hunting in the late 19th century 114 other edit sea snakes feed exclusively on fish and their eggs 115 116 117 marine birds such as herons gannets pelicans and boobies feed on reef fish some land-based reptiles intermittently associate with reefs such as monitor lizards the marine crocodile and semiaquatic snakes such as laticauda colubrina sea turtles particularly hawksbill sea turtles feed on sponges 118 119 120 schooling reef fish caribbean reef squid banded coral shrimp whitetip reef shark green turtle giant clam soft coral cup coral sponges and ascidians banded sea krait the shell of latiaxis wormaldi a coral snail importance edit coral reefs deliver ecosystem services to tourism fisheries and coastline protection the global economic value of coral reefs has been estimated to be between us 29.8 billion 6 and 375 billion per year 7 coral reefs protect shorelines by absorbing wave energy and many small islands would not exist without their reefs to protect them according to the environmental group world wide fund for nature the economic cost over a 25-year period of destroying one kilometer of coral reef is somewhere between 137,000 and 1,200,000 121 about six million tons of fish are taken each year from coral reefs well-managed coral reefs have an annual yield of 15 tons of seafood on average per square kilometer southeast asia s coral reef fisheries alone yield about 2.4 billion annually from seafood 121 to improve the management of coastal coral reefs another environmental group the world resources institute wri developed and published tools for calculating the value of coral reef-related tourism shoreline protection and fisheries partnering with five caribbean countries as of april 2011 published working papers covered st lucia tobago belize and the dominican republic with a paper for jamaica in preparation the wri was also making sure that the study results support improved coastal policies and management planning 122 the belize study estimated the value of reef and mangrove services at 395 559 million annually 123 bermuda s coral reefs provide economic benefits to the island worth on average 722 million per year based on six key ecosystem services according to sarkis et al 2010 124 threats edit island with fringing reef off yap micronesia 125 coral reefs are dying around the world 125 in particular coral mining agricultural and urban runoff pollution organic and inorganic overfishing blast fishing disease and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems broader threats are sea temperature rise sea level rise and ph changes from ocean acidification all associated with greenhouse gas emissions a 2014 study lists factors such as population explosion along the coast lines overfishing the pollution of coastal areas global warming and invasive species among the main reasons that have put reefs in danger of extinction 126 a study released in april 2013 has shown that air pollution can also stunt the growth of coral reefs researchers from australia panama and the uk used coral records between 1880 and 2000 from the western caribbean to show the threat of factors such as coal-burning and volcanic eruptions 127 pollutants such as tributyltin a biocide released into water from in anti-fouling paint can be toxic to corals in 2011 researchers suggested that extant marine invertebrates face the same synergistic effects of multiple stressors that occurred during the end-permian extinction and that genera with poorly buffered respiratory physiology and calcareous shells such as corals were particularly vulnerable 128 129 130 rock coral on seamounts across the ocean are under fire from bottom trawling reportedly up to 50 of the catch is rock coral and the practice transforms coral structures to rubble with it taking years to regrow these coral communities are disappearing faster than they can sustain themselves 131 another cause for the death of coral reefs is bioerosion various fishes graze corals dead or alive and change the morphology of coral reefs making them more susceptible to other physical and chemical threats it has been generally observed that only the algae growing on dead corals is eaten and the live ones are not however this act still destroys the top layer of coral substrate and makes it harder for the reefs to sustain 132 in el ni o-year 2010 preliminary reports show global coral bleaching reached its worst level since another el ni o year 1998 when 16 of the world s reefs died as a result of increased water temperature in indonesia s aceh province surveys showed some 80 of bleached corals died scientists do not yet understand the long-term impacts of coral bleaching but they do know that bleaching leaves corals vulnerable to disease stunts their growth and affects their reproduction while severe bleaching kills them 133 in july malaysia closed several dive sites where virtually all the corals were damaged by bleaching 134 135 to find answers for these problems researchers study the various factors that impact reefs the list includes the ocean s role as a carbon dioxide sink atmospheric changes ultraviolet light ocean acidification viruses impacts of dust storms carrying agents to far-flung reefs pollutants algal blooms and others reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas citation needed coral reefs with one type of zooxanthellae are more prone to bleaching than are reefs with another more hardy species 136 general estimates show approximately 10 of the world s coral reefs are dead 137 138 about 60 of the world s reefs are at risk due to destructive human-related activities the threat to the health of reefs is particularly high in southeast asia where 95 of reefs are at risk from local threats 139 by the 2030s 90 of reefs are expected to be at risk from both human activities and climate change by 2050 all coral reefs will be in danger 140 current research is showing that ecotourism in the great barrier reef is contributing to coral disease 141 and that chemicals in sunscreens may contribute to the impact of viruses on zooxanthellae 8 some scientists including those associated with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration posit that us coral reefs are likely to disappear within a few decades as a result of global warming 142 protection edit a diversity of corals marine protected areas mpas have become increasingly prominent for reef management mpas promote responsible fishery management and habitat protection much like national parks and wildlife refuges and to varying degrees mpas restrict potentially damaging activities mpas encompass both social and biological objectives including reef restoration aesthetics biodiversity and economic benefits however there are very few mpas that have actually made a substantial difference research in indonesia philippines and papua new guinea shows that there is no significant difference between an mpa site and an unprotected site 143 144 conflicts surrounding mpas involve lack of participation clashing views of the government and fisheries effectiveness of the area and funding 145 in some situations as in the phoenix islands protected area mpas can also provide revenue potentially equal to the income they would have generated without controls as kiribati did for its phoenix islands 146 according to the made by the iucn states that stopping overfishing especially key fishes to coral reef like parrotfish coastal zone management which reduce human pressure on reef for example restricting the coastal settlement development and tourism in coastal reef and controlling pollution specially sewage wastage may not only reduce coral declining but also reverse it and may let to coral reef more adaptable to changes relates to climate and acidification the report shows that healthier reef in the caribbean are those with large population of parrotfish in countries which protect these key fishes and sea urchins banning fish trap and spearfishing creating resilient reefs 147 to help combat ocean acidification some laws are in place to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide the clean water act puts pressure on state government agencies to monitor and limit runoff of pollutants that can cause ocean acidification stormwater surge preventions are also in place as well as coastal buffers between agricultural land and the coastline this act also ensures that delicate watershed ecosystems are intact such as wetlands the clean water act is funded by the federal government and is monitored by various watershed groups many land use laws aim to reduce co2 emissions by limiting deforestation deforestation causes erosion which releases a large amount of carbon stored in the soil which then flows into the ocean contributing to ocean acidification incentives are used to reduce miles traveled by vehicles which reduces the carbon emissions into the atmosphere thereby reducing the amount of dissolved co2 in the ocean state and federal governments also control coastal erosion which releases stored carbon in the soil into the ocean increasing ocean acidification 148 high-end satellite technology is increasingly being employed to monitor coral reef conditions 149 biosphere reserve marine park national monument and world heritage status can protect reefs for example belize s barrier reef sian ka an the galapagos islands great barrier reef henderson island palau and papah naumoku kea marine national monument are world heritage sites 150 in australia the great barrier reef is protected by the great barrier reef marine park authority and is the subject of much legislation including a biodiversity action plan 151 they have compiled a coral reef resilience action plan this detailed action plan consists of numerous adaptive management strategies including reducing our carbon footprint which would ultimately reduce the amount of ocean acidification in the oceans surrounding the great barrier reef an extensive public awareness plan is also in place to provide education on the rainforests of the sea and how people can reduce carbon emissions thereby reducing ocean acidification 152 inhabitants of ahus island manus province papua new guinea have followed a generations-old practice of restricting fishing in six areas of their reef lagoon their cultural traditions allow line fishing but no net or spear fishing the result is both the biomass and individual fish sizes are significantly larger than in places where fishing is unrestricted 153 154 restoration edit coral fragments growing on nontoxic concrete coral aquaculture also known as coral farming or coral gardening is showing promise as a potentially effective tool for restoring coral reefs which have been declining around the world 155 156 157 the process bypasses the early growth stages of corals when they are most at risk of dying coral seeds are grown in nurseries then replanted on the reef 158 coral is farmed by coral farmers who live locally to the reefs and farm for reef conservation or for income efforts to expand the size and number of coral reefs generally involve supplying substrate to allow more corals to find a home substrate materials include discarded vehicle tires scuttled ships subway cars and formed concrete such as reef balls reefs also grow unaided on marine structures such as oil rigs citation needed in large restoration projects propagated hermatypic coral on substrate can be secured with metal pins superglue or milliput 159 needle and thread can also attach a-hermatype coral to substrate 160 a substrate for growing corals referred to as biorock is produced by running low voltage electrical currents through seawater to crystallize dissolved minerals onto steel structures the resultant white carbonate aragonite is the same mineral that makes up natural coral reefs corals rapidly colonize and grow at accelerated rates on these coated structures the electrical currents also accelerate formation and growth of both chemical limestone rock and the skeletons of corals and other shell-bearing organisms the vicinity of the anode and cathode provides a high-ph environment which inhibits the growth of competitive filamentous and fleshy algae the increased growth rates fully depend on the accretion activity 161 during accretion the settled corals display an increased growth rate size and density but after the process is complete growth rate and density return to levels comparable to natural growth and are about the same size or slightly smaller 161 one case study with coral reef restoration was conducted on the island of oahu in hawaii the university of hawaii has come up with a coral reef assessment and monitoring program to help relocate and restore coral reefs in hawaii a boat channel on the island of oahu to the hawaii institute of marine biology was overcrowded with coral reefs also many areas of coral reef patches in the channel had been damaged from past dredging in the channel dredging covers the existing corals with sand and their larvae cannot build and thrive on sand they can only build on to existing reefs because of this the university of hawaii decided to relocate some of the coral reef to a different transplant site they transplanted them with the help of the united states army divers to a relocation site relatively close to the channel they observed very little if any damage occurred to any of the colonies while they were being transported and no mortality of coral reefs has been observed on the new transplant site but they will be continuing to monitor the new transplant site to see how potential environmental impacts i e ocean acidification will harm the overall reef mortality rate while trying to attach the coral to the new transplant site they found the coral placed on hard rock is growing considerably well and coral was even growing on the wires that attached the transplant corals to the transplant site this gives new hope to future research on coral reef transplant sites as a result of this coral restoration project no environmental effects were seen from the transplantation process no recreational activities were decreased and no scenic areas were affected by the project this is a great example that coral transplantation and restoration can work and thrive under the right conditions which means there may be hope for other damaged coral reefs 162 another possibility for coral restoration is gene therapy through infecting coral with genetically modified bacteria it may be possible to grow corals that are more resistant to climate change and other threats 163 reefs in the past edit ancient coral reefs throughout earth history from a few thousand years after hard skeletons were developed by marine organisms there were almost always reefs the times of maximum development were in the middle cambrian 513 501 ma devonian 416 359 ma and carboniferous 359 299 ma owing to order rugosa extinct corals and late cretaceous 100 66 ma and all neogene 23 ma present owing to order scleractinia corals not all reefs in the past were formed by corals those in the early cambrian 542 513 ma resulted from calcareous algae and archaeocyathids small animals with conical shape probably related to sponges and in the late cretaceous 100 66 ma when there also existed reefs formed by a group of bivalves called rudists one of the valves formed the main conical structure and the other much smaller valve acted as a cap measurements of the oxygen isotopic composition of the aragonitic skeleton of coral reefs such as porites can indicate changes in the sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity conditions of the ocean during the growth of the coral this technique is often used by climate scientists to infer the paleoclimate of a region 164 see
