the highest population growth rates global population increases above 1.8 per year occurred between 1955 and 1975 peaking to 2.06 between 1965 and 1970 2 the growth rate has declined to 1.18 between 2010 and 2015 and is projected to decline to 0.13 by the year 2100 2 total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 139 million 4 and are now expected to remain essentially constant at their 2011 level of 135 million 5 while deaths number 56 million per year and are expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040 6 the median age of the world s population was estimated to be

estimates for the population of the world 23 date to the 17th century william petty in 1682 estimated world population at 320 million modern estimates ranging close to twice this number by the late 18th century estimates ranged close to one billion consistent with modern estimates 24 more refined estimates broken down by continents were published in the first half of the 19th century at 600 to 1000 million in the early 1800s and at 800 to 1000 million in the 1840s 25 antiquity and middle ages edit estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 bc have ranged between 1 million and 15 million 26 27 even earlier genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 bc according to the toba catastrophe theory by contrast it is estimated that around 50 60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western roman empire in the 4th century ad 28 the plague of justinian which first emerged during the reign of the roman emperor justinian caused europe s population to drop by around 50 between the 6th and 8th centuries ad 29 the population of europe was more than 70 million in 1340 30 the black death pandemic of the 14th century may have reduced the world s population from an estimated 450 million in 1340 to between 350 and 375 million in 1400 31 it took 200 years for population figures to recover 32 the population of china decreased from 123 million in 1200 to 65 million in 1393 33 presumably due to a combination of mongol invasions famine and plague 34 starting in ad 2 the han dynasty of ancient china kept consistent family registers in order to properly assess the poll taxes and labor service duties of each household 35 in that year the population of western han was recorded as 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households decreasing to 47,566,772 individuals in 9,348,227 households by ad 146 towards the end of the han dynasty 35 at the founding of the ming dynasty in 1368 china s population was reported to be close to 60 million toward the end of the dynasty in 1644 it may have approached 150 million 36 england s population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650 up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500 37 new crops that were brought to asia and europe from the americas by portuguese and spanish colonists in the 16th century are believed to have contributed to population growth 38 39 40 since their introduction to africa by portuguese traders in the 16th century 41 maize and cassava have similarly replaced traditional african crops as the most important staple food crops grown on the continent 42 the pre-columbian north american population probably numbered somewhere between 2 million and 18 million 43 encounters between european explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence 44 according to the most extreme scholarly claims as many as 90 of the native american population of the new world died due to old world diseases such as smallpox measles and influenza 45 over the centuries the europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases while the indigenous peoples had no such immunity 46 modern era edit map showing urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006 only 3 of the world s population lived in urban areas in 1800 this proportion had risen to 47 by 2000 and reached 50.5 by 2010 47 by 2050 the proportion may reach 70 48 during the european agricultural and industrial revolutions the life expectancy of children increased dramatically 49 the percentage of the children born in london who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5 in 1730 1749 to 31.8 in 1810 1829 50 51 between 1700 and 1900 europe s population increased from about 100 million to over 400 million 52 altogether the areas populated by people of european descent comprised 36 of the world s population in 1900 53 population growth in the west became more rapid after the introduction of vaccination and other improvements in medicine and sanitation 54 improved material conditions led to the population of britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 19th century 55 the population of the united kingdom reached 60 million in 2006 56 the united states saw its population grow from around 5.3 million in 1800 to 106 million in 1920 exceeding 307 million in 2010 57 the first half of the 20th century in imperial russia and the soviet union was marked by a succession of major wars famines and other disasters which caused large-scale population losses approximately 60 million excess deaths 58 59 after the collapse of the soviet union russia s population declined significantly from 150 million in 1991 to 143 million in 2012 60 but by 2013 this decline appeared to have halted 61 many countries in the developing world have experienced extremely rapid population growth since the early 20th century due to economic development and improvements in public health china s population rose from approximately 430 million in 1850 to 580 million in 1953 62 and now stands at over 1.3 billion the population of the indian subcontinent which was about 125 million in 1750 increased to 389 million in 1941 63 today india pakistan and bangladesh are collectively home to about 1.63 billion people 64 java had about 5 million inhabitants in 1815 its present-day successor indonesia now has a population of over 140 million 65 in just one hundred years the population of brazil decoupled x10 from about

first time in 1804 it was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927 but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960 69 thereafter the global population reached four billion in 1974 five billion in 1987 six billion in 1999 and according to the united states census bureau seven billion in march 2012 70 the united nations however estimated that the world population reached seven billion in october 2011 71 72 73 according to current projections the global population will reach eight billion by 2024 and will likely reach around nine billion by 2042 alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion 74 projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations especially the fertility variable long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the low scenario to high scenarios of 24.8 billion 74 one extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150 assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman however by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52 10 75 there is no estimation for the exact day or month the world s population surpassed one or two billion the points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted but the international database of the united states census bureau placed them in july 1959 and april 1974 respectively the united nations did determine and commemorate the day of 5 billion on july 11 1987 and the day of 6 billion on october 12 1999 the population division of the united nations declared the day of 7 billion to be october 31 2011 76 global demographics edit 2012 map showing average life

estimates of population evolution in different continents between 1950 and 2050 according to the united nations the vertical axis is logarithmic and is in millions of people population size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions nonetheless population growth is the long-standing trend on all inhabited continents as well as in most individual states during the 20th century the global population saw its greatest increase in known history rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000 a number of factors contributed to this increase including the lessening of the mortality rate in many countries by improved sanitation and medical advances and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the green revolution 101 102 103 in 2000 the united nations estimated that the world s population was growing at an annual rate of 1.14 equivalent to around 75 million people 104 down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989 by 2000 there were approximately ten times as many people on earth as there had been in 1700 globally the population growth rate has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.19 in 1963 but growth remains high in latin

population over time due to sub-replacement fertility rates 100 in 2006 the united nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition if this trend continues the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050 concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion 106 however this is only one of many estimates published by the un in 2009 un population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion 107 an alternative scenario is given by the statistician jorgen randers who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility randers most likely scenario reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people followed by decline 108 adrian raftery a university of washington professor of statistics and of sociology states that there s a 70 percent probability the world population will not

growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025 124 the hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development this feedback can be described as follows technological advance increase in the carrying capacity of land for people demographic growth more people more potential inventors acceleration of technological advance accelerating growth of the carrying capacity faster population growth accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors faster technological advance hence the faster growth of the earth s carrying capacity for people and so on 125 the transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition according to the russian demographer sergey kapitsa 126 the world population grew between 67,000 bc and 1965 according to the following formula n c arccot t 0 t displaystyle n frac c tau operatorname arccot frac t 0 -t tau where n is current population t is the current year c 1.86 0.01 1011 t0 2007 1 displaystyle tau 42 1 years for world population to double edit according to linear interpolation and extrapolation of undesa population estimates the world population has doubled or will double in the years listed in the tables below with two different starting points during the 2nd millennium each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above however after 2024 it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century 127 historic chart showing the periods of time the world population has taken to double from 1700 to 2000 starting at 500

million people on its own water as of 2015 the area has a population of over 18 million researchers predict that similar cases of resource scarcity will grow more common as the world population increases 128 in his 1798 work an essay on the principle of population the british scholar thomas malthus incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century malthus wrote the essay to refute what he considered the unattainable utopian ideas of william godwin and marquis de condorcet as presented in political justice and the future progress of the human mind in 1968 paul r ehrlich reprised malthus argument in the population bomb predicting that mass global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s 129 the predictions of ehrlich and other neo-malthusians were vigorously challenged by a number of economists notably julian lincoln simon and advances in agriculture collectively known as the green revolution forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century between 1950 and 1984 as the green revolution transformed agriculture around the world grain production increased by over 250 130 the world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the green revolution but food production has so far kept pace with population growth most scholars believe that without the revolution there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the un presently documents 131 however neo-malthusians point out that fossil fuels provided the energy for the green revolution in the form of natural gas-derived fertilizers oil-derived pesticides and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions 132 in 2004 a meta-analysis of 70 quantitative studies estimating a sustainable limit to the world population generated a meta-estimate of 7.7 billion people 133 graph of the global human population from 10,000 bc to ad 2000 from the us census bureau the graph shows the extremely rapid growth in the world population that has taken place since the 18th century the human population has been growing rapidly since the mid-1800s in may 2008 the price of grain was pushed up severely by the increased cultivation of biofuels the increase of world oil prices to over 140 per barrel 880 m3 134 global population growth 135 the effects of climate change 136 the loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development 137 138 and growing consumer demand in the population centres of china and india 139 140 food riots subsequently occurred in some countries 141 142 however oil prices then fell sharply resource demands are expected to ease as population growth declines but it is unclear whether mass food wastage and rising living standards in developing countries will once again create resource shortages 143 144 david pimentel professor of ecology and agriculture at cornell university estimates that the sustainable agricultural carrying capacity for the united states is about 200 million people its population as of 2015 is over 300 million 145 in 2009 the uk government s chief scientific advisor professor john beddington warned that growing populations falling energy reserves and food shortages would create a perfect storm of shortages of food water and energy by 2030 128 146 according to a 2009 report by the united nations food and agriculture organisation fao the world will have to produce 70 more food by 2050 to feed a projected extra 2.3 billion people 147 the observed figures for 2007 showed an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world with 923 million undernourished in 2007 versus 832 million in 1995 148 the 2009 fao estimates showed an even more dramatic increase to 1.02 billion 149 environmental impacts edit illegal slash-and-burn agriculture in madagascar 2010 a number of scientists have argued that the current global population expansion and accompanying increase in resource consumption threatens the world s ecosystem 150 151 the interacademy panel statement on population growth which was ratified by 58 member national academies in 1994 states that unprecedented population growth aggravates many environmental problems including rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide global warming and pollution 152 indeed some analysts claim that overpopulation s most serious impact is its effect on the environment 15 the situation has continued to worsen as at the time of the 1994 iap statement the world population stood at 5.5 billion and lower-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050 a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s scientists contend that human overpopulation continued human population growth and overconsumption particularly by the wealthy are the primary drivers of mass species extinction 153 154 155 156 by 2050 population growth along with profligate consumption could result in oceans containing more plastic than fish by weight 155 in november 2017 a statement by 15,364 scientists from 184 countries asserted that rapid human population growth is the primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats 157 a july 2017 study published in environmental research letters argued that the most significant way individuals could mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children followed by living without a vehicle forgoing air travel and adopting a plant-based diet 158 population control edit india is predicted to overtake china as the world s most populous country by 2022 human population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth historically human population control has been implemented by limiting a region s birth rate by voluntary contraception or by government mandate it has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty environmental concerns and religious reasons the use of abortion in some population control strategies has caused controversy 159 with religious organizations such as the roman catholic church explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process 160 the university of nebraska publication green illusions argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive it states that women who are educated economically engaged and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet 161 the book fatal misconception by matthew connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time 162 overpopulation skepticism edit the population research institute pri an anti-abortion anti-contraception advocacy group has criticised predictions of overpopulation and attendant resource scarcity with some describing overpopulation as a myth 163 the pri argues that advances in agricultural medical and industrial technology have allowed global economic productivity to keep pace with rising populations despite malthusian predictions to the contrary pri further says that family sizes are naturally declining worldwide due to higher living standards increased availability of contraception and better economic opportunities for women however other commentators have described pri s arguments on overpopulation as deceptive 164 165 166 number of humans who have ever lived edit estimates of the total number of humans who have ever lived range in the order of 100 billion it is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties on the order of 3 to 5 167 kapitza 1996 cites estimates ranging between 80 and 150 billion 168 haub 1995 prepared another figure updated in 2002 and 2011 the 2011 figure was approximately 107 billion 18 19 169 haub characterized this figure as an estimate that required selecting population sizes for different points from antiquity to the present and applying assumed birth rates to each period 19 robust population data only exists for the last two or three centuries until the late 18th century few governments had ever performed an accurate census in many early attempts such as in ancient egypt and the persian empire the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service 170 thus there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations another critical factor for such an estimate is the question of pre-modern infant mortality rates these figures are very difficult to estimate for ancient times due to a lack of accurate records haub 1995 estimates that around 40 of those who have ever lived did not survive beyond their first birthday haub also stated that life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history 19 see also
