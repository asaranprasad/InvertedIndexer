geologic time scale - wikipedia geologic time scale from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from geological time jump to navigation search this clock representation shows some of the major units of geological time and definitive events of earth history the hadean eon represents the time before fossil record of life on earth its upper boundary is now regarded as 4.0 ga billion years ago 1 other subdivisions reflect the evolution of life the archean and proterozoic are both eons the palaeozoic mesozoic and cenozoic are eras of the phanerozoic eon the three million year quaternary period the time of recognizable humans is too small to be visible at this scale the geologic time scale gts is a system of chronological dating that relates geological strata stratigraphy to time it is used by geologists paleontologists and other earth scientists to describe the timing and relationships of events that have occurred during earth s history the tables of geologic time spans presented here agree with the nomenclature dates and standard color codes set forth by the international commission on stratigraphy ics contents 1 terminology 2 rationale 3 history and nomenclature of the time scale 3.1 early history 3.2 establishment of primary principles 3.3 formulation of geologic time scale 3.4 naming of geologic periods eras and epochs 3.5 dating of time scales 3.6 the anthropocene 4 table of geologic time 4.1 proposed precambrian timeline 5 see also 6 notes 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links terminology edit the primary defined divisions of time are eons in sequence the hadean the archean the proterozoic and the phanerozoic the first three of these can be referred to collectively as the precambrian supereon eons are divided into eras which are in turn divided into periods epochs and ages the following four timelines show the geologic time scale the first shows the entire time from the formation of the earth to the present but this gives little space for the most recent eon therefore the second timeline shows an expanded view of the most recent eon in a similar way the most recent era is expanded in the third timeline and the most recent period is expanded in the fourth timeline millions of years corresponding to eons eras periods epochs and ages the terms eonothem erathem system series stage are used to refer to the layers of rock that belong to these stretches of geologic time in earth s history geologists qualify these units as early mid and late when referring to time and lower middle and upper when referring to the corresponding rocks for example the lower jurassic series in chronostratigraphy corresponds to the early jurassic epoch in geochronology 2 the adjectives are capitalized when the subdivision is formally recognized and lower case when not thus early miocene but early jurassic rationale edit evidence from radiometric dating indicates that earth is about 4.54 billion years old 3 4 the geology or deep time of earth s past has been organized into various units according to events which took place different spans of time on the gts are usually marked by corresponding changes in the composition of strata which indicate major geological or paleontological events such as mass extinctions for example the boundary between the cretaceous period and the paleogene period is defined by the cretaceous paleogene extinction event which marked the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs and many other groups of life older time spans which predate the reliable fossil record before the proterozoic eon are defined by their absolute age geologic units from the same time but different parts of the world often look different and contain different fossils so the same time-span was historically given different names in different locales for example in north america the lower cambrian is called the waucoban series that is then subdivided into zones based on succession of trilobites in east asia and siberia the same unit is split into alexian atdabanian and botomian stages a key aspect of the work of the international commission on stratigraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal horizons that can be used around the world 5 some other planets and moons in the solar system have sufficiently rigid structures to have preserved records of their own histories for example venus mars and the earth s moon dominantly fluid planets such as the gas giants do not preserve their history in a comparable manner apart from the late heavy bombardment events on other planets probably had little direct influence on the earth and events on earth had correspondingly little effect on those planets construction of a time scale that links the planets is therefore of only limited relevance to the earth s time scale except in a solar system context the existence timing and terrestrial effects of the late heavy bombardment is still debated a

in rocks resembled those found on beaches he inferred that the fossils in rocks were formed by living animals and he reasoned that the positions of land and sea had changed over long periods of time leonardo da vinci 1452 1519 concurred with aristotle s interpretation that fossils represented the remains of ancient life 6 the 11th-century persian geologist avicenna ibn sina died 1037 and the 13th-century dominican bishop albertus magnus died 1280 extended aristotle s explanation into a theory of a petrifying fluid 7 avicenna also first proposed one of the principles underlying geologic time scales the law of superposition of strata while discussing the origins of mountains in the book of healing 1027 8 9 the chinese naturalist shen kuo 1031 1095 also recognized the concept of deep time 10 establishment of primary principles edit in the late 17th century nicholas steno 1638 1686 pronounced the principles underlying geologic geological time scales steno argued that rock layers or strata were laid down in succession and that each represents a slice of time he also formulated the law of superposition which states that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it while steno s principles were simple applying them proved challenging over the course of the 18th century geologists realized that sequences of strata often become eroded distorted tilted or even inverted after deposition strata laid down at the same time in different areas could have entirely different appearances the strata of any given area represented only part of earth s long history the neptunist theories popular at this time expounded by abraham werner 1749 1817 in the late 18th century proposed that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood a major shift in thinking came when james hutton presented his theory of the earth or an investigation of the laws observable in the composition dissolution and restoration of land upon the globe 11 before the royal society of edinburgh in march and april 1785 it has been said by whom that as things appear from the perspective of the 20th century james hutton in those readings became the founder of modern geology 12 95-100 hutton proposed that the interior of earth was hot and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea heat then consolidated the sediment into stone and uplifted it into new lands this theory known as plutonism stood in contrast to the neptunist flood-oriented theory formulation of geologic time scale edit the first serious attempts to formulate a geologic time scale that could be applied anywhere on earth were made in the late 18th century the most influential of those early attempts championed by werner among others divided the rocks of earth s crust into four types primary secondary tertiary and quaternary each type of rock according to the theory formed during a specific period in earth history it was thus possible to speak of a tertiary period as well as of tertiary rocks indeed tertiary now paleogene and neogene remained in use as the name of a geological period well into the 20th century and quaternary remains in formal use as the name of the current period the identification of strata by the fossils they contained pioneered by william smith georges cuvier jean d omalius d halloy and alexandre brongniart in the early 19th century enabled geologists to divide earth history more precisely it also enabled them to correlate strata across national or even continental boundaries if two strata however distant in space or different in composition contained the same fossils chances were good that they had been laid down at the same time detailed studies between 1820 and 1850 of the strata and fossils of europe produced the sequence of geologic periods still used today naming of geologic periods eras and epochs edit early work on developing the geologic time scale was dominated by british geologists and the names of the geologic periods reflect that dominance the cambrian the classical name for wales and the ordovician and silurian named after ancient welsh tribes were periods defined using stratigraphic sequences from wales 12 113 114 the devonian was named for the english county of devon and the name carboniferous was an adaptation of the coal measures the old british geologists term for the same set of strata the permian was named after perm russia because it was defined using strata in that region by scottish geologist roderick murchison however some periods were defined by geologists from other countries the triassic was named in 1834 by a german geologist friedrich von alberti from the three distinct layers latin trias meaning triad red beds capped by chalk followed by black shales that are found throughout germany and northwest europe called the trias the jurassic was named by a french geologist alexandre brongniart for the extensive marine limestone exposures of the jura mountains the cretaceous from latin creta meaning chalk as a separate period was first defined by belgian geologist jean d omalius d halloy in 1822 using strata in the paris basin 13 and named for the extensive beds of chalk calcium carbonate deposited by the shells of marine invertebrates found in western europe british geologists were also responsible for the grouping of periods into eras and the subdivision of the tertiary and quaternary periods into epochs in 1841 john phillips published the first global geologic time scale based on the types of fossils found in each era phillips scale helped standardize the use of terms like paleozoic old life which he extended to cover a larger period than it had in previous usage and mesozoic middle life which he invented 14 dating of time scales edit when william smith and sir charles lyell first recognized that rock strata represented successive time periods time scales could be estimated only very imprecisely since estimates of rates of change were uncertain while creationists had been proposing dates of around six or seven thousand years for the age of earth based on the bible early geologists were suggesting millions of years for geologic periods and some were even suggesting a virtually infinite age for earth citation needed geologists and paleontologists constructed the geologic table based on the relative positions of different strata and fossils and estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various kinds of weathering erosion sedimentation and lithification until the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 and the development of its geological applications through radiometric dating during the first half of the 20th century the ages of various rock strata and the age of earth were the subject of considerable debate the first geologic time scale that included absolute dates was published in 1913 by the british geologist arthur holmes 15 he greatly furthered the newly created discipline of geochronology and published the world-renowned book the age of the earth in which he estimated earth s age to be at least 1.6 billion years 16 in 1977 the global commission on stratigraphy now the international commission on stratigraphy began to define global references known as gssp global boundary stratotype sections and points for geologic periods and faunal stages the commission s most recent work is described in the 2004 geologic time scale of gradstein et al 17 a uml model for how the timescale is structured relating it to the gssp is also available 18 19 the anthropocene edit the term anthropocene is used informally by popular culture and a growing number of scientists to describe the current epoch in which we are living the term was coined by paul crutzen and eugene stoermer in 2000 to describe the current time in which humans have had an enormous impact on the environment it has evolved to describe an epoch starting some time in the past and on the whole defined by anthropogenic carbon emissions and production and consumption of plastic goods that are left in the ground 20 critics of this term say that the term should not be used because it is difficult if not nearly impossible to define a specific time when humans started influencing the rock strata defining the start of an epoch 21 others say that humans have not even started to leave their biggest impact on earth and therefore the anthropocene has not even started yet as of september 2015 the ics has not officially approved the term 22 the anthropocene working group met in oslo in april 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument for the anthropocene as a true geologic epoch 23 evidence was evaluated and the group voted to recommend anthropocene as the new geological age in august 2016 24 should the international commission on stratigraphy approve the recommendation the proposal to adopt the term will have to be ratified by the international union of geological sciences before its formal adoption as part of the geologic time scale 25 table of geologic time edit the following table summarizes the major events and characteristics of the periods of time making up the geologic time scale this table is arranged with the most recent geologic periods at the top and the most ancient at the bottom the height of each table entry does not correspond to the duration of each subdivision of time the content of the table is based on the current official geologic time scale of the international commission

timeline of paleontology notes edit not enough is known about extra-solar planets for worthwhile speculation paleontologists often refer to faunal stages rather than geologic geological periods the stage nomenclature is quite complex for a time-ordered list of faunal stages see 29 a b dates are slightly uncertain with differences of a few percent between various sources being common this is largely due to uncertainties in radiometric dating and the problem that deposits suitable for radiometric dating seldom occur exactly at the places in the geologic column where they would be most useful the dates and errors quoted above are according to the international commission on stratigraphy 2015 time scale except the hadean eon where errors are not quoted errors are less than the precision of the age given indicates boundaries where a global boundary stratotype section and point has been internationally agreed upon references to the post-cambrian supereon are not universally accepted and therefore must be considered unofficial historically the cenozoic has been divided up into the quaternary and tertiary sub-eras as well as the neogene and paleogene periods the 2009 version of the ics time chart 30 recognizes a slightly extended quaternary as well as the paleogene and a truncated neogene the tertiary having been demoted to informal status a b c d e f for more

also known as cryptozoic a b c d e f g h i j k l m n the proterozoic archean and hadean are often collectively referred to as the precambrian time or sometimes also the cryptozoic a b c d e f g h i j k l defined by absolute age global standard stratigraphic age the age of the oldest measurable craton or continental crust is dated to 3,600 3,800 ma though commonly used the hadean is not a formal eon and no lower bound for the archean and eoarchean have been agreed upon the hadean has also sometimes been called the priscoan or the azoic sometimes the hadean can be found to be subdivided according to the lunar geologic timescale these eras include the cryptic and basin groups which are subdivisions of the pre-nectarian era nectarian and early imbrian units a b c d these unit names were taken from the lunar geologic timescale and refer to geologic events that did not occur on earth their use for earth geology is unofficial note that their start times do not dovetail perfectly
