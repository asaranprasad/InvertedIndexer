lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile pure nickel powdered to maximize the reactive surface area shows a significant chemical activity but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion passivation even so pure native nickel is found in earth s crust only in tiny amounts usually in ultramafic rocks 4 5 and in the interiors of larger nickel iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside earth s atmosphere meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis an iron nickel mixture is thought to compose earth s inner core 6 use of nickel as a natural meteoric nickel iron alloy has been traced as far back as 3500 bce nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by axel fredrik cronstedt who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral in the cobalt mines of los h lsingland sweden the element s name comes from a mischievous sprite of german miner mythology nickel similar to old nick who personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper an economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite which often contains 1 2 nickel nickel s other important ore minerals include pentlandite and a mixture of ni-rich natural silicates known as garnierite major production sites include the sudbury region in canada which is thought to be of meteoric origin new caledonia in the pacific and norilsk in russia nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered corrosion-resistant historically it has been used for plating iron and brass coating chemistry equipment and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish such as german silver about 9 of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy nickel has been widely used in coins though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years nickel is one of four elements the others are iron cobalt and gadolinium 7 that are ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets the metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys about 68 of world production is used in stainless steel a further 10 is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys 7 for alloy steels 3 in foundries 9 in plating and 4 in other applications including the fast-growing battery sector 8 as a compound nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses such as a catalyst for hydrogenation cathodes for batteries pigments and metal surface treatments 9 nickel is an essential nutrient for some

slight golden tinge that takes a high polish it is one of only four elements that are magnetic at or near room temperature the others being iron cobalt and gadolinium its curie temperature is 355 c 671 f meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature 11 the unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352 nm giving an atomic radius of 0.124 nm this crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70 gpa nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile electron configuration dispute edit the nickel atom has two electron configurations ar 3d8 4s2 and ar 3d9 4s1 which are very close in energy the symbol ar refers to the argon-like core structure there is some disagreement on which configuration has the lowest energy 12 chemistry textbooks quote the electron configuration of nickel as ar 4s2 3d8 13 which can also be written ar 3d8 4s2 14 this configuration agrees with the madelung energy ordering rule which predicts that 4s is filled before 3d it is supported by the experimental fact that the lowest energy state of the nickel atom is a 3d8 4s2 energy level specifically the 3d8 3f 4s2 3f j 4 level 15 however each of these two configurations splits into several energy levels due to fine structure 15 and the two sets of energy levels overlap the average energy of states with configuration ar 3d9 4s1 is actually lower than the average energy of states with configuration ar 3d8 4s2 for this reason the research literature on atomic calculations quotes the ground state configuration of nickel as ar 3d9 4s1 12 isotopes edit the isotopes of nickel range in atomic weight from 48 u 48 ni to 78 u 78 ni naturally occurring nickel is composed of five stable isotopes 58 ni 60 ni 61 ni 62 ni and 64 ni with 58 ni being the most abundant 68.077 natural abundance isotopes heavier than 62 ni cannot be formed by nuclear fusion without losing energy nickel-62 has the highest mean nuclear binding energy per nucleon of any nuclide at 8.7946 mev nucleon 16 its binding energy is greater than both 56 fe and 58 fe more abundant elements often incorrectly cited as having the most tightly-bound nuclides 17 although this would seem to predict nickel-62 as the most abundant heavy element in the universe the relatively high rate of photodisintegration of nickel in stellar interiors causes iron to be by far the most abundant 17 stable isotope nickel-60 is the daughter product of the extinct radionuclide 60 fe which decays with a half-life of 2.6 million years because 60 fe has such a long half-life its persistence in materials in the solar system may generate observable variations in the isotopic composition of 60 ni therefore the abundance of 60 ni present in extraterrestrial material may provide insight into the origin of the solar system and its early history some 18 nickel radioisotopes have been characterised the most stable being 59 ni with a half-life of 76,000 years 63 ni with 100 years and 56 ni with 6 days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 60 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 30 seconds this element also has one meta state 18 radioactive nickel-56 is produced by the silicon burning process and later set free in large quantities during type ia supernovae the shape of the light curve of these supernovae at intermediate to late-times corresponds to the decay via electron capture of nickel-56 to cobalt-56 and ultimately to iron-56 19 nickel-59 is a long-lived cosmogenic radionuclide with a half-life of 76,000 years 59 ni has found many applications in isotope geology 59 ni has been used to date the terrestrial age of meteorites and to determine abundances of extraterrestrial dust in ice and sediment nickel-78 s half-life was recently measured at 110 milliseconds and is believed an important isotope in supernova nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron 20 the nuclide 48ni discovered in 1999 is the most proton-rich heavy element isotope known with 28 protons and 20 neutrons 48ni is double magic as is 78 ni with 28 protons and 50 neutrons both are therefore unusually stable for nuclides with so large a proton-neutron imbalance 18 21 occurrence edit widmanst tten pattern showing the two forms of nickel-iron kamacite and taenite in an octahedrite meteorite on earth nickel occurs most often in combination with sulfur and iron in pentlandite with sulfur in millerite with arsenic in the mineral nickeline and with arsenic and sulfur in nickel galena 22 nickel is commonly found in iron meteorites as the alloys kamacite and taenite the bulk of the nickel is mined from two types of ore deposits the first is laterite where the principal ore mineral mixtures are nickeliferous limonite fe ni o oh and garnierite a mixture of various hydrous nickel and nickel-rich silicates the second is magmatic sulfide deposits where the principal ore mineral is pentlandite ni fe 9s 8 australia and new caledonia have the biggest estimate reserves 45 all together 23 identified land-based resources throughout the world averaging 1 nickel or greater comprise at least 130 million tons of nickel about the double of known reserves about 60 is in laterites and 40 in sulfide deposits 23 on geophysical evidence most of the nickel on earth is believed to be in the earth s outer and inner cores kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel for kamacite the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90 10 to 95 5 although impurities such as cobalt or carbon may be present while for taenite the nickel content is between 20 and 65 kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites 24 compounds edit tetracarbonyl nickel the most common oxidation state of nickel is 2 but compounds of ni0 ni and ni3 are well known and the exotic oxidation states ni2 ni1 and ni4 have been produced and studied 25 nickel 0 edit nickel tetracarbonyl ni co 4 discovered by ludwig mond 26 is a volatile highly toxic liquid at room temperature on heating the complex decomposes back to nickel and carbon monoxide ni co 4 ni 4 co this behavior is exploited in the mond process for purifying nickel as described above the related nickel 0 complex bis cyclooctadiene nickel 0 is a useful catalyst in organonickel chemistry because the cyclooctadiene or cod ligands are easily displaced nickel i edit nickel i complexes are uncommon but one example is the tetrahedral complex nibr pph3 3 many nickel i complexes feature ni-ni bonding such as the dark red diamagnetic k 4 ni 2 cn 6 prepared by reduction of k 2 ni 2 cn 6 with sodium amalgam this compound is oxidised in water liberating h 2 27 it is thought that the nickel i oxidation state is important to nickel-containing enzymes such as nife -hydrogenase which catalyzes the reversible reduction of protons to h 2 28 structure of ni 2 cn 6 4 ion 27 nickel ii edit color of various ni ii complexes in aqueous solution from left to right ni nh 3 6 2 ni c2h4 nh2 2 2 nicl 4 2 ni h 2o 6 2 crystals of hydrated nickel sulfate nickel ii forms compounds with all common anions including sulfide sulfate carbonate hydroxide carboxylates and halides nickel ii sulfate is produced in large quantities by dissolving nickel metal or oxides in sulfuric acid forming both a hexa- and heptahydrates 29 useful for electroplating nickel common salts of nickel such as the chloride nitrate and sulfate dissolve in water to give green solutions of the metal aquo complex ni h 2o 6 2 the four halides form nickel compounds which are solids with molecules that feature octahedral ni centres nickel ii chloride is most common and its behavior is illustrative of the other halides nickel ii chloride is produced by dissolving nickel or its oxide in hydrochloric acid it is usually encountered as the green hexahydrate the formula of which is usually written nicl2 6h2o when dissolved in water this salt forms the metal aquo complex ni h 2o 6 2 dehydration of nicl2 6h2o gives the yellow anhydrous nicl 2 some tetracoordinate nickel ii complexes e g bis triphenylphosphine nickel chloride exist both in tetrahedral and square planar geometries the tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic whereas the square planar complexes are diamagnetic in having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of octahedral complexes they contrast with the divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals palladium ii and platinum ii which form only square-planar geometry 25 nickelocene is known it has an electron count of 20 making it relatively unstable nickel iii antimonide nickel iii and iv edit numerous ni iii compounds are known with the first such examples being nickel iii trihalophosphines niiii pph3 x3 30 further ni iii forms simple salts with fluoride 31 or oxide ions ni iii can be stabilized by -donor ligands such as thiols and phosphines 27 ni iv is present in the mixed oxide banio 3 while ni iii is present in nickel iii oxide which is used as the cathode in many rechargeable batteries including nickel-cadmium nickel-iron nickel hydrogen and nickel-metal hydride and used by certain manufacturers in li-ion batteries 32 ni iv remains a rare oxidation state of nickel and very few compounds are known to date 33 34 35 36 history edit because the ores of nickel are easily mistaken for ores of silver understanding of this metal and its use dates to relatively recent times however the unintentional use of nickel is ancient and can be traced back as far as 3500 bce bronzes from what is now syria have been found to contain as much as 2 nickel 37 some ancient chinese manuscripts suggest that white copper cupronickel known as baitong was used there between 1700 and 1400 bce this paktong white copper was exported to britain as early as the 17th century but the nickel content of this alloy was not discovered until 1822 38 coins of nickel-copper alloy were minted by the bactrian kings agathocles euthydemus ii and pantaleon in the 2nd century bce possibly out of the chinese cupronickel 39 nickeline niccolite in medieval germany a red mineral was found in the erzgebirge ore mountains that resembled copper ore however when miners were unable to extract any copper from it they blamed a mischievous sprite of german mythology nickel similar to old nick for besetting the copper they called this ore kupfernickel from the german kupfer for copper 40 41 42 43 this ore is now known to be nickeline aka niccolite a nickel arsenide in 1751 baron axel fredrik cronstedt tried to extract copper from kupfernickel at a cobalt mine in the swedish village of los and instead produced a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral nickel 44 in modern german kupfernickel or kupfer-nickel designates the alloy cupronickel originally the only source for nickel was the rare kupfernickel beginning in 1824 nickel was obtained as a byproduct of cobalt blue production the first large-scale smelting of nickel began in norway in 1848 from nickel-rich pyrrhotite the introduction of nickel in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for nickel and the nickel deposits of new caledonia discovered in 1865 provided most of the world s supply between 1875 and 1915 the discovery of the large deposits in the sudbury basin canada in 1883 in norilsk-talnakh russia in 1920 and in the merensky reef south africa in 1924 made large-scale production of nickel possible 38 coinage edit dutch coins made of pure nickel aside from the aforementioned bactrian coins nickel was not a component of coins until the mid-19th century canada edit 99.9 nickel five-cent coins were struck in canada the world s largest nickel producer at the time during non-war years from 1922 1981 the metal content made these coins magnetic 45 during the wartime period 1942 45 most or all nickel was removed from canadian and u s coins to save it for manufacturing armor 41 46 canada used 99.9 nickel from 1968 in its higher-value coins until 2000 switzerland edit coins of nearly pure nickel were first used in 1881 in switzerland 47 united kingdom edit birmingham forged nickel coins in about 1833 for trading in malaya 48 united states edit in the united states the term nickel or nick originally applied to the copper-nickel flying eagle cent which replaced copper with 12 nickel 1857 58 then the indian head cent of the same alloy from 1859 1864 still later in 1865 the term designated the three-cent nickel with nickel increased to 25 in 1866 the five-cent shield nickel 25 nickel 75 copper appropriated the designation along with the alloy proportion this term has been used to the present in the united states current use edit in the 21st century the high price of nickel has led to some replacement of the metal in coins around the world coins still made with nickel alloys include one- and two-euro coins 5 10 25 and 50 u s coins and 20p 50p 1 and 2 uk coins nickel-alloy in 5p and 10p uk coins was replaced with nickel-plated steel began in 2012 causing allergy problems for some people and public controversy 47 world production edit time trend of nickel production 49 nickel ores grade evolution in some leading nickel producing countries around 2 million tonnes of nickel are produced annually worldwide 50 the philippines indonesia russia canada and australia are the world s largest producers of nickel as reported by the us geological survey 23 the largest deposits of nickel in non-russian europe are located in finland and greece identified land-based resources averaging 1 nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons of nickel about 60 is in laterites and 40 is in sulfide deposits in addition extensive deep-sea resources of nickel are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of the ocean floor particularly in the pacific ocean 51 the one locality in the united states where nickel has been profitably mined is riddle oregon where several square miles of nickel-bearing garnierite surface deposits are located the mine closed in 1987 52 53 the eagle mine project is a new nickel mine in

metallurgy it is extracted from the ore by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75 purity in many stainless steel applications 75 pure nickel can be used without further purification depending on the impurities traditionally most sulfide ores have been processed using pyrometallurgical techniques to produce a matte for further refining recent advances in hydrometallurgical techniques resulted in significantly purer metallic nickel product most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction in hydrometallurgical processes nickel sulfide ores are concentrated with flotation differential flotation if ni fe ratio is too low and then smelted the nickel matte is further processed with the sherritt-gordon process first copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide leaving a concentrate of cobalt and nickel then solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel with the final nickel content greater than 99 electrolytically refined nickel nodule with green crystallized nickel-electrolyte salts visible in the pores electrorefining edit a second common refining process is leaching the metal matte into a nickel salt solution followed by the electro-winning of the nickel from solution by plating it onto a cathode as electrolytic nickel mond process edit highly purified nickel spheres made by the mond process the purest metal is obtained from nickel oxide by the mond process which achieves a purity of greater than 99.99 59 the process was patented by ludwig mond and has been in industrial use since before the beginning of the 20th century in this process nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide in the presence of a sulfur catalyst at around 40 80 c to form nickel carbonyl iron gives iron pentacarbonyl too but this reaction is slow if necessary the nickel may be separated by distillation dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in nickel distillation as a by-product but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non-volatile solid 60 nickel is obtained from nickel carbonyl by one of two processes it may be passed through a large chamber at high temperatures in which tens of thousands of nickel spheres called pellets are constantly stirred the carbonyl decomposes and deposits pure nickel onto the nickel spheres in the alternate process nickel carbonyl is decomposed in a smaller chamber at 230 c to create a fine nickel powder the byproduct carbon monoxide is recirculated and reused the highly pure nickel product is known as carbonyl nickel 61 metal value edit the market price of nickel surged throughout 2006 and the early months of 2007 as of april 5 2007 the metal was trading at us 52,300 tonne or 1.47 oz 62 the price subsequently fell dramatically and as of september 2017 the metal was trading at 11,000 tonne or 0.31 oz 63 the us nickel coin contains 0.04 ounces 1.1 g of nickel which at the april 2007 price was worth 6.5 cents along with 3.75 grams of copper worth about 3 cents with a total metal value of more than 9 cents since the face value of a nickel is 5 cents this made it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals at a profit however the united states mint in anticipation of this practice implemented new interim rules on december 14 2006 subject to public comment for 30 days which criminalized the melting and export of cents and nickels 64 violators can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 and or imprisoned for a maximum of five years as of september 19 2013 the melt value of a u s nickel copper and nickel included is 0.045 which is 90 of the face value 65 applications edit nickel superalloy jet engine rb199 turbine blade the global production of nickel is presently used as follows 68 in stainless steel 10 in nonferrous alloys 9 in electroplating 7 in alloy steel 3 in foundries and 4 other uses including batteries 8 nickel is used in many specific and recognizable industrial and consumer products including stainless steel alnico magnets coinage rechargeable batteries electric guitar strings microphone capsules plating on plumbing fixtures 66 and special alloys such as permalloy elinvar and invar it is used for plating and as a green tint in glass nickel is preeminently an alloy metal and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons in which it typically increases the tensile strength toughness and elastic limit it is widely used in many other alloys including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper chromium aluminium lead cobalt silver and gold inconel incoloy monel nimonic 67 a horseshoe magnet made of alnico nickel alloy because it is resistant to corrosion nickel was occasionally used as a substitute for decorative silver nickel was also occasionally used in some countries after 1859 as a cheap coinage metal see above but in the later years of the 20th century was replaced by cheaper stainless steel i e iron alloys except in the united states and canada nickel is an excellent alloying agent for certain precious metals and is used in the fire assay as a collector of platinum group elements pge as such nickel is capable of fully collecting all 6 pge elements from ores and of partially collecting gold high-throughput nickel mines may also engage in pge recovery primarily platinum and palladium examples are norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin in canada nickel foam or nickel mesh is used in gas diffusion electrodes for alkaline fuel cells 68 69 nickel and its alloys are frequently used as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions raney nickel a finely divided nickel-aluminium alloy is one common form though related catalysts are also used including raney-type catalysts nickel is a naturally magnetostrictive material meaning that in the presence of a magnetic field the material undergoes a small change in length 70 71 the magnetostriction of nickel is on the order of 50 ppm and is negative indicating that it contracts nickel is used as a binder in the cemented tungsten carbide or hardmetal industry and used in proportions of 6 to 12 by weight nickel makes the tungsten carbide magnetic and adds corrosion-resistance to the cemented parts although the hardness is less than those with a cobalt binder 72 63 ni with its half-life of 100.1 years is useful in krytron devices as a beta particle high-speed electron emitter to make ionization by the keep-alive electrode more reliable 73 around 27 of all nickel production is destined for engineering 10 for building and construction 14 for tubular products 20 for metal goods 14 for transport 11 for electronic goods and 5 for other uses 8 biological role edit although not recognized until the 1970s nickel is known to play an important role in the biology of some plants eubacteria archaebacteria and fungi 74 75 76 nickel enzymes such as urease are considered virulence factors in some organisms 77 78 urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbamate 75 74 the nife hydrogenases can catalyze the oxidation of h 2 to form protons and electrons and can also catalyze the reverse reaction the reduction of protons to form hydrogen gas 75 74 a nickel-tetrapyrrole coenzyme cofactor f430 is present in methyl coenzyme m reductase which can catalyze the formation of methane or the reverse reaction in methanogenic archaea 79 one of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an fe-ni-s cluster 80 other nickel-bearing enzymes include a rare bacterial class of superoxide dismutase 81 and glyoxalase i enzymes in bacteria and several parasitic eukaryotic trypanosomal parasites 82 in higher organisms including yeast and mammals this enzyme contains divalent zn2 83 84 85 86 87 dietary nickel may affect human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria but it is also possible that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine in effect functioning as a prebiotic 88 the u s institute of medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans so neither a recommended dietary allowance rda nor an adequate intake have been established the tolerable upper intake level of dietary nickel is 1000 g day as soluble nickel salts dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 g day with less than 10 absorbed what is absorbed is excreted in urine 89 relatively large amounts of nickel comparable to the estimated average ingestion above leach into food cooked in stainless steel for example the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88 g 90 91 nickel released from siberian traps volcanic eruptions is suspected of assisting the growth of methanosarcina a genus of euryarchaeote archaea that produced methane during the permian triassic extinction event the biggest extinction event on record 92 toxicity edit oxidized nickel surface the major source of nickel exposure is oral consumption as nickel is essential to plants 93 nickel is found naturally in both food and water and may be increased by human pollution for example nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water nickel steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food the atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry shampoos detergents and coins a less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin the average daily exposure does not pose a threat to human health most of the nickel absorbed every day by humans is removed by the kidneys and passed out of the body through urine or is eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract without being absorbed nickel is not a cumulative poison but larger doses or chronic inhalation exposure may be toxic even carcinogenic and constitute an occupational hazard 94 nickel compounds are classified as human carcinogens 95 96 97 98 based on increased respiratory cancer risks observed in epidemiological studies of sulfidic ore refinery workers 99 this is supported by the positive results of the ntp bioassays with ni sub-sulfide and ni oxide in rats and mice 100 101 the human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation 102 103 nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen 95 96 97 there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel 99 and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder 104 in the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed 98 100 104 105 in rat studies oral ingestion of water-soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects in pregnant animals 106 whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects 107 108 109 110 people can be exposed to nickel in the workplace by inhalation ingestion and contact with skin or eye the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for the workplace at 1 mg m3 per 8-hour workday excluding nickel carbonyl the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh specifies the recommended exposure limit rel of 0.015 mg m3 per 8-hour workday at 10 mg m3 nickel is immediately dangerous to life and health 111 nickel carbonyl ni co 4 is an extremely toxic gas the toxicity of metal carbonyls is a function of both the toxicity of the metal and the off-gassing of carbon monoxide from the carbonyl functional groups nickel carbonyl is also explosive in air 112 113 sensitized individuals may show a skin contact allergy to nickel known as a contact dermatitis highly sensitized individuals may also react to foods with high nickel content 114 sensitivity to nickel may also be present in patients with pompholyx nickel is the top confirmed contact allergen worldwide partly due to its use in jewelry for pierced ears 115 nickel allergies affecting pierced ears are often marked by itchy red skin many earrings are now made without nickel or low-release nickel 116 to address this problem the amount allowed in products that contact human skin is now regulated by the european union in 2002 researchers found that the nickel released by 1 and 2 euro coins was far in excess of those standards this is believed to be the result of a galvanic reaction 117 nickel was voted allergen of the year in 2008 by the american contact dermatitis society 118 in august 2015 the american academy of dermatology adopted a position statement on the safety of nickel estimates suggest that contact dermatitis which includes nickel sensitization accounts for approximately 1.918 billion and affects nearly 72.29 million people 114 reports show that both the nickel-induced activation of hypoxia-inducible factor hif-1 and the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes are caused by depletion of intracellular ascorbate the addition of ascorbate to the culture medium increased the intracellular ascorbate level and reversed both the metal-induced stabilization of hif-1- and hif-1 -dependent gene expression 119 120 references edit meija j et al 2016 pure and applied chemistry 88 3 265 91 doi carnes matthew buccella daniela chen
