spheroid - wikipedia spheroid from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from oblate spheroid jump to navigation search example spheroids oblate prolate a spheroid or ellipsoid of revolution is a quadric surface obtained by rotating an ellipse about one of its principal axes in other words an ellipsoid with two equal semi-diameters if the ellipse is rotated about its major axis the result is a prolate elongated spheroid shaped like an american football or rugby ball if the ellipse is rotated about its minor axis the result is an oblate flattened spheroid shaped like a lentil if the generating ellipse is a circle the result is a sphere a spheroid has circular symmetry because of the combined effects of gravity and rotation the shape of the earth and of all planets is not quite a sphere but instead is slightly flattened in the direction of its axis of rotation for that reason in cartography the earth is often approximated by an oblate spheroid instead of a sphere the current world geodetic system model uses a spheroid whose radius is 6,378.137 km 3,963.191 mi at the equator and 6,356.752 km 3,949.903 mi at the poles the word spheroid originally meant an approximately spherical body admitting irregularities even beyond the bi- or tri-axial ellipsoidal shape and that is how the term is used in some older papers on geodesy for example referring to truncated spherical

along the coordinate axes is x 2 a 2 y 2 b 2 z 2 c 2 1 displaystyle frac x 2 a 2 frac y 2 b 2 frac z 2 c 2 1 the equation of a spheroid with z as the symmetry axis is given by setting a b x 2 y 2 a 2 z 2 c 2 1 displaystyle frac x 2 y 2 a 2 frac z 2 c 2 1 the semi-axis a is the equatorial radius of the spheroid and c is the distance from centre to pole along the symmetry axis there are two possible cases c a oblate spheroid c a prolate spheroid the case of a c reduces to a sphere properties edit area edit an oblate spheroid with c a has surface area s o b l a t e 2 a 2 1 1 e 2 e artanh e 2 a 2 c

the oblate spheroid is generated by rotation about the z-axis of an ellipse with semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis c therefore e may be identified as the eccentricity see ellipse 2 a prolate

c 2 the prolate spheroid is generated by rotation about the z-axis of an ellipse with semi-major axis c and semi-minor axis a therefore e may again be identified as the eccentricity see ellipse 3 these formulas are identical in the sense that the formula for soblate can be used to calculate the surface area of a prolate spheroid and vice versa however e then becomes imaginary and can no longer directly be identified with the eccentricity both of these results may be cast into many other forms using standard mathematical identities and relations between parameters of the ellipse volume edit

of the polar to equatorial lengths while the flattening also called oblateness f is the ratio of the equatorial-polar length difference to the equatorial length f a b a 1 b a displaystyle f frac a-b a 1- frac b a the first eccentricity usually simply eccentricity as above is often used instead of flattening 4 it is defined by e 1 b 2 a 2 displaystyle e sqrt 1- frac b 2 a 2 the relations between

axis giving the aspect ratio the flattening or the first eccentricity while these definitions are mathematically interchangeable real-world calculations must lose some precision to avoid confusion an ellipsoidal definition considers its own values to be exact in the form it gives applications edit the most common shapes for the density distribution of protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus are spherical prolate and oblate spheroidal where the polar axis is assumed to be the spin axis or direction of the spin angular momentum vector deformed nuclear shapes occur as a result of the competition between electromagnetic repulsion between protons surface tension and quantum shell effects oblate spheroids edit the planet jupiter is an oblate spheroid with flattening ratio 0.06487 the oblate spheroid is the approximate shape of many planets and celestial bodies including saturn jupiter and the quickly-spinning star altair in particular cartographic and geodetic systems for the earth are based on a reference ellipsoid an extreme example of an oblate planet in science fiction is mesklin in hal clement s novel mission of gravity prolate spheroids edit an australian rules football the prolate spheroid is the shape of the ball in several sports such as in rugby football several moons of the solar system approximate prolate spheroids in shape though they are actually triaxial ellipsoids examples are mimas enceladus and tethys satellites of saturn and miranda a satellite of uranus in contrast to being distorted into oblate spheroids via rapid rotation celestial objects distort slightly into prolate spheroids via tidal forces when they orbit a massive body in a close orbit the most extreme example is jupiter s moon io which becomes slightly more or less prolate in its orbit due to a slight eccentricity causing spectacular volcanism the major axis of the prolate spheroid does not run through the satellite s poles in this case but through the two points on its equator directly facing toward and away from the primary a famous example in science fiction is jinx in larry niven s known space the term is also used to describe the shape of some nebulae nebulas such as the crab nebula 5 the atomic nuclei of the actinide elements are shaped like prolate spheroids citation needed fresnel zones used to analyze wave propagation and interference in space are a series of concentric prolate spheroids with principal axes aligned along the direct line-of-sight between a transmitter and a receiver many submarines have a shape which can be
