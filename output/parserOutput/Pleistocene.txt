2017 1 in europe and north america the holocene is subdivided into preboreal boreal atlantic subboreal and subatlantic stages of the blytt sernander time scale there are many regional subdivisions for the upper or late pleistocene usually these represent locally recognized cold glacial and warm interglacial periods the last glacial period ends with the cold younger dryas substage the pleistocene pla st si n -to - 2 often colloquially referred to as the ice age is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago spanning the world s most recent period of repeated glaciations the end of the pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the paleolithic age used in archaeology the pleistocene is the first epoch of the quaternary period or sixth epoch of the cenozoic era 3 in the ics timescale the pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages the gelasian calabrian ionian and tarantian all of these stages were defined in southern europe in addition to this international subdivision various regional subdivisions are often used before a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the international union of geological sciences the time boundary between the pleistocene and the preceding pliocene was regarded as being at 1.806 million years before present bp as opposed to the currently accepted 2.588 million years bp

of repeated glaciation up to and including the younger dryas cold spell the end of the younger dryas has been dated to about 9640 bc 11,654 calendar years bp it was not until after the development of radiocarbon dating however that pleistocene archaeological excavations shifted to stratified caves and rock-shelters as opposed to open-air river-terrace sites 7 in 2009 the international union of geological sciences iugs confirmed a change in time period for the pleistocene changing the start date from 1.806 to 2.588 million years bp and accepted the base of the gelasian as the base of the

north polar area during the pleistocene period the modern continents were essentially at their present positions during the pleistocene the plates upon which they sit probably having moved no more than 100 km relative to each other since the beginning of the period according to mark lynas through collected data the pleistocene s overall climate could be characterized as a continuous el ni o with trade winds in the south pacific weakening or heading east warm air rising near peru warm water spreading from the west pacific and the indian ocean to the east pacific and other el ni o markers

remove this template message pleistocene climate was marked by repeated glacial cycles in which continental glaciers pushed to the 40th parallel in some places it is estimated that at maximum glacial extent 30 of the earth s surface was covered by ice in addition a zone of permafrost stretched southward from the edge of the glacial sheet a few hundred kilometres in north america and several hundred in eurasia the mean annual temperature at the edge of the ice was 6 c 21 f at the edge of the permafrost 0 c 32 f each glacial advance tied up huge volumes of water in continental ice sheets 1,500 to 3,000 metres 4,900 9,800 ft thick resulting in temporary sea-level drops of 100 metres 300 ft or more over the entire surface of the earth during interglacial times such as at present drowned coastlines were common mitigated by isostatic or other emergent motion of some regions the effects of glaciation were global antarctica was ice-bound throughout the pleistocene as well as the preceding pliocene the andes were covered in the south by the patagonian ice cap there were glaciers in new zealand and tasmania the current decaying glaciers of mount kenya mount kilimanjaro and the ruwenzori range in east and central africa were larger glaciers existed in the mountains of ethiopia and to the west in the atlas mountains in the northern hemisphere many glaciers fused into one the cordilleran ice sheet covered the north american northwest the east was covered by the laurentide the fenno-scandian ice sheet rested on northern europe including great britain the alpine ice sheet on the alps scattered domes stretched across siberia and the arctic shelf the northern seas were ice-covered south of the ice sheets large lakes accumulated because outlets were blocked and the cooler air slowed evaporation when the laurentide ice sheet retreated north central north america was totally covered by lake agassiz over a hundred basins now dry or nearly so were overflowing in the north american west lake bonneville for example stood where great salt lake now does in eurasia large lakes developed as a result of the runoff from the glaciers rivers were larger had a more copious flow and were braided african lakes were fuller apparently from decreased evaporation deserts on the other hand were drier and more extensive rainfall was lower because of the decreases in oceanic and other evaporation it has been estimated that during the pleistocene the east antarctic ice sheet thinned by at least 500 meters and that thinning since the last glacial maximum is less than 50 meters and probably started after ca 14 ka 13 major events edit ice ages as reflected in atmospheric co2 stored in bubbles from glacial ice of antarctica over 11 major glacial events have been identified as well as many minor glacial events 14 a major glacial event is a general glacial excursion termed a glacial glacials are separated by interglacials during a glacial the glacier experiences minor advances and retreats the minor excursion is a stadial times between stadials are interstadials these events are defined differently in different regions of the glacial range which have their own glacial history depending on latitude terrain and climate there is a general correspondence between glacials in different regions investigators often interchange the names if the glacial geology of a region is in the process of being defined however it is generally incorrect to apply the name of a glacial in one region to another for most of the 20th century only a few regions had been studied and the names were relatively few today the geologists of different nations are taking more of an interest in pleistocene glaciology as a consequence the number of names is expanding rapidly and will continue to expand many of the advances and stadials remain unnamed also the terrestrial evidence for some of them has been erased or obscured by larger ones but evidence remains from the study of cyclical climate changes the glacials in the following tables show historical usages are a simplification of a much more complex cycle of variation in climate and terrain and are generally no longer used these names have been abandoned in favor of numeric data because many of the correlations were found to be either inexact or incorrect and more than four major glacials have been recognized since the historical terminology was established 14 15 16 historical names of the four major glacials in four regions region glacial 1 glacial 2 glacial 3 glacial 4 alps g nz mindel riss w rm north europe

corresponding to the terms glacial and interglacial the terms pluvial and interpluvial are in use latin pluvia rain a pluvial is a warmer period of increased rainfall an interpluvial of decreased rainfall formerly a pluvial was thought to correspond to a glacial in regions not iced and in some cases it does rainfall is cyclical also pluvials and interpluvials are widespread there is no systematic correspondence of pluvials to glacials however moreover regional pluvials do not correspond to each other globally for example some have used the term riss pluvial in egyptian contexts any coincidence is an accident of regional factors only a few of the names for pluvials in restricted regions have been strategraphically defined palaeocycles edit the sum of transient factors acting at the earth s surface is cyclical climate ocean currents and other movements wind currents temperature etc the waveform response comes from the underlying cyclical motions of the planet which eventually drag all the transients into harmony with them the repeated glaciations of the pleistocene were caused by the same factors milankovitch cycles edit glaciation in the pleistocene was a series of glacials and interglacials stadials and interstadials mirroring periodic changes in climate the main factor at work in climate cycling is now believed to be milankovitch cycles these are periodic variations in regional and planetary solar radiation reaching the earth caused by several repeating changes in the earth s motion milankovitch cycles cannot be the sole factor responsible for the variations in climate since they explain neither the long term cooling trend over the plio-pleistocene nor the millennial variations in the greenland ice cores milankovitch pacing seems to best explain glaciation events with periodicity of 100,000 40,000 and 20,000 years such a pattern seems to fit the information on climate change found in oxygen isotope cores the timing of our present interglacial interval known as the holocene postglacial or the present interglacial to that of the previous interglacial beginning about 130,000 years ago the eemian interglacial suggests that the next glacial might begin in about 3,000 years citation needed oxygen isotope ratio cycles edit in oxygen isotope ratio analysis variations in the ratio of 18 o to 16 o two isotopes of oxygen by mass measured by a mass spectrometer present in the calcite of oceanic core samples is used as a diagnostic of ancient ocean temperature change and therefore of climate change cold oceans are richer in 18 o which is included in the tests of the microorganisms foraminifera contributing the calcite a more recent version of the sampling process makes use of modern glacial ice cores although less rich in 18 o than sea water the snow that fell on the glacier year by year nevertheless contained 18 o and 16 o in a ratio that depended on the mean annual temperature temperature and climate change are cyclical when plotted on a graph of temperature versus time temperature coordinates are given in the form of a deviation from today s annual mean temperature taken as zero this sort of graph is based on another of isotope ratio versus time ratios are converted to a percentage difference from the ratio found in standard mean ocean water smow the graph in either form appears as a waveform with overtones one half of a period is a marine isotopic stage mis it indicates a glacial below zero or an interglacial above zero overtones are stadials or interstadials according to this evidence earth

modern but with many more large land mammals such as mammoths mastodons diprotodon smilodon aurochs short-faced bear giant sloths gigantopithecus and others isolated places such as australia madagascar new zealand and islands in the pacific saw the evolution of large birds and even reptiles such as the elephant bird moa haast s eagle quinkana megalania and meiolania pleistocene of northern spain showing woolly mammoth cave lions eating a reindeer tarpans and woolly rhinoceros pleistocene of south america showing megatherium and two glyptodon the severe climatic changes during the ice age had major impacts on the fauna and flora with each advance of the ice large areas of the continents became totally depopulated and plants and animals retreating southwards in front of the advancing glacier faced tremendous stress the most severe stress resulted from drastic climatic changes reduced living space and curtailed food supply a major extinction event of large mammals megafauna which included mammoths mastodons saber-toothed cats glyptodons the woolly rhinoceros various giraffids such as the sivatherium ground sloths irish elk cave bears gomphothere dire wolves and short-faced bears began late in the pleistocene and continued into the holocene neanderthals also became extinct during this period at the end of the last ice age cold-blooded animals smaller mammals like wood mice migratory birds and swifter animals like whitetail deer had replaced the megafauna and migrated north the extinctions hardly affected africa but were especially severe in north america where native horses and camels were wiped out asian land mammal ages alma include zhoukoudianian nihewanian and yushean european land mammal ages elma include gelasian 2.5 1.8 ma north american land

entirely within the pleistocene humans edit the evolution of anatomically modern humans took place during the pleistocene 17 18 in the beginning of the pleistocene paranthropus species are still present as well as early human ancestors but during the lower palaeolithic they disappeared and the only hominin species found in fossilic records is homo erectus for much of the pleistocene acheulean lithics appear along with homo erectus some 1.8 million years ago replacing the more primitive oldowan industry used by a garhi and by the earliest species of homo the middle paleolithic saw more varied speciation within homo including the appearance of homo sapiens about 200,000 years ago according to mitochondrial timing techniques modern humans migrated from africa after the riss glaciation in the middle palaeolithic during the eemian stage spreading all over the ice-free world during the late pleistocene 19 20 21 a 2005 study posits that humans in this migration interbred with archaic human forms already outside of africa by the late pleistocene incorporating archaic human genetic material into the modern human gene pool 22 hominin species during pleistocene deposits edit pleistocene non-marine sediments are found primarily in fluvial deposits lakebeds slope and loess deposits as well as in the large amounts of material moved about by glaciers less common are cave deposits travertines and volcanic deposits lavas ashes pleistocene marine deposits are found primarily in shallow marine basins mostly but with important exceptions in areas within a few tens of
