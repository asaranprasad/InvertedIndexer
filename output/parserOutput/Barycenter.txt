barycenter - wikipedia barycenter from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search look up barycenter in wiktionary the free dictionary the barycenter or barycentre from the ancient greek heavy centre 1 is the center of mass of two or more bodies that are orbiting each other which is the point around which they both orbit it is an important concept in fields such as astronomy and astrophysics the distance from a body s center of mass to the barycenter can be calculated as a simple two-body problem in cases where one of the two objects is considerably more massive than the other and relatively close the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object rather than appearing to orbit a common center of mass with the smaller body the larger will simply be seen to wobble slightly this is the case for the earth moon system where the barycenter is located on average 4,671 km 2,902 mi from the earth s center well within the planet s radius of 6,378 km 3,963 mi when the two bodies are of similar masses the barycenter will generally be located between them and both bodies will follow an orbit around it this is the case for pluto and charon as well as for many binary asteroids and binary stars when the less massive object is far away the barycenter can be located outside the more massive object this is the case for jupiter and the sun despite the thousandfold difference in mass due to the relatively large distance between them the barycenter is outside the sun 2 in astronomy barycentric coordinates are non-rotating coordinates with the origin at the center of mass of two or more bodies the international celestial reference system is a barycentric one based on the barycenter of the solar system in geometry the term barycenter is synonymous with centroid the geometric center of a two-dimensional shape contents 1 two-body problem 1.1 primary secondary examples 1.2 inside or outside the sun 2 gallery 3 relativistic corrections 4 selected barycentric orbital elements 5 see also 6 references two-body problem edit barycentric view of the pluto charon system as seen by new horizons the barycenter is one of the foci of the elliptical orbit of each body this is an important concept in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics if a is the distance between the centers of the two bodies the semi-major axis of the system r1 is the semi-major axis of the primary s orbit around the barycenter and r2 a r1 is the semi-major axis of the secondary s orbit when the barycenter is located within the more massive body that body will appear to wobble rather than to follow a discernible orbit in a simple two-body case r1 the distance from the center of the primary to the barycenter is given by r 1 a m 2 m 1 m 2 a 1 m 1 m 2 displaystyle r 1 a cdot frac m 2 m 1 m 2 frac a 1 frac m 1 m 2 where r 1 is the distance from body 1 to the barycenter a is the distance between the centers of the two bodies m 1 and m 2 are the masses of the two bodies primary secondary examples edit the following table sets out some examples from the solar system figures are given rounded to three significant figures the term primary secondary is used to distinguish between involved participants with the larger called the primary and the smaller called the secondary m1 is the mass of the primary in earth masses m m2 is the mass of the secondary in earth masses m a km is the average orbital distance between the two bodies r1 km is the distance from the center of the primary to the barycenter r1 km is the radius the primary r1 r1 a value less

of the sun you would need to sum all the influences from all the planets comets asteroids etc of the solar system see n-body problem if all the planets were aligned on the same side of the sun the combined center of mass would lie about 500,000 km above the sun s surface the calculations above are based on the mean distance between the bodies and yield the mean value r1 but all celestial orbits are elliptical and the distance between the bodies varies between the apses depending on the eccentricity e hence the position of the barycenter varies too and it is possible in some systems for the barycenter to be sometimes inside and sometimes outside the more massive body this occurs where 1 1 e r 1 r 1 1 1 e displaystyle frac 1 1-e frac r 1 r 1 frac 1 1 e note that the sun jupiter system

radial-velocity method makes use of the star s wobble to detect extrasolar planets relativistic corrections edit in classical mechanics this definition simplifies calculations and introduces no known problems in general relativity problems arise because while it is possible within reasonable approximations to define the barycenter the associated coordinate system does not fully reflect the inequality of clock rates at different locations brumberg explains how to set up barycentric coordinates in general relativity 5 the coordinate systems involve a world-time i e a global time coordinate that could be set up by telemetry individual clocks of similar construction will not agree with this standard because they are subject to differing gravitational potentials or move at various velocities so the world-time must be slaved to some ideal clock that is assumed to be very far from the whole self-gravitating system this time standard is called barycentric coordinate time
