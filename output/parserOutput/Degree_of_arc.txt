arcdegree usually denoted by the degree symbol is a measurement of a plane angle defined so that a full rotation is 360 degrees it is not an si unit as the si unit of angular measure is the radian but it is mentioned in the si brochure as an accepted unit 4 because a full rotation equals 2 radians one degree is equivalent to 180 radians contents 1 history 2 subdivisions 3 alternative units 4 see also 5 notes 6 references 7 external links history edit a circle with an equilateral chord red one sixtieth of this arc is a degree six such chords complete the circle the original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown one theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year 5 ancient astronomers noticed that the sun which follows through the ecliptic path over the course of the year seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day some ancient calendars such as the persian calendar used 360 days for a year the use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of sexagesimal numbers another theory is that the babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle as the basic unit and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their sexagesimal numeric system 6 7 the earliest trigonometry used by the babylonian astronomers and their greek successors was based on chords of a circle a chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity one sixtieth of this using their standard sexagesimal divisions was a degree aristarchus of samos and hipparchus seem to have been among the first greek scientists to exploit babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically 8 9 timocharis aristarchus aristillus archimedes and hipparchus were the first greeks known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 arc minutes 10 eratosthenes used a simpler sexagesimal system dividing a circle into 60 parts the division of the circle into 360 parts also occurred in ancient india as evidenced in the rigveda 11 twelve spokes one wheel navels three who can comprehend this on it are placed together three hundred and sixty like pegs they shake not in the least dirghatamas rigveda 1.164.48 another motivation for choosing the number 360 may have been that it is readily divisible 360 has 24 divisors note 1 making it one of only 7 numbers such that no number less than twice as much has more divisors sequence a072938 in the oeis 12 13 furthermore it is divisible by every number from 1 to 10 except 7 note 2 this property has many useful applications such as dividing the world into 24 time zones each of which is nominally 15 of longitude to correlate with the established 24-hour day convention finally it may be the case that more than one of these factors has come into play according to that theory the number is approximately 365 because of the apparent movement of the sun against the celestial sphere and that it was rounded to 360 for some of the mathematical reasons cited above subdivisions edit for many practical purposes a degree is a small enough angle that whole degrees provide sufficient precision when this is not the case as in astronomy or for geographic coordinates latitude and longitude degree measurements may be written using decimal degrees with the degree symbol behind the decimals for example 40.1875 alternatively the traditional sexagesimal unit subdivisions can be used one degree is divided into 60 minutes of arc and one minute into 60 seconds of arc use of degrees-minutes-seconds is also called dms notation these subdivisions also called the arcminute and arcsecond are respectively represented by a single and double prime for example 40.1875 40 11 15 or using quotation mark characters 40 11 15 additional precision can be provided using decimals for the arcseconds component the older system of thirds fourths etc which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision was used by al-kashi and other ancient astronomers but is rarely used today these subdivisions were denoted citation needed by writing the roman numeral for the number of sixtieths in superscript 1i for a prime minute of arc 1ii for a second 1iii for a third 1iv for a fourth etc hence the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc and the word second also refer to this system citation needed alternative units edit a chart to convert between degrees and radians in most mathematical work beyond practical geometry angles are typically measured in radians rather than degrees this is for a variety of reasons for example the trigonometric functions have simpler and more natural properties when their arguments are expressed in radians these considerations outweigh the convenient divisibility of the number 360 one complete turn 360 is equal to 2 radians so 180 is equal to radians or equivalently the degree is a mathematical constant 1 180 the turn or revolution full circle full rotation cycle is used in technology and science one turn is equal to 360 with the invention of the metric system based on powers of ten there was an attempt to replace degrees by decimal degrees note 3 called grad or gon where the number in a right angle is equal to 100 gon with 400 gon in a full circle 1 10 9 gon although that idea was abandoned by napoleon grades continued to be used in several fields and many scientific calculators support them decigrades 1 4,000 were used with french artillery sights in world war i an angular mil which is most used in military applications has at least three specific variants ranging from 1 6,400 to 1 6,000 it is approximately equal to one milliradian c 1 6,283 a mil measuring 1 6,000 of a revolution originated in the imperial russian army where an equilateral chord was divided into tenths to give a circle of 600 units this may be seen on a lining plane an early device for aiming indirect fire artillery dating from about 1900 in
