substorm - wikipedia substorm from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a series of images made by ultraviolet light imager on the polar spacecraft showing the aurora and earth s upper atmosphere the glowing side is the atmosphere lit up by the sun s light energy and the oval of light is the aurora during a substorm the auroral oval brightens in a localized area and then suddenly breaks into many different forms that expand both toward earth s pole and equator this is exactly what shun-ichi akasofu 1964 drew in his auroral substorm illustration play media short video featuring commentary by david sibeck project scientist for the themis mission discussing a visualization of reconnection fronts a substorm sometimes referred to as a magnetospheric substorm or an auroral substorm is a brief disturbance in the earth s magnetosphere that causes energy to be released from the tail of the magnetosphere and injected into the high latitude ionosphere visually a substorm is seen as a sudden brightening and increased movement of auroral arcs substorms were first described in qualitative terms by kristian birkeland 1 which he called polar elementary storms sydney chapman used the term substorm about 1960 which is now the standard term the morphology of aurora during of a substorm was first described by syun-ichi akasofu in 1964 2 3 using data collected during the international geophysical year substorms 4 are distinct from geomagnetic storms in that the latter take place over a period of several days are observable from anywhere on earth inject a large number of ions into the outer radiation belt and occur once or twice a month during the maximum of the solar cycle and a few times a year during solar minimum substorms on the other hand take place over a period of a few hours are observable primarily at the polar regions do not inject many particles into the radiation belt and are relatively frequent often occurring only a few hours apart from each other substorms can be more intense and occur more frequently during a geomagnetic storm when one substorm may start before the previous one has completed the source of the magnetic disturbances observed at the earth s surface during geomagnetic storms is the ring current whereas the sources of magnetic disturbances observed on the ground during substorms are electric currents in the ionosphere at high latitudes 5 substorms can cause magnetic field disturbances in the auroral zones up to a magnitude of 1000 nt roughly 2 of the total magnetic field strength in that region the disturbance is much greater in space as some geosynchronous satellites have registered the magnetic field dropping to half of its normal strength during a substorm the most visible indication of a substorm is an increase in the intensity and size of polar auroras 5 substorms can be divided into three phases the growth phase the expansion phase and the recovery phase 6 in 2012 the themis satellite mission observed the dynamics of rapidly developing substorms confirming the existence of giant magnetic ropes and witnessed small explosions in the outskirts of earth s magnetic field 7 references edit birkeland kristian 1908 section 1 1913 section 2 new york and christiania now oslo h aschehoug co check date values in date help out-of-print full text online sarris t li x 30 march 2005 pdf annales geophysicae 23 877 884 bibcode doi akasofu s -i april 1964 the development of the auroral substorm planetary and space science 12 4 273 282 bibcode doi potemra t 1991 magnetospheric substorms washington d c am geophysical union p 488 isbn 0-87590-030-5 a b stern david p peredo mauricio 25 november 2001 retrieved 21 march 2010 southwest research institute retrieved 24 march 2010 nasa spacecraft make new discoveries about northern lights http www nasa gov mission pages themis auroras northern lights html retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title substorm oldid 763158706 categories planetary science geomagnetism earth hidden categories cs1 errors dates articles containing video clips navigation menu search this page was last edited on 1 february 2017 at 17 10 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
