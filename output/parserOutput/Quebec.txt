and hudson bay to the north by hudson strait and ungava bay to the east by the gulf of saint lawrence and the province of newfoundland and labrador and to the south by the province of new brunswick and the us states of maine new hampshire vermont and new york it also shares maritime borders with nunavut prince edward island and nova scotia quebec is canada s largest province by area and its second-largest administrative division only the territory of nunavut is larger it is historically and politically considered to be part of central canada with ontario quebec is the second-most populous province of canada after ontario 10 it is the only one to have a predominantly french-speaking population with french as the sole provincial official language most inhabitants live in urban areas near the saint lawrence river between montreal and quebec city the capital approximately half of quebec residents live in the greater montreal area including the island of montreal english-speaking communities and english-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of montreal but are also significantly present in the outaouais eastern townships and gasp regions the nord-du-qu bec region occupying the northern half of the province is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by aboriginal peoples 11 the climate around the major cities is four-season continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions 12 even in central quebec at comparatively southerly latitudes winters are severe in inland areas quebec independence debates have played a large role in the politics of the province parti qu b cois governments held referendums on sovereignty in 1980 and 1995 both were voted down by voters the latter defeated by a very narrow margin 13 in 2006 the house of commons of canada passed a symbolic motion recognizing the qu b cois as a nation within a united canada 14 15 while the province s substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy sectors of the knowledge economy such as aerospace information and communication technologies biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry also play leading roles these many industries have all contributed to helping quebec become an economically influential province within canada second only to ontario in economic output 16 contents 1 etymology and boundary changes 2 geography 2.1 hydrography 2.2

which comes from the algonquin word k bec meaning where the river narrows originally referred to the area around quebec city where the saint lawrence river narrows to a cliff-lined gap early variations in the spelling of the name included qu becq levasseur 1601 and k bec lescarbot 1609 17 french explorer samuel de champlain chose the name qu bec in 1608 for the colonial outpost he would use as the administrative seat for the french colony of new france 18 the province is sometimes referred to as la belle province the beautiful province the province of quebec was founded in the royal proclamation of 1763 after the treaty of paris formally transferred the french colony of canada 19 to britain after the seven years war the proclamation restricted the province to an area along the banks of the saint lawrence river the quebec act of 1774 expanded the territory of the province to include the great lakes and the ohio river valley and south of rupert s land more or less restoring the borders previously existing under french rule before the conquest 20 the treaty of versailles ceded territories south of the great lakes to the united states 21 after the constitutional act of 1791 the territory was divided between lower canada present-day quebec and upper canada present-day ontario with each being granted an elected legislative assembly 22 in 1840 these become canada east and canada west after the british parliament unified upper and lower canada into the province of canada 23 this territory was redivided into the provinces of quebec and ontario at confederation in 1867 24 each became one of the first four provinces in 1870 canada purchased rupert s land from the hudson s bay company and over the next few decades the parliament of canada transferred to quebec portions of this territory that would more than triple the size of the province 25 in 1898 the canadian parliament passed the first quebec boundary extension act that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the local aboriginal peoples 26 this was followed by the addition of the district of ungava through the quebec boundaries extension act of 1912 that added the northernmost lands of the inuit to create the modern province of quebec 26 in 1927 the border between quebec and newfoundland and labrador was established by the british judicial committee of the privy council quebec officially disputes this boundary 27 geography map of quebec located in the eastern part of canada and from a historical and political perspective part of central canada quebec occupies a territory nearly three times the size of france or texas most of which is very sparsely populated 28 its topography is very different from one region to another due to the varying composition of the ground the climate latitude and altitude and the proximity to water the saint lawrence lowland south and the canadian shield north are the two main topographic regions and are radically different 29 hydrography quebec has one of the world s largest reserves of fresh water 30 occupying 12 of its surface 31 it has 3 of the world s renewable fresh water whereas it has only 0.1 of its population 32 more than half a million lakes 30 including 30 with an area greater than 250 square kilometres 97 sq mi and 4,500 rivers 30 pour their torrents into the atlantic ocean through the gulf of saint lawrence and the arctic ocean by james hudson and ungava bays the largest inland body of water is the caniapiscau reservoir created in the realization of the james bay project to produce hydroelectric power lake mistassini is the largest natural lake in quebec 33 michel s falls on ashuapmushuan river in saint-f licien saguenay lac-saint-jean the saint lawrence river has some of the world s largest sustaining inland atlantic ports at montreal the province s largest city trois-rivi res and quebec city the capital its access to the atlantic ocean and the interior of north america made it the base of early french exploration and settlement in the 17th and 18th centuries since 1959 the saint lawrence seaway has provided a navigable link between the atlantic ocean and the great lakes northeast of quebec city the river broadens into the world s largest estuary the feeding site of numerous species of whales fish and seabirds 34 the river empties into the gulf of saint lawrence this marine environment sustains fisheries and smaller ports in the lower saint lawrence bas-saint-laurent lower north shore c te-nord and gasp gasp sie regions of the province the saint lawrence river with its estuary forms the basis of quebec s development through the centuries at the same time many affluent rivers testify to the exploration of land among them ashuapmushuan chaudi re gatineau manicouagan ottawa richelieu rupert saguenay saint-fran ois and saint-maurice topography jacques-cartier river quebec s highest point at 1,652 metres is mont d iberville known in english as mount caubvick located on the border with newfoundland and labrador in the northeastern part of the province in the torngat mountains 35 the most populous physiographic region is the saint lawrence lowland it extends northeastward from the southwestern portion of the province along the shores of the saint lawrence river to the quebec city region limited to the north by the laurentian mountains and to the south by the appalachians it mainly covers the areas of the centre-du-qu bec laval mont r gie and montreal the southern regions of the capitale-nationale lanaudi re laurentides mauricie and includes anticosti island the mingan archipelago 36 and other small islands of the gulf of st lawrence lowland forests ecoregion 37 its landscape is low-lying and flat except for isolated igneous outcrops near montreal called the monteregian hills formerly covered by the waters of lake champlain the oka hills also rise from the plain geologically the lowlands formed as a rift valley about 100 million years ago and are prone to infrequent but significant earthquakes 29 the most recent layers of sedimentary rock were formed as the seabed of the ancient champlain sea at the end of the last ice age about 14,000 years ago 38 the combination of rich and easily arable soils and quebec s relatively warm climate makes this valley the most prolific agricultural area of quebec province mixed forests provide most of canada s springtime maple syrup crop the rural part of the landscape is divided into narrow rectangular tracts of land that extend from the river and date back to settlement patterns in 17th century new france autumn landscape of haute-gasp sie more than 95 of quebec s territory lies within the canadian shield 39 it is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the laurentian mountains in southern quebec the otish mountains in central quebec and the torngat mountains near ungava bay the topography of the shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages which explains the glacial deposits of boulders gravel and sand and by sea water and post-glacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the shield the canadian shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes bogs streams and rivers it is rich in the forestry mineral and hydro-electric resources that are a mainstay of the quebec economy primary industries sustain small cities in regions of abitibi-t miscamingue saguenay lac-saint-jean and c te-nord mont tremblant resort laurentian mountains the labrador peninsula is covered by the laurentian plateau or canadian shield dotted with mountains such as otish mountains the ungava peninsula is notably composed of d youville mountains puvirnituq mountains and pingualuit crater while low and medium altitude peak from western quebec to the far north high altitudes mountains emerge in the capitale-nationale region to the extreme east along its longitude in the labrador peninsula portion of the shield the far northern region of nunavik includes the ungava peninsula and consists of flat arctic tundra inhabited mostly by the inuit further south lie the subarctic taiga of the eastern canadian shield taiga ecoregion and the boreal forest of the central canadian shield forests where spruce fir and poplar trees provide raw materials for quebec s pulp and paper and lumber industries although the area is inhabited principally by the cree naskapi and innu first nations thousands of temporary workers reside at radisson to service the massive james bay hydroelectric project on the la grande and eastmain rivers the southern portion of the shield extends to the laurentians a mountain range just north of the saint lawrence lowland that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts the appalachian region of quebec has a narrow strip of ancient mountains along the southeastern border of quebec the appalachians are actually a huge chain that extends from alabama to newfoundland in between it covers in quebec near 800 km 497 mi from the mont r gie hills to the gasp peninsula in western quebec the average altitude is about 500 metres while in the gasp peninsula the appalachian peaks especially the chic-choc are among the highest in quebec exceeding 1000 metres climate k ppen climate types of quebec quebec has three main climate regions southern and western quebec including most of the major population centres have a humid continental climate k ppen climate classification dfb with four distinct seasons having warm to occasionally hot and humid summers and often very cold and snowy winters 40 the main climatic influences are from western and northern canada and move eastward and from the southern and central united states that move northward because of the influence of both storm systems from the core of north america and the atlantic ocean precipitation is abundant throughout the year with most areas receiving more than 1,000 millimetres 39 in of precipitation including over 300 centimetres 120 in of snow in many areas 41 during the summer severe weather patterns such as tornadoes and severe thunderstorms occur occasionally 42 most of central quebec has a subarctic climate k ppen dfc winters are long very cold and snowy and among the coldest in eastern canada while summers are warm but very short due to the higher latitude and the greater influence of arctic air masses precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south except at some of the higher elevations the northern regions of quebec have an arctic climate k ppen et with very cold winters and short much cooler summers the primary influences in this region are the arctic ocean currents such as the labrador current and continental air masses from the high arctic baie-saint-paul during winter the four seasons in quebec are spring summer autumn and winter with conditions differing by region they are then differentiated according to the insolation temperature and precipitation of snow and rain 43 at quebec city the length of the daily sunshine varies from 8 37 hrs in december to 15 50 hrs in june the annual variation is much greater from 4 54 to 19 29 hrs at the northern tip of the province 44 from temperate zones to the northern territories of the far north the brightness varies with latitude as well as the northern lights and midnight sun quebec is divided into four climatic zones arctic subarctic humid continental and east maritime from south to north average temperatures range in summer between 25 and 5 c 77 and 41 f and in winter between 10 and 25 c 14 and 13 f 45 46 in periods of intense heat and cold temperatures can reach 35 c 95 f in the summer 47 and 40 c 40 f during the quebec winter 47 they may vary depending on the humidex or wind chill the all-time record of the greatest precipitation in winter was established in winter 2007 2008 with more than five metres 48 of snow in the area of quebec city while the average amount received per winter is around three metres 49 march 1971 however saw the century s snowstorm with more than 40 centimetres 16 in in montreal to 80 centimetres 31 in in mont apica of snow within 24 hours in many regions of southern quebec also the winter of 2010 was the warmest and driest recorded in more than 60 years 50 average daily

there are two particularly important to cite the walrus and the narwhal 53 snowy owl official bird of quebec inland waters are populated by small to large fresh water fish such as the largemouth bass the american pickerel the walleye the acipenser oxyrinchus the muskellunge the atlantic cod the arctic char the brook trout the microgadus tomcod tomcod the atlantic salmon the rainbow trout etc 54 among the birds commonly seen in the southern inhabited part of quebec there are the american robin the house sparrow the red-winged blackbird the mallard the common grackle the blue jay the american crow the black-capped chickadee some warblers and swallows the starling and the rock pigeon the latter two having been introduced in quebec and are found mainly in urban areas 55 avian fauna includes birds of prey like the golden eagle the peregrine falcon the snowy owl and the bald eagle sea and semi-aquatic birds seen in quebec are mostly the canada goose the double-crested cormorant the northern gannet the european herring gull the great blue heron the sandhill crane the atlantic puffin and the common loon 56 many more species of land maritime or avian wildlife are seen in quebec but most of the quebec-specific species and the most commonly seen species are listed above some livestock have the title of qu bec heritage breed namely the canadian horse the chantecler chicken and the canadian cow 57 moreover in addition to food certified as organic charlevoix lamb is the first local quebec product whose geographical indication is protected 58 livestock production also includes the pig breeds landrace duroc and yorkshire 59 and many breeds of sheep 60 and cattle the wildlife foundation of quebec and the data centre on natural heritage of quebec cdpnq french acronym 61 are the main agencies working with officers for wildlife conservation in quebec vegetation taiga forest in gasp qu bec canada given the geology of the province and its different climates there is an established number of large areas of vegetation in quebec these areas listed in order from the northernmost to the southernmost are the tundra the taiga the canadian boreal forest coniferous mixed forest and deciduous forest 39 on the edge of the ungava bay and hudson strait is the tundra whose flora is limited to a low vegetation of lichen with only less than 50 growing days a year the tundra vegetation survives an average annual temperature of 8 c 18 f the tundra covers more than 24 of the area of quebec 39 further south the climate is conducive to the growth of the canadian boreal forest bounded on the north by the taiga the different forest areas of quebec not as arid as the tundra the taiga is associated with the sub-arctic regions of the canadian shield 62 and is characterized by a greater number of both plant 600 and animal 206 species many of which live there all year the taiga covers about 20 of the total area of quebec 39 the canadian boreal forest is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in quebec that straddle the canadian shield and the upper lowlands of the province given a warmer climate the diversity of organisms is also higher since there are about 850 plant species and 280 vertebrates species the canadian boreal forest covers 27 of the area of quebec 39 the mixed forest is a transition zone between the canadian boreal forest and deciduous forest by virtue of its transient nature this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant 1000 and vertebrates 350 species despite relatively cool temperatures the ecozone mixed forest covers 11.5 of the area of quebec and is characteristic of the laurentians the appalachians and the eastern lowlands forests 62 the third most northern forest area is characterized by deciduous forests because of its climate average annual temperature of 7 c 45 f it is in this area that one finds the greatest diversity of species including more than 1600 vascular plants and 440 vertebrates its relatively long growing season lasts almost 200 days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanization of quebec most of quebec s population lives in this area of vegetation almost entirely along the banks of the st lawrence deciduous forests cover approximately 6.6 of the area of quebec 39 the total forest area of quebec is estimated at 750,300 square kilometres 289,700 sq mi 63 from the abitibi-t miscamingue to the north shore the forest is composed primarily of conifers such as the abies balsamea the jack pine the white spruce the black spruce and the tamarack some species of deciduous trees such as the yellow birch appear when the river is approached in the south the deciduous forest of the saint lawrence lowlands is mostly composed of deciduous species such as the sugar maple the red maple the white ash the american beech the butternut white walnut the american elm the basswood the bitternut hickory and the northern red oak as well as some conifers such as the eastern white pine and the northern whitecedar the distribution areas of the paper birch the trembling aspen and the mountain ash cover more than half of quebec territory 64 history indigenous peoples and european exploration glacial lakes agassiz and ojibway 7,900 bpe at the time of first european contact and later colonization algonquian iroquois and inuit nations controlled what is now quebec 65 their lifestyles and cultures reflected the land on which they lived algonquians organized into seven political entities lived nomadic lives based on hunting gathering and fishing in the rugged terrain of the canadian shield james bay cree innu algonquins and appalachian mountains mi kmaq abenaki 66 st lawrence iroquoians a branch of the iroquois lived more settled lives growing corn beans and squash in the fertile soils of the st lawrence valley they appear to have been later supplanted by the mohawk nation 67 the inuit continue to fish and hunt whale and seal in the harsh arctic climate along the coasts of hudson and ungava bay 68 these people traded fur and food and sometimes warred with each other new france a depiction of jacques cartier by th ophile hamel 1844 no contemporary likeness of cartier has been found to exist 69 around 1522 1523 the italian navigator giovanni da verrazzano persuaded king francis i of france to commission an expedition to find a western route to cathay china in 1534 breton explorer jacques cartier planted a cross in the gasp peninsula and claimed the land in the name of king francis i 70 it was the first province of new france however initial french attempts at settling the region met with failure 70 french fishing fleets however continued to sail to the atlantic coast and into the st lawrence river making alliances with first nations that would become important once france began to occupy the land 71 three huron-wyandot chiefs from wendake in quebec new france had largely peaceful relations with the indigenous people such as their allies the huron after the defeat of the huron by their mutual enemies the iroquois many fled from ontario to quebec samuel de champlain was part of a 1603 expedition from france that travelled into the st lawrence river 72 in 1608 he returned as head of an exploration party and founded quebec city with the intention of making the area part of the french colonial empire 73 74 75 champlain s habitation de qu bec built as a permanent fur trading outpost was where he would forge a trading and ultimately a military alliance with the algonquin and huron nations 76 first nations traded their furs for many french goods such as metal objects guns alcohol and clothing coureurs des bois voyageurs and catholic missionaries used river canoes to explore the interior of the north american continent 77 they establishing fur trading forts on the great lakes tienne br l 1615 hudson bay radisson and groseilliers 1659 60 ohio river and mississippi river la salle 1682 as well as the saskatchewan river and missouri river de la verendrye 1734 1738 78 after 1627 king louis xiii of france allowed the company of new france to introduced the seigneurial system and forbade settlement in new france by anyone other than roman catholics 79 in 1629 there was the surrender of quebec without battle to english privateers led by david kirke during the thirty years war however samuel de champlain argued that the english seizing of the lands was illegal as the war had already ended he worked to have the lands returned to france as part of the ongoing negotiations of their exit from the anglo-french war in 1632 the english king charles agreed to return the lands in exchange for louis xiii paying his wife s dowry these terms were signed into law with the treaty of saint-germain-en-laye the lands in quebec and acadia were returned to the french company of one hundred associates new france became a royal province in 1663 under king louis xiv of france with a sovereign council that included intendant jean talon 80 the population grew slowly under french rule 81 thus remained relatively low as growth was largely achieved through natural births rather than by immigration 82 to encourage population growth and to redress the severe imbalance between single men and women king louis xiv sponsored the passage of approximately 800 young french women known as les filles du roi to the colony most of the french were farmers canadiens or habitants and the rate of population growth among the settlers themselves was very high 83 seven years war and capitulation of new france authorities in new france became more aggressive in their efforts to expel british traders and colonists from the ohio valley they began construction of a series of fortifications to protect the area 84 in 1754 george washington launched a surprise attack on a group of canadien soldiers sleeping in the early morning hours it came at a time when no declaration of war had been issued by either country this frontier aggression known as the jumonville affair set the stage for the french and indian war a us designation in canada it is usually referred to as the seven years war although french canadians often call it la guerre de la conqu te the war of conquest 85 86 in north america by 1756 france and britain were battling the seven years war worldwide in 1758 the british mounted an attack on new france by sea and took the french fort at louisbourg on september 13 1759 the british forces of general james wolfe defeated those of french general louis-joseph de montcalm on the plains of abraham outside quebec city with the exception of the small islands of saint pierre and miquelon located off the coast of newfoundland france ceded its north american possessions to great britain through the treaty of paris 1763 in favour of gaining the island of guadeloupe for its then-lucrative sugar cane industry 87 the british royal proclamation of 1763 renamed canada part of new france as the province of quebec quebec act the province of quebec in 1774 with unrest growing in the colonies to the south which would one day grow into the american revolution the british were worried that the french-speaking canadians might also support the growing rebellion at that time french-speaking canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of quebec more than 99 and british immigration was not going well to secure the allegiance of the approximately 90,000 french-speaking canadians to the british crown first governor james murray and later governor guy carleton promoted the need for change there was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the french-speaking canadian subjects and those of newly arrived british subjects these efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the quebec act 88 of 1774 the quebec act provided the people of quebec their first charter of rights and paved the way to later official recognition of the french language and french culture the act also allowed canadiens to maintain french civil law and sanctioned freedom of religion allowing the roman catholic church to remain one of the first cases in history of state-sanctioned freedom of religious practice 89 effects of the american revolution although the quebec act was unrelated to the events in boston of 1773 and was not regarded as one of the coercive acts the timing of its passage led british colonists to the south to believe that it was part of the program to punish them the quebec act offended a variety of interest groups in the british colonies land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a non-representative government many feared the establishment of catholicism in quebec and that the french canadians were being courted to help oppress british americans 90 defending quebec from an american attack during the battle of quebec in december 1775 on june 27 1775 general george washington decided to attempt an invasion of canada by the american continental army to wrest quebec and the st lawrence river from the british the invasion failed when british reinforcements came down the st lawrence in may 1776 and the battle of trois-rivi res turned into a disaster for the americans the army withdrew to ticonderoga 91 although some help was given to the americans by the locals governor carleton punished american sympathizers and public support of the american cause came to an end in 1778 frederick haldimand took over for guy carleton as governor of quebec the arrival of 10,000 loyalists at quebec in 1784 destroyed the political balance that haldimand and carleton before him had worked so hard to achieve the swelling numbers of english encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government 92 to restore stability to his largest remaining north american colony king george iii sent carleton back to quebec to remedy the situation 93 in ten years quebec had undergone a dramatic change what worked for carleton in 1774 was not likely to succeed in 1784 specifically there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance there were simply too many english people unwilling to reach a compromise with the 145,000 canadiens or their colonial governor the situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving 93 separation of the province of quebec a plan of the inhabited part of the province of quebec c 1785 by james peachey peter winkworth collection library and archives canada e000756679 loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the british legal system they were used to in the american colonies the creation of upper and lower canada in 1791 allowed most loyalists to live under british laws and institutions while the french-speaking population of lower canada could maintain their familiar french civil law and the catholic religion 94 therefore governor haldimand at the suggestion of carleton drew loyalists away from quebec city and montreal by offering free land on the northern shore of lake ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to george iii the loyalists were thus given land grants of 200 acres 81 ha per person basically this approach was designed with the intent of keeping french and english as far apart as possible therefore after the separation of the province of quebec lower canada and upper canada were formed each with its own government 93 patriotes rebellion in lower canada the burning of the parliament buildings in montreal occurred on the night of april 25 1849 in 1837 residents of lower canada led by louis-joseph papineau and robert nelson formed an armed resistance group to seek an end to the unilateral control of the british governors 95 they made a declaration of rights with equality for all citizens without discrimination and a declaration of independence of lower-canada in 1838 96 their actions resulted in rebellions in both lower and upper canada an unprepared british army had to raise militia force the rebel forces scored a victory in saint-denis but were soon defeated after the rebellions lord durham was asked to undertake a study and prepare a report on the matter and to offer a solution for the british parliament to assess 97 following durham s report 97 the british government merged the two colonial provinces into one province of canada in 1840 with the act of union 98 the two colonies remained

automatically involved as a dominion about 6,000 volunteers from quebec participated on the european front although reaction to conscription was favourable in english canada the idea was deeply unpopular in quebec the conscription crisis of 1917 did much to highlight the divisions between french and english-speaking canadians in canada during world war ii the participation of quebec was more important but led to the conscription crisis of 1944 and opposition many quebecers fought against the axis power between 1939 to 1945 with the involvement of many francophone regiments such as les fusiliers mont-royal le r giment de la chaudi re and many more quiet revolution ad lard godbout implemented a program of progressive legislation that laid the groundwork for the quiet revolution the conservative government of maurice duplessis and his union nationale dominated quebec politics from 1944 to 1959 with the support of the catholic church 101 pierre trudeau and other liberals formed an intellectual opposition to duplessis s regime setting the groundwork for the quiet revolution under jean lesage s liberals the quiet revolution was a period of dramatic social and political change 102 that saw the decline of anglo supremacy in the quebec economy the decline of the roman catholic church s influence 13 the formation of hydroelectric companies under hydro-qu bec 102 and the emergence of a pro-sovereignty movement under former liberal minister ren l vesque october crisis beginning in 1963 a paramilitary group that became known as the front de lib ration du qu bec flq launched a decade-long series of propaganda and terrorism that included bombings robberies and attacks 103 directed primarily at english institutions resulting in at least five deaths in 1970 their activities culminated in events referred to as the october crisis when james cross the british trade commissioner to canada was kidnapped along with pierre laporte a provincial minister and vice-premier 104 laporte was strangled with his own rosary beads a few days later in their published manifesto the militants stated in the coming year bourassa will have to face reality 100,000 revolutionary workers armed and organized at the request of premier robert bourassa prime minister pierre trudeau invoked the war measures act parti qu b cois and national unity in 1977 the newly elected parti qu b cois government of ren l vesque introduced the charter of the french language often known as bill 101 it defined french as the only official language of quebec in areas of provincial jurisdiction 105 l vesque and his party had run in the 1970 and 1973 quebec elections under a platform of separating quebec from the rest of canada the party failed to win control of quebec s national assembly both times though its share of the vote increased from 23 percent to 30 percent and l vesque was defeated both times in the riding he contested 106 in the 1976 election he softened his message by promising a referendum plebiscite on sovereignty-association rather than outright separation by which quebec would have independence in most government functions but share some other ones such as a common currency with canada on november 15 1976 l vesque and the parti qu b cois won control of the provincial government for the first time the question of sovereignty-association was placed before the voters in the 1980 quebec referendum during the campaign pierre trudeau promised that a vote for the no side was a vote for reforming canada trudeau advocated the patriation of canada s constitution from the united kingdom the existing constitutional document the british north america act could only be amended by the united kingdom parliament upon a request by the canadian parliament ren l vesque in paul sauv arena montreal on the 1973 election night sixty percent of the quebec electorate voted against the proposition for sovereignty-association 107 polls showed that the overwhelming majority of english and immigrant quebecers voted against and that french quebecers were almost equally divided with older voters less in favour and younger voters more in favour after his loss in the referendum l vesque went back to ottawa to start negotiating a new constitution with trudeau his minister of justice jean chr tien and the nine other provincial premiers l vesque insisted quebec be able to veto any future constitutional amendments the negotiations quickly reached a stand-still quebec is the only province not to have assented to the patriation of the canadian constitution in 1982 108 in subsequent years two attempts were made to gain quebec s approval of the constitution the first was the meech lake accord of 1987 which was finally abandoned in 1990 when the province of manitoba did not pass it within the established deadline newfoundland premier clyde wells had expressed his opposition to the accord but with the failure in manitoba the vote for or against meech never took place in his province this led to the formation of the sovereigntist bloc qu b cois party in ottawa under the leadership of lucien bouchard 109 who had resigned from the federal cabinet the second attempt the charlottetown accord of 1992 also failed to gain traction this result caused a split in the quebec liberal party that led to the formation of the new action d mocratique democratic action party led by mario dumont and jean allaire the results of the 1995 quebec referendum per circonscription dark brown means high no dark blue means high yes on october 30 1995 with the parti qu b cois back in power since 1994 a second referendum on sovereignty took place this time it was rejected by a slim majority 50.6 percent no to 49.4 percent yes 110 statut particulier special status given the province s heritage and the preponderance of french unique among the canadian provinces there has been debate in canada regarding the unique status statut particulier of quebec and its people wholly or partially prior attempts to amend the canadian constitution to acknowledge quebec as a distinct society referring to the province s uniqueness within canada regarding law language and culture have been unsuccessful however the federal government under prime minister jean chr tien would later endorse recognition of quebec as a distinct society 111 on october 30 2003 the national assembly of quebec voted unanimously to affirm that the people of qu bec form a nation 112 on november 27 2006 the house of commons passed a symbolic motion moved by prime minister stephen harper
