also known as primordial isotopes are nuclides found on earth that have existed in their current form since before earth was formed primordial nuclides were present in the interstellar medium from which the solar system was formed and were formed in the big bang by nucleosynthesis in stars and supernovae followed by mass ejection by cosmic ray spallation and potentially from other processes they are the stable nuclides plus the long-lived fraction of radionuclides surviving in the primordial solar nebula through planet accretion until the present only 286 such nuclides are known all of the known 253 stable nuclides occur as primordial nuclides plus another 33 nuclides that have half-lives long enough to have survived from the formation of the earth these 33 primordial radionuclides represent isotopes of 28 separate elements cadmium tellurium neodymium samarium and uranium each have two primordial radioisotopes 113 cd 116 cd 128 te 130 te 144 nd 150 nd 147 sm 148 sm and 235 u 238 u because the age of the earth is 7017144533808000000 4.58 109 years 4.6 billion years this means that the half-life of the given nuclides must be greater than about 7015315576000000000 1 108 years 100 million years for practical considerations for example for a nuclide with half-life 7015189345600000000 6 107 years 60 million years this means 77 half-lives have elapsed meaning that for each mole 7023602000000000000 6.02 1023 atoms of that nuclide being present at the formation of earth only 4 atoms remain today the shortest-lived primordial nuclides i e nuclides with shortest half-lives are 232 th 238 u 40 k and 235 u these are the 4 nuclides with half-lives comparable to or less than the estimated age of the universe in the case of 232th it has a half life of more than 14 billion years slightly longer than the age of the universe for a complete list of the 33 known primordial radionuclides including the next 29 with half-lives much longer than the age of the universe see the complete list in the section below for practical purposes nuclides with half-lives much longer than the age of the universe may be treated as if they really were stable 232th and 238u have half-lives long enough that their decay is limited over geological time scales 40k and 235u have shorter half-lives and are hence severely depleted but are still long-lived enough to persist significantly in nature the next longest-living nuclide after the end of the list given in the table is 244 pu with a half-life of 7015254985408000000 8.08 107 years it has been reported to exist in nature as a primordial nuclide although later studies could not detect it 1 likewise the second-longest-lived non-primordial 146 sm with a half-life of 7015214591680000000 6.8 107 years was once reported as primordial but this could not be replicated 2 taking into account that all these nuclides must exist since at least 7017145164960000000 4.6 109 years meaning survive 57 half-lives their original number is now reduced by a factor of 257 which equals more than 1017 thus any remaining primordial 244pu and 146sm would only exist on earth in negligibly small quantities 3 although it is estimated that about 33 primordial nuclides are radioactive list below it becomes very difficult to determine the exact total number of radioactive primordials because the total number of stable nuclides is uncertain there exist many extremely long-lived nuclides whose half-lives are still unknown for example it is predicted theoretically that all isotopes of tungsten including those indicated by even the most modern empirical methods to be stable must be radioactive and can decay by alpha emission but as of 2013 this could only be measured experimentally for 180 w 4 similarly all four primordial isotopes of lead are expected to decay to mercury but the predicted half-lives are so long some exceeding 10100 years that this can hardly be observed in the near future nevertheless the number of nuclides with half-lives so long that they cannot be measured with present instruments and are considered from this viewpoint to be stable nuclides is limited even when a stable nuclide is found to be radioactive the fact merely moves it from the stable to the unstable list of primordial nuclides and the total number of primordial nuclides remains unchanged because primordial chemical elements often consist of more than one primordial isotope there are only 83 distinct primordial chemical elements of these 80 have at least one observationally stable isotope and three additional primordial elements have only radioactive isotopes bismuth thorium and uranium contents 1 naturally occurring nuclides that are not primordial 2 primordial elements 3 naturally occurring stable nuclides 4 list of 33 radioactive primordial nuclides and measured half-lives 4.1 list legends 5 see also 6 references naturally occurring nuclides that are not primordial edit some unstable isotopes which occur naturally such as 14 c 3 h and 239 pu are not primordial as they must be constantly regenerated this occurs by cosmic radiation in the case of cosmogenic nuclides such as 14 c and 3 h or rarely by such processes as geonuclear transmutation neutron capture of uranium in the case of 237 np and 239 pu other examples of common naturally occurring but non-primordial nuclides are isotopes of radon polonium and radium which are all radiogenic nuclide daughters of uranium decay and are found in uranium ores a similar radiogenic series is derived from the long-lived radioactive primordial nuclide 232th all of such nuclides have shorter half-lives than their parent radioactive primordial nuclides some other geogenic nuclides do not occur in the decay chains of 232th 235u or 238u but can still fleetingly occur naturally as products of the spontaneous fission of one of these three long-lived nuclides such as 126sn which makes up about 10 14 of all natural tin 5 primordial elements edit there are 253 stable primordial nuclides and 33 radioactive primordial nuclides but only 80 primordial stable elements 1 through 82 i e hydrogen through lead exclusive of 43 and 61 technetium and promethium respectively and three radioactive primordial elements bismuth thorium and uranium bismuth s half-life is so long that it is often classed with the 80 primordial stable elements instead since its radioactivity is not a cause for serious concern the numbers of elements are smaller because many primordial elements are represented by more than one primordial nuclide see chemical element for more information naturally occurring stable nuclides edit as noted these number about 253 for a list see the article list of elements by stability of isotopes for a complete list noting which of the stable 253 nuclides may be in some respect unstable see list of nuclides and stable nuclide these questions do not impact the question of whether a nuclide is primordial since all nearly stable nuclides with half-lives longer than the age of the universe are primordial also list of 33 radioactive primordial nuclides and measured half-lives edit these 33 primordial nuclides represent radioisotopes of 28 distinct chemical elements cadmium neodymium samarium tellurium and uranium each have two primordial radioisotopes the radionuclides are listed in order of stability with the longest half-life beginning the list these radionuclides in many cases are so nearly stable that they compete for abundance with stable isotopes of their respective elements for three chemical elements a very long lived radioactive primordial nuclide is found to be the most abundant nuclide for an element that also has a stable nuclide these unusual elements are tellurium indium and rhenium the longest has a half-life of 7031694267200000000 2.2 1024 years which is 160 trillion times the age of the universe the latter is about 7017432000000000000 4.32 1017 s only four of these 33 nuclides have half-lives shorter than or equal to the age of the universe most of the remaining 29 have half-lives much longer the shortest-lived primordial isotope 235u has a half-life of 704 million years about one sixth of
