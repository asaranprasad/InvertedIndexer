the sun and the second-smallest planet in the solar system after mercury in english mars carries a name of the roman god of war and is often referred to as the red planet 14 15 because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye 16 mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the moon and the valleys deserts and polar ice caps of earth the rotational period and seasonal cycles of mars are likewise similar to those of earth as is the tilt that produces the seasons mars is the site of olympus mons the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the solar system and of valles marineris one of the largest canyons in the solar system the smooth borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40 of the planet and may be a giant impact feature 17 18 mars has two moons phobos and deimos which are small and irregularly shaped these may be captured asteroids 19 20 similar to 5261 eureka a mars trojan there are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of mars as well as the possibility of extant life future astrobiology missions are planned including the mars 2020 and exomars rovers 21 22 23 24 liquid water cannot exist on the surface of mars due to low atmospheric pressure which is less than 1 of the earth s 25 except at the lowest elevations for short periods 26 27 the two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water 28 29 the volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap if melted would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of 11 meters 36 ft 30 in november 2016 nasa reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the utopia planitia region of mars the volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in lake superior 31 32 33 mars can easily be seen from earth with the naked eye as can its reddish coloring its apparent magnitude reaches 2.91 8 which is surpassed only by jupiter venus the moon and the sun optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving

dense than earth having about 15 of earth s volume and 11 of earth s mass resulting in about 38 of earth s surface gravity the red-orange appearance of the martian surface is caused by iron iii oxide or rust 35 it can look like butterscotch 36 other common surface colors include golden brown tan and greenish depending on the minerals present 36 comparison earth and mars play media animation 00 40 showing major features of mars play media video 01 28 showing how three nasa orbiters mapped the gravity field of mars internal structure like earth mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials 37 current models of its interior imply a core with a radius of about 1,794 65 kilometers 1,115 40 mi consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16 17 sulfur 38 this iron ii sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in lighter elements as earth s 39 the core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet but it appears to be dormant besides silicon and oxygen the most abundant elements in the martian crust are iron magnesium aluminum calcium and potassium the average thickness of the planet s crust is about 50 km 31 mi with a maximum thickness of 125 km 78 mi 39 earth s crust averages 40 km 25 mi surface geology mars is a terrestrial planet that consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen metals and other elements that typically make up rock the surface of mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt 40 although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on earth or silica glass regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found 41 much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron iii oxide dust 42 43 geologic map of mars usgs 2014 44 although mars has no evidence of a structured global magnetic field 45 observations show that parts of the planet s crust have been magnetized suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past this paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on earth s ocean floors one theory published in 1999 and re-examined in october 2005 with the help of the mars global surveyor is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on mars four billion years ago before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet s magnetic field faded 46 it is thought that during the solar system s formation mars was created as the result of a stochastic process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the sun mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the solar system elements with comparatively low boiling points such as chlorine phosphorus and sulphur are much more common on mars than earth these elements were probably pushed outward by the young sun s energetic solar wind 47 after the formation of the planets all were subjected to the so-called late heavy bombardment about 60 of the surface of mars shows a record of impacts from that era 48 49 50 whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused by those events there is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the northern hemisphere of mars spanning 10,600 by 8,500 km 6,600 by 5,300 mi or roughly four times the size of the moon s south pole aitken basin the largest impact basin yet discovered 17 18 this theory suggests that mars was struck by a pluto-sized body about four billion years ago the event thought to be the cause of the martian hemispheric dichotomy created the smooth borealis basin that covers 40 of the planet 51 52 artist s impression of how mars may have looked four billion years ago 53 the geological history of mars can be split into many periods but the following are the three primary periods 54 55 noachian period named after noachis terra formation of the oldest extant surfaces of mars 4.5 to 3.5 billion years ago noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters the tharsis bulge a volcanic upland is thought to have formed during this period with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period hesperian period named after hesperia planum 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago the hesperian period is marked by the formation of extensive lava plains amazonian period named after amazonis planitia between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago to the present amazonian regions have few meteorite impact craters but are otherwise quite varied olympus mons formed during this period with lava flows elsewhere on mars geological activity is still taking place on mars the athabasca valles is home to sheet-like lava flows created about 200 mya water flows in the grabens called the cerberus fossae occurred less than 20 mya indicating equally recent volcanic intrusions 56 on february 19 2008 images from the mars reconnaissance orbiter showed evidence of an avalanche from a 700-metre-high 2,300 ft cliff 57 soil exposure of silica-rich dust uncovered by the spirit rover the phoenix lander returned data showing martian soil to be slightly alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium sodium potassium and chlorine these nutrients are found in soils on earth and they are necessary for growth of plants 58 experiments performed by the lander showed that the martian soil has a basic ph of 7.7 and contains 0.6 of the salt perchlorate 59 60 61 62 streaks are common across mars and new ones appear frequently on steep slopes of craters troughs and valleys the streaks are dark at first and get lighter with age the streaks can start in a tiny area then spread out for hundreds of metres they have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path the commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils 63 several other explanations have been put forward including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms 64 65 hydrology liquid water cannot exist on the surface of mars due to low atmospheric pressure which is less than 1 that of earth s 25 except at the lowest elevations for short periods 26 27 the two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water 28 29 the volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap if melted would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of 11 meters 36 ft 30 a permafrost mantle stretches from the pole to latitudes of about 60 28 large quantities of water ice are thought to be trapped within the thick cryosphere of mars radar data from mars express and the mars reconnaissance orbiter show large quantities of water ice at both poles july 2005 66 67 and at middle latitudes november 2008 68 the phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow martian soil on july 31 2008 69 photomicrograph by opportunity showing a gray hematite concretion nicknamed blueberries indicative of the past existence of liquid water landforms visible on mars strongly suggest that liquid water has existed on the planet s surface huge linear swathes of scoured ground known as outflow channels cut across the surface in about 25 places these are thought to be a record of erosion caused by the catastrophic release of water from subsurface aquifers though some of these structures have been hypothesized to result from the action of glaciers or lava 70 71 one of the larger examples ma adim vallis is 700 km 430 mi long much greater than the grand canyon with a width of 20 km 12 mi and a depth of 2 km 1.2 mi in places it is thought to have been carved by flowing water early in mars s history 72 the youngest of these channels are thought to have formed as recently as only a few million years ago 73 elsewhere particularly on the oldest areas of the martian surface finer-scale dendritic networks of valleys are spread across significant proportions of the landscape features of these valleys and their distribution strongly imply that they were carved by runoff resulting from precipitation in early mars history subsurface water flow and groundwater sapping may play important subsidiary roles in some networks but precipitation was probably the root cause of the incision in almost all cases 74 along crater and canyon walls there are thousands of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies the gullies tend to be in the highlands of the southern hemisphere and to face the equator all are poleward of 30 latitude a number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water probably from melting ice 75 76 although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust 77 78 no partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed indicating that these are young features possibly still active 76 other geological features such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters are further evidence for warmer wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier mars history 79 such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across a large proportion of the surface for which there is independent mineralogical sedimentological and geomorphological evidence 80 composition of yellowknife bay rocks rock veins are higher in calcium and sulfur than portage soil curiosity apxs 2013 further evidence that liquid water once existed on the surface of mars comes from the detection of specific minerals such as hematite and goethite both of which sometimes form in the presence of water 81 in 2004 opportunity detected the mineral jarosite this forms only in the presence of acidic water which demonstrates that water once existed on mars 82 more recent evidence for liquid water comes from the finding of the mineral gypsum on the surface by nasa s mars rover opportunity in december 2011 83 84 it is believed that the amount of water in the upper mantle of mars represented by hydroxyl ions contained within the minerals of mars s geology is equal to or greater than that of earth at 50 300 parts per million of water which is enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of 200 1,000 m 660 3,280 ft 85 in 2005 radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles 66 and at mid-latitudes 68 86 the mars rover spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in march 2007 the phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow martian soil on july 31 2008 69 on march 18 2013 nasa reported evidence from instruments on the curiosity rover of mineral hydration likely hydrated calcium sulfate in several rock samples including the broken fragments of tintina rock and sutton inlier rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like knorr rock and wernicke rock 87 88 89 analysis using the rover s dan instrument provided evidence of subsurface water amounting to as much as 4 water content down to a depth of 60 cm 24 in during the rover s traverse from the bradbury landing site to the yellowknife bay area in the glenelg terrain 87 in september 2015 nasa announced that they had found conclusive evidence of hydrated brine flows on recurring slope lineae based on spectrometer readings of the darkened areas of slopes 90 91 92 these observations provided confirmation of earlier hypotheses based on timing of formation and their rate of growth that these dark streaks resulted from water flowing in the very shallow subsurface 93 the streaks contain hydrated salts perchlorates which have water molecules in their crystal structure 94 the streaks flow downhill in martian summer when the temperature is above 23 degrees celsius and freeze at lower temperatures 95 on september 28 2015 nasa announced the presence of briny flowing salt water on the martian surface 96 researchers believe that much of the low northern plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep though this remains controversial 97 in march 2015 scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of earth s arctic ocean this finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on earth the amount of martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on earth suggesting that ancient mars had significantly higher levels of water results from the curiosity rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in gale crater though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed and point out that martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water 98 polar caps north polar early summer ice cap 1999 south polar midsummer ice cap 2000 mars has two permanent polar ice caps during a pole s winter it lies in continuous darkness chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25 30 of the atmosphere into slabs of co2 ice dry ice 99 when the poles are again exposed to sunlight the frozen co2 sublimes these seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor giving rise to earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds clouds of water-ice were photographed by the opportunity rover in 2004 100 the caps at both poles consist primarily 70 of water ice frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only whereas the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick this permanent dry ice cover at the south pole is peppered by flat floored shallow roughly circular pits which repeat imaging shows are expanding by meters per year this suggests that the permanent co2 cover over the south pole water ice is degrading over time 101 the northern polar cap has a diameter of about 1,000 km 620 mi during the northern mars summer 102 and contains about 1.6 million cubic kilometres 380,000 cu mi of ice which if spread evenly on the cap would be 2 km 1.2 mi thick 103 this compares to a volume of 2.85 million cubic kilometres 680,000 cu mi for the greenland ice sheet the southern polar cap has a diameter of 350 km 220 mi and a thickness of 3 km 1.9 mi 104 the total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has been estimated at 1.6 million cubic km 105 both polar caps show spiral troughs which recent analysis of sharad ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of katabatic winds that spiral due to the coriolis effect 106 107 the seasonal frosting of areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground with the arrival of spring sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming co2 builds up under a slab elevating and ultimately rupturing it this leads to geyser-like eruptions of co2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust this process is rapid observed happening in the space of a few days weeks or months a rate of change rather unusual in geology especially for mars the gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole 108 109 110 111 geography and naming of surface features a mola-based topographic map showing highlands red and orange dominating the southern hemisphere of mars lowlands blue the northern volcanic plateaus delimit regions of the northern plains whereas the highlands are punctuated by several large impact basins these new impact craters on mars occurred sometime between 2008 and 2014 as detected from orbit although better remembered for mapping the moon johann heinrich m dler and wilhelm beer were the first areographers they began by establishing that most of mars s surface features were permanent and by more precisely determining the planet s rotation period in 1840 m dler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of mars rather than giving names to the various markings beer and m dler simply designated them with letters meridian bay sinus meridiani was thus feature a 112 today features on mars are named from a variety of sources albedo features are named for classical mythology craters larger than 60 km are named for deceased scientists and writers and others who have contributed to the study of mars craters smaller than 60 km are named for towns and villages of the world with populations of less than 100,000 large valleys are named for the word mars or star in various languages small valleys are named for rivers 113 large albedo features retain many of the older names but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features for example nix olympica the snows of olympus has become olympus mons mount olympus 114 the surface of mars as seen from earth is divided into two kinds of areas with differing albedo the paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as martian continents and given names like arabia terra land of arabia or amazonis planitia amazonian plain the dark features were thought to be seas hence their names mare erythraeum mare sirenum and aurorae sinus the largest dark feature seen from earth is syrtis major planum 115 the permanent northern polar ice cap is named planum boreum whereas the southern cap is called planum australe mars s equator is defined by its rotation but the location of its prime meridian was specified as was earth s at greenwich by choice of an arbitrary point m dler and beer selected a line for their first maps of mars in 1830 after the spacecraft mariner 9 provided extensive imagery of mars in 1972 a small crater later called airy-0 located in the sinus meridiani middle bay or meridian bay was chosen for the definition of 0.0 longitude to coincide with the original selection 116 because mars has no oceans and hence no sea level a zero-elevation surface had to be selected as a reference level this is called the areoid 117 of mars analogous to the terrestrial geoid zero altitude was defined by the height at which there is 610.5 pa 6.105 mbar of atmospheric pressure 118 this pressure corresponds to the triple point of water and it is about 0.6 of the sea level surface pressure on earth 0.006 atm 119 in practice today this surface is defined directly from satellite gravity measurements map of quadrangles for mapping purposes the united states geological survey divides the surface of mars into thirty quadrangles each named for a prominent physiographic feature within that quadrangle 120 121 the quadrangles can be seen and explored via the interactive image map below mc-01 mare boreum mc-02 diacria mc-03 arcadia mc-04 mare acidalium mc-05 ismenius lacus mc-06 casius mc-07 cebrenia mc-08 amazonis mc-09 tharsis

top is at the far left on the equator the map images were taken by the mars global surveyor view talk impact topography bonneville crater and spirit rover s lander the dichotomy of martian topography is striking northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands pitted and cratered by ancient impacts research in 2008 has presented evidence regarding a theory proposed in 1980 postulating that four billion years ago the northern hemisphere of mars was struck by an object one-tenth to two-thirds the size of earth s moon if validated this would make the northern hemisphere of mars the site of an impact crater 10,600 by 8,500 km 6,600 by 5,300 mi in size or roughly the area of europe asia and australia combined surpassing the south pole aitken basin as the largest impact crater in the solar system 17 18 fresh asteroid impact on mars at these before and after images of the same site were taken on the martian afternoons of march 27 and 28 2012 respectively mro 124 mars is scarred by a number of impact craters a total of 43,000 craters with a diameter of 5 km 3.1 mi or greater have been found 125 the largest confirmed of these is the hellas impact basin a light albedo feature clearly visible from earth 126 due to the smaller mass of mars the probability of an object colliding with the planet is about half that of earth mars is located closer to the asteroid belt so it has an increased chance of being struck by materials from that source mars is more likely to be struck by short-period comets i e those that lie within the orbit of jupiter 127 in spite of this there are far fewer craters on mars compared with the moon because the atmosphere of mars provides protection against small meteors and surface modifying processes have erased some craters martian craters can have a morphology that suggests the ground became wet after the meteor impacted 128 volcanoes viking 1 image of olympus mons the volcano and related terrain are approximately 550 km 340 mi across the shield volcano olympus mons mount olympus is an extinct volcano in the vast upland region tharsis which contains several other large volcanoes olympus mons is roughly three times the height of mount everest which in comparison stands at just over 8.8 km 5.5 mi 129 it is either the tallest or second-tallest mountain in the solar system depending on how it is measured with various sources giving figures ranging from about 21 to 27 km 13 to 17 mi high 130 131 tectonic sites valles marineris 2001 mars odyssey the large canyon valles marineris latin for mariner valleys also known as agathadaemon in the old canal maps has a length of 4,000 km 2,500 mi and a depth of up to 7 km 4.3 mi the length of valles marineris is equivalent to the length of europe and extends across one-fifth the circumference of mars by comparison the grand canyon on earth is only 446 km 277 mi long and nearly 2 km 1.2 mi deep valles marineris was formed due to the swelling of the tharsis area which caused the crust in the area of valles marineris to collapse in 2012 it was proposed that valles marineris is not just a graben but a plate boundary where 150 km 93 mi of transverse motion has occurred making mars a planet with possibly a two-tectonic plate arrangement 132 133 holes images from the thermal emission imaging system themis aboard nasa s mars odyssey orbiter have revealed seven possible cave entrances on the flanks of the volcano arsia mons 134 the caves named after loved ones of their discoverers are collectively known as the seven sisters 135 cave entrances measure from 100 to 252 m 328 to 827 ft wide and they are estimated to be at least 73 to 96 m 240 to 315 ft deep because light does not reach the floor of most of the caves it is possible that they extend much deeper than these lower estimates and widen below the surface dena is the only exception its floor is visible and was measured to be 130 m 430 ft deep the interiors of these caverns may be protected from micrometeoroids uv radiation solar flares and high energy particles that bombard the planet s surface 136 atmosphere the tenuous atmosphere of mars visible on the horizon mars lost its magnetosphere 4 billion years ago 137 possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes 138 so the solar wind interacts directly with the martian ionosphere lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer both mars global surveyor and mars express have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind mars 137 139 and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the maven orbiter compared to earth the atmosphere of mars is quite rarefied atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges from a low of 30 pa 0.030 kpa on olympus mons to over 1,155 pa 1.155 kpa in hellas planitia with a mean pressure at the surface level of 600 pa 0.60 kpa 140 the highest atmospheric density on mars is equal to that found 35 km 22 mi 141 above earth s surface the resulting mean surface pressure is only 0.6 of that of earth 101.3 kpa the scale height of the atmosphere is about 10.8 km 6.7 mi 142 which is higher than earth s 6 km 3.7 mi because the surface gravity of mars is only about 38 of earth s an effect offset by both the lower temperature and 50 higher average molecular weight of the atmosphere of mars the atmosphere of mars consists of about 96 carbon dioxide 1.93 argon and 1.89 nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water 8 143 the atmosphere is quite dusty containing particulates about 1.5 m in diameter which give the martian sky a tawny color when seen from the surface 144 it may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles suspended in it 15 potential sources and sinks of methane ch 4 on mars methane has been detected in the martian atmosphere with a concentration of about 30 ppb 145 146 it occurs in extended plumes and the profiles imply that the methane was released from discrete regions in northern midsummer the principal plume contained 19,000 metric tons of methane with an estimated source strength of 0.6 kilograms per second 147 148 the profiles suggest that there may be two local source regions the first centered near and the second near 147 it is estimated that mars must produce 270 tonnes per year of methane 147 149 methane can exist in the martian atmosphere for only a limited period before it is destroyed estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6 4 years 147 150 its presence despite this short lifetime indicates that an active source of the gas must be present volcanic activity cometary impacts and the presence of methanogenic microbial life forms are among possible sources methane could be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization c involving water carbon dioxide and the mineral olivine which is known to be common on mars 151 escaping atmosphere on mars carbon oxygen and hydrogen by maven in uv 152 the curiosity rover which landed on mars in august 2012 is able to make measurements that distinguish between different isotopologues of methane 153 but even if the mission is to determine that microscopic martian life is the source of the methane the life forms likely reside far below the surface outside of the rover s reach 154 the first measurements with the tunable laser spectrometer tls indicated that there is less than 5 ppb of methane at the landing site at the point of the measurement 155 156 157 158 on september 19 2013 nasa scientists from further measurements by curiosity reported no detection of atmospheric methane with a measured value of 6999180000000000000 0.18 0.67 ppbv corresponding to an upper limit of only 1.3 ppbv 95 confidence limit and as a result conclude that the probability of current methanogenic microbial activity on mars is reduced 159 160 161 the mars orbiter mission by india is searching for methane in the atmosphere 162 while the exomars trace gas orbiter launched in 2016 would further study the methane as well as its decomposition products such as formaldehyde and methanol 163 on december 16 2014 nasa reported the curiosity rover detected a tenfold spike likely localized in the amount of methane in the martian atmosphere sample measurements taken a dozen times over 20 months showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014 averaging 7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere before and after that readings averaged around one-tenth that level 164 165 ammonia was tentatively detected on mars by the mars express satellite but with its relatively short lifetime it is not clear what produced it 166 ammonia is not stable in the martian atmosphere and breaks down after a few hours one possible source is volcanic activity 166 in september 2017 nasa reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet mars were temporarily doubled and were associated with an aurora 25 times brighter than any observed earlier due to a massive and unexpected solar storm in the middle of the month 167 aurora in 1994 the european space agency s mars express found an ultraviolet glow coming from magnetic umbrellas in the southern hemisphere mars does not have a global magnetic field which guides charged particles entering the atmosphere mars has multiple umbrella-shaped magnetic fields mainly in the southern hemisphere which are remnants of a global field that decayed billions of years ago in late december 2014 nasa s maven spacecraft detected evidence of widespread auroras in mars s northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20 30 degrees north latitude of mars s equator the particles causing the aurora penetrated into the martian atmosphere creating auroras below 100 km above the surface earth s auroras range from 100 km to 500 km above the surface magnetic fields in the solar wind drape over mars into the atmosphere and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas 168 on march 18 2015 nasa reported the detection of an aurora that is not fully understood and an unexplained dust cloud in the atmosphere of mars 169 climate dust storm on mars november 18 2012 november 25 2012 opportunity and curiosity rovers are noted of all the planets in the solar system the seasons of mars are the most earth-like due to the similar tilts of the two planets rotational axes the lengths of the martian seasons are about twice those of earth s because mars s greater distance from the sun leads to the martian year being about two earth years long martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about 143 c 225 f at the winter polar caps 11 to highs of up to 35 c 95 f in equatorial summer 12 the wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat the low atmospheric pressure and the low thermal inertia of martian soil 170 the planet is 1.52 times as far from the sun as earth resulting in just 43 of the amount of sunlight 171 if mars had an earth-like orbit its seasons would be similar to earth s because its axial tilt is similar to earth s the comparatively large eccentricity of the martian orbit has a significant effect mars is near perihelion when it is summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the north and near aphelion when it is winter in the southern hemisphere and summer in the north as a result the seasons in the southern hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case the summer temperatures in the south can be warmer than the equivalent summer temperatures in the north by up to 30 c 54 f 172 mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system reaching speeds of over 160 km h 100 mph these can vary from a storm over a small area to gigantic storms that cover the entire planet they tend to occur when mars is closest to the sun and have been shown to increase the global temperature 173 orbit and rotation mars is about 230 million kilometres 143,000,000 mi from the sun its orbital period is 687 earth days depicted in red earth s orbit is in blue mars s average distance from the sun is roughly 230 million kilometres 143,000,000 mi and its orbital period is 687 earth days the solar day or sol on mars is only slightly longer than an earth day 24 hours 39 minutes and 35.244 seconds 174 a martian year is equal to 1.8809 earth years or 1 year 320 days and 18.2 hours 8 the axial tilt of mars is 25.19 degrees relative to its orbital plane which is similar to the axial tilt of earth 8 as a result mars has seasons like earth though on mars they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer in the present day epoch the orientation of the north pole of mars is close to the star deneb 13 mars passed an aphelion in march 2010 175 and its perihelion in march 2011 176 the next aphelion came in february 2012 176 and the next perihelion came in january 2013 176 mars has a relatively pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.09 of the seven other planets in the solar system only mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity it is known that in the past mars has had a much more circular orbit at one point 1.35 million earth years ago mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002 much less than that of earth today 177 mars s cycle of eccentricity is 96,000 earth years compared to earth s cycle of 100,000 years 178 mars has a much longer cycle of eccentricity with a period of 2.2 million earth years and this overshadows the 96,000-year cycle in the eccentricity graphs for the last 35,000 years the orbit of mars has been getting slightly more eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the other planets the closest distance between earth and mars will continue to mildly decrease for the next 25,000 years 179 habitability and search for life search for life viking 1 lander s sampling arm scooped up soil samples for tests chryse planitia the current understanding of planetary habitability the ability of a world to develop environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life favors planets that have liquid water on their surface most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone which for the sun extends from just beyond venus to about the semi-major axis of mars 180 during perihelion mars dips inside this region but mars s thin low-pressure atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods the past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet s potential for habitability recent evidence has suggested that any water on the martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life 181 detection of impact glass deposits green spots at alga crater a possible site for preserved ancient life 182 this image from gale crater in 2018 prompted speculation that some shapes were worm-like fossils but they were geological formations probably formed under water 183 the lack of a magnetosphere and the extremely thin atmosphere of mars are a challenge the planet has little heat transfer across its surface poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form water instead sublimes to a gaseous state mars is nearly or perhaps totally geologically dead the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet 184 in situ investigations have been performed on mars by the viking landers spirit and opportunity rovers phoenix lander and curiosity rover evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown the viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results including a temporary increase of co 2 production on exposure to water and nutrients this sign of life was later disputed by scientists resulting in a continuing debate with nasa scientist gilbert levin asserting that viking may have found life a re-analysis of the viking data in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life has suggested that the viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life the tests could even have killed a hypothetical life form 185 tests conducted by the phoenix mars lander have shown that the soil has a alkaline ph and it contains magnesium sodium potassium and chloride 186 the soil nutrients may be able to support life but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light 187 a recent analysis of martian meteorite eeta79001 found 0.6 ppm clo 4 1.4 ppm clo 3 and 16 ppm no 3 most likely of martian origin the clo 3 suggests the presence of other highly oxidizing oxychlorines such as clo 2 or clo produced both by uv oxidation of cl and x-ray radiolysis of clo 4 thus only highly refractory and or well-protected sub-surface organics or life forms are likely to survive 188 a 2014 analysis of the phoenix wcl showed that the ca clo 4 2 in the phoenix soil has not interacted with liquid water of any form perhaps for as long as 600 myr if it had the highly soluble ca clo 4 2 in contact with liquid water would have formed only caso 4 this suggests a severely arid environment with minimal or no liquid water interaction 189 scientists have proposed that carbonate globules found in meteorite alh84001 which is thought to have originated from mars could be fossilized microbes extant on mars when the meteorite was blasted from the martian surface by a meteor strike some 15 million years ago this proposal has been met with skepticism and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed 190 small quantities of methane and formaldehyde detected by mars orbiters are both claimed to be possible evidence for life as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the martian atmosphere 191 192 alternatively these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means such as serpentinization 151 impact glass formed by the impact of meteors which on earth can preserve signs of life has been found on the surface of the impact craters on mars 193 194 likewise the glass in impact craters on mars could have preserved signs of life if life existed at the site 195 196 197 in may 2017 evidence of the earliest known life on land on earth may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits often found around hot springs and geysers uncovered in the pilbara craton of western australia these findings may be helpful in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet mars 198 199 in early 2018 media reports speculated that certain rock features at a site called jura looked like a type of fossil but project scientists say the formations likely resulted from a geological process at the bottom of an ancient drying lakebed and are related to mineral veins in the area similar to gypsum crystals 183 moons enhanced-color hirise image of phobos showing a series of mostly parallel grooves and crater chains with stickney crater at right enhanced-color hirise image of deimos not to scale showing its smooth blanket of regolith mars has two relatively small compared to earth s natural moons phobos about 22 km 14 mi in diameter and deimos about 12 km 7.5 mi in diameter which orbit close to the planet asteroid capture is a long-favored theory but their origin remains uncertain 200 both satellites were discovered in 1877 by asaph hall they are named after the characters phobos panic fear and deimos terror dread who in greek mythology accompanied their father ares god of war into battle mars was the roman counterpart of ares 201 202 in modern greek though the planet retains its ancient name ares aris 203 from the surface of mars the motions of phobos and deimos appear different from that of the moon phobos rises in the west sets in the east and rises again in just 11 hours deimos being only just outside synchronous orbit where the orbital period would match the planet s period of rotation rises as expected in the east but slowly despite the 30-hour orbit of deimos 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer as it slowly falls behind the rotation of mars 204 orbits of phobos and deimos to scale because the orbit of phobos is below synchronous altitude the tidal forces from the planet mars are gradually lowering its orbit in about 50 million years it could either crash into mars s surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet 204 the origin of the two moons is not well understood their low albedo and carbonaceous chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids supporting the capture theory the unstable orbit of phobos would seem to point towards a relatively recent capture but both have circular orbits near the equator which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex accretion early in the history of mars is plausible but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than mars itself if that is confirmed a third possibility is the involvement of a third body or a type of impact disruption 205 more-recent lines of evidence for phobos having a highly porous interior 206 and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from mars 207 point toward an origin of phobos from material ejected by an impact on mars that reaccreted in martian orbit 208 similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of earth s moon although the vnir spectra of the moons of mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids the thermal infrared spectra of phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class 207 mars may have moons smaller than 50 to 100 metres 160 to 330 ft in diameter and a dust ring is predicted to exist between phobos and deimos 20 exploration

space research organisation reached mars orbit isro launched mom on november 5 2013 with the aim of analyzing the martian atmosphere and topography the mars orbiter mission used a hohmann transfer orbit to escape earth s gravitational influence and catapult into a nine-month-long voyage to mars the mission is the first successful asian interplanetary mission 214 the european space agency in collaboration with roscosmos launched the exomars trace gas orbiter and schiaparelli lander on march 14 2016 215 while the trace gas orbiter successfully entered mars orbit on october 19 2016 schiaparelli crashed during its landing attempt 216 future concept for a bimodal nuclear thermal transfer vehicle in low earth orbit planned for may 2018 is the launch of nasa s insight lander along

launch in 2020 reaching mars orbit in 2021 the probe will make a global study of the martian atmosphere 220 several plans for a human mission to mars have been proposed throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century but no active plan has an arrival date sooner than the 2020s spacex founder elon musk presented a plan in september 2016 to optimistically launch space tourists to mars in 2024 at an estimated development cost of us 10 billion 221 in october 2016 president barack obama renewed u s policy to pursue the goal of sending humans to mars in the 2030s and to continue using the international space station as a technology incubator in that pursuit 222 223 the nasa authorization act of 2017 directed nasa to get humans near or on the surface of mars by the early 2030s 224 astronomy on mars with the presence of various orbiters landers and rovers it is possible to practice astronomy from mars although mars s moon phobos appears about one-third the angular diameter of the full moon on earth deimos appears more or less star-like looking only slightly brighter than venus does from earth 225 various phenomena seen from earth have also been observed from mars such as meteors and auroras 226 the apparent sizes of the moons phobos and deimos are sufficiently smaller than that of the sun thus their partial eclipses of the sun are best considered transits see transit of deimos and phobos from mars 227 228 transits of mercury and venus have been observed from mars a transit of earth will be seen from mars on november 10 2084 229 on october 19 2014 comet siding

10 2004 tracking sunspots from mars viewing animation of the apparent retrograde motion of mars in 2003 as seen from earth because the orbit of mars is eccentric its apparent magnitude at opposition from the sun can range from 3.0 to 1.4 the minimum brightness is magnitude 1.6 when the planet is in conjunction with the sun 10 mars usually appears distinctly yellow orange or red the actual color of mars is closer to butterscotch and the redness seen is just dust in the planet s atmosphere nasa s spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand 237 when farthest away from earth it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest when least favorably positioned it can be lost in the sun s glare for months at a time at its most favorable times at 15- or 17-year intervals and always between late july and late september a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope especially noticeable even at low magnification are the polar ice caps 238 as mars approaches opposition it begins a period of retrograde motion which means it will appear to move backwards in a looping motion with respect to the background stars the duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days and mars reaches its peak luminosity in the middle of this motion 239 closest approaches relative the point at which mars s geocentric longitude is 180 different from the sun s is known as opposition which is near the time of closest approach to earth the time of opposition can occur as much as 8.5 days away from the closest approach the distance at close approach varies between about 54 240 and about 103 million km due to the planets elliptical orbits which causes comparable variation in angular size 241 the last mars opposition occurred on may 22 2016 at a distance of about 76 million km 242 the next mars opposition occurs on july 27 2018 at a distance of about 58 million km 242 the average time between the successive oppositions of mars its synodic period is 780 days but the number of days between the dates of successive oppositions can range from 764 to 812 243 as mars approaches opposition it begins a period of retrograde motion which makes it appear to move backwards in a looping motion relative to the background stars the duration of this retrograde motion is about 72 days absolute around the present time mars oppositions from 2003 2018 viewed from above the ecliptic with earth centered mars made its closest approach to earth and maximum apparent brightness in nearly 60,000 years 55,758,006 km 0.37271925 au 34,646,419 mi magnitude 2.88 on august 27 2003 at 9 51 13 ut this occurred when mars was one day from opposition and about three days from its perihelion making it particularly easy to see from earth the last time it came so close is estimated to have been on september 12 57,617 bc the next time being in 2287 244 this record approach was only slightly closer than other recent close approaches for instance the minimum distance on august 22 1924 was 7010557775660904950 0.37285 au and the minimum distance on august 24 2208 will be 7010557685902182530 0.37279 au 178 historical observations the history of observations of mars is marked by the oppositions of mars when the planet is closest to earth and hence is most easily visible which occur every couple of years even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of mars which occur every 15 or 17 years and are distinguished because mars is close to perihelion making it even closer to earth ancient and medieval observations the ancient sumerians believed that mars was nergal the god of war and plague 245 during sumerian times nergal was a minor deity of little significance 245 but during later times his main cult center was the city of nineveh 245 in mesopotamian texts mars is referred to as the star of judgement of the fate of the dead 246 the existence of mars as a wandering object in the night sky was recorded by the ancient egyptian astronomers and by 1534 bce they were familiar with the retrograde motion of the planet 247 by the period of the neo-babylonian empire the babylonian astronomers were making regular records of the positions of the planets and systematic observations of their behavior for mars they knew that the planet made 37 synodic periods or 42 circuits of the zodiac every 79 years they invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets 248 249 in the fourth century bce aristotle noted that mars disappeared behind the moon during an occultation indicating that the planet was farther away 250 ptolemy a greek living in alexandria 251 attempted to address the problem of the orbital motion of mars ptolemy s model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection almagest which became the authoritative treatise on western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries 252 literature from ancient china confirms that mars was known by chinese astronomers by no later than the fourth century bce 253 in the fifth century ce the indian astronomical text surya siddhanta estimated the diameter of mars 254 in the east asian cultures mars is traditionally referred to as the fire star based on the five elements 255 256 257 during the seventeenth century tycho brahe measured the diurnal parallax of mars that johannes kepler used to make a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet 258 when the telescope became available the diurnal parallax of mars was again measured in an effort to determine the sun-earth distance this was first performed by giovanni domenico cassini in 1672 the early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments 259 the only occultation of mars by venus observed was that of october 13 1590 seen by michael maestlin at heidelberg 260 in 1610 mars was viewed by galileo galilei who was first to see it via telescope 261 the first person to draw a map of mars that displayed any terrain features was the dutch astronomer christiaan huygens 262 martian canals map of mars by giovanni schiaparelli mars sketched as observed by lowell before 1914 south on top map of mars from the hubble space telescope as seen near the 1999 opposition north on top by the 19th century the resolution of telescopes reached a level sufficient for surface features to be identified a perihelic opposition of mars occurred on september 5 1877 in that year the italian astronomer giovanni schiaparelli used a 22 cm 8.7 in telescope in milan to help produce the first detailed map of mars these maps notably contained features he called canali which were later shown to be an optical illusion these canali were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on earth his term which means channels or grooves was popularly mistranslated in english as canals 263 264 influenced by the observations the orientalist percival lowell founded an observatory which had 30 and 45 cm 12 and 18 in telescopes the observatory was used for the exploration of mars during the last good opportunity in 1894 and the following less favorable oppositions he published several books on mars and life on the planet which had a great influence on the public 265 266 the canali were independently found by other astronomers like henri joseph perrotin and louis thollon in nice using one of the largest telescopes of that time 267 268 the seasonal changes consisting of the diminishing of the polar caps and the dark areas formed during martian summer in combination with the canals led to speculation about life on mars and it was a long-held belief that mars contained vast seas and vegetation the telescope never reached the resolution required to give proof to any speculations as bigger telescopes were used fewer long straight canali were observed during an observation in 1909 by flammarion with an 84 cm 33 in telescope irregular patterns were observed but no canali were seen 269 even in the 1960s articles were published on martian biology putting aside explanations other than life for the seasonal changes on mars detailed scenarios for the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem have been published 270 spacecraft visitation once spacecraft visited the planet during nasa s mariner missions in the 1960s and 70s these concepts were radically broken the results of the viking life-detection experiments aided an intermission in which the hypothesis of a hostile dead planet was generally accepted 271 mariner 9 and viking allowed better maps of mars to be made using the data from these missions and another major leap forward was the mars global surveyor mission launched in 1996 and operated until late 2006 that allowed complete extremely detailed maps of the martian topography magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained 272 these maps are available online for example at google mars mars reconnaissance orbiter and mars express continued exploring with new instruments and supporting lander missions nasa provides two online tools mars trek which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration and experience curiosity which simulates traveling on mars in 3-d with curiosity 273 in culture mars is named after the roman god of war in different cultures mars represents masculinity and youth its symbol a circle with an arrow pointing out to the upper right is used as a symbol for the male gender the many failures in mars exploration probes resulted in a satirical counter-culture blaming the failures on an earth-mars bermuda triangle a mars curse or a great galactic ghoul that feeds on martian spacecraft 274 intelligent martians the fashionable idea that mars was populated by intelligent martians exploded in the late 19th century schiaparelli s canali observations combined with percival lowell s books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying cooling dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works 275 an 1893 soap ad playing on the popular idea that mars was populated many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed mars fever 276 in 1899 while investigating atmospheric radio noise using his receivers in his colorado springs lab inventor nikola tesla observed repetitive signals that he later surmised might have been radio communications coming from another planet possibly mars in a 1901 interview tesla said it was some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that the disturbances i had observed might be due to an intelligent control although i could not decipher their meaning it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental the feeling is constantly growing on me that i had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another 277 tesla s theories gained support from lord kelvin who while visiting the united states in 1902 was reported to have said that he thought tesla had picked up martian signals being sent to the united states 278 kelvin emphatically denied this report shortly before leaving what i really said was that the inhabitants of mars if there are any were doubtless able to see new york particularly the glare of the electricity 279 in a new york times article in 1901 edward charles pickering director of the harvard college observatory said that they had received a telegram from lowell observatory in arizona that seemed to confirm that mars was trying to communicate with earth 280 early in december 1900 we received from lowell observatory in arizona a telegram that a shaft of light had been seen to project from mars the lowell observatory makes a specialty of mars lasting seventy minutes i wired these facts to europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country the observer there is a careful reliable man and there is no reason to doubt that the light existed it was given as from a well-known geographical point on mars that was all now the story has gone the world over in europe it is stated that i have been in communication with mars and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up whatever the light was we have no means of knowing whether it had intelligence or not no one can say it is absolutely inexplicable 280 pickering later proposed creating a set of mirrors in texas intended to signal martians 281 in recent decades the high-resolution mapping of the surface of mars culminating in mars global surveyor revealed no artifacts of habitation by intelligent life but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on mars continues from commentators such as richard c hoagland reminiscent of the canali controversy these speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images such as pyramids and the face on mars planetary astronomer carl sagan wrote mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our earthly hopes and fears 264 martian tripod illustration from the 1906 french edition of the war of the worlds by h g wells the depiction of mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life 282 thus originated a large number of science fiction scenarios among which is h g wells the war of the worlds published in 1898 in which martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading earth influential works included ray bradbury s the martian chronicles in which human explorers accidentally destroy a martian civilization edgar rice burroughs barsoom series c s lewis novel out of the silent planet 1938 283 and a number of robert a heinlein stories before the mid-sixties 284 jonathan swift made reference to the moons of mars about 150 years before their actual discovery by asaph hall detailing reasonably accurate descriptions of their orbits in the 19th chapter of his novel gulliver s travels 285 a comic figure of an intelligent martian marvin the martian appeared in haredevil hare 1948 as a character in the looney tunes animated cartoons of warner brothers and has continued as part of popular culture to the present 286 after the mariner and viking spacecraft had returned pictures of mars as it really is an apparently lifeless and canal-less world these ideas about mars had to be abandoned and a vogue for accurate realist depictions of human colonies on mars developed the best known of which may be kim stanley robinson s mars trilogy pseudo-scientific speculations about
