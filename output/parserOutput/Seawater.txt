water ocean salinity at different latitudes in the atlantic and pacific seawater or salt water is water from a sea or ocean on average seawater in the world s oceans has a salinity of about 3.5 35 g l 599 mm this means that every kilogram roughly one litre by volume of seawater has approximately 35 grams 1.2 oz of dissolved salts predominantly sodium na and chloride cl ions average density at the surface is 1.025 kg l seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water density 1.0 kg l at 4 c 39 f because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume the freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases at typical salinity it freezes at about 2 c 28 f 1 the coldest seawater ever recorded in a liquid state was in 2010 in a stream under an antarctic glacier and measured 2.6 c 27.3 f 2 seawater ph is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4 3 however there is no universally accepted reference ph-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units 4 contents 1 geochemistry 1.1 salinity 1.2 thermophysical properties of seawater 2 compositional

surface salinity expressed in the practical salinity scale for the world ocean data from the world ocean atlas 5 although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 31 g kg and 38 g kg that is 3.1-3.8 seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths near melting glaciers or vast amounts of precipitation e g monsoon seawater can be substantially less saline the most saline open sea is the red sea where high rates of evaporation low precipitation and low river run-off and confined circulation result in unusually salty water the salinity in isolated bodies of water can be considerably greater still - about ten times higher in the case of the dead sea historically several salinity scales were used to approximate the absolute salinity of seawater a popular scale was the practical salinity scale where salinity was measured in practical salinity units psu the current standard for salinity is the reference salinity scale 6 with the salinity expressed in units of g kg thermophysical properties of seawater edit the density of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029 kg m3 depending on the temperature and salinity at a temperature of 25 c salinity of 35 g kg and 1 atm pressure the density of seawater is 1023.6 kg m3 7 8 deep in the ocean under high pressure seawater can reach a density of 1050 kg m3 or higher the density of seawater also changes with salinity brines generated by seawater desalination plants can have salinities up to 120 g kg the density of typical seawater brine of 120 g kg salinity at 25 c and atmospheric pressure is 1088 kg m3 7 8 seawater ph is limited to the range 7.5 to 8.4 the speed of sound in seawater is about 1,500 m s whereas speed of sound is usually around 330 m s in air at roughly 1000hpa pressure 1 atmosphere and varies with water temperature salinity and pressure the thermal conductivity of seawater is 0.6 w mk at 25 c and a salinity of 35 g kg 9 the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing salinity and increases with increasing temperature 10 compositional differences from freshwater edit seawater elemental composition salinity 3.5 element percent by mass oxygen 85.84 hydrogen 10.82 chloride 1.94 sodium 1.08 magnesium 0.1292 sulphur 0.091 calcium 0.04 potassium 0.04 bromide 0.0067 carbon 0.0028 vanadium 1.5 10 11 3.3 10 11 seawater contains more dissolved ions than all types of freshwater 11 however the ratios of solutes differ dramatically for instance although seawater contains about 2.8 times more bicarbonate than river water the percentage of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of all dissolved ions is far lower than in river water bicarbonate ions constitute 48 of river water solutes but only 0.14 for seawater 11 12 differences like these are due to the varying residence times of seawater solutes sodium and chloride have very long residence times while calcium vital for carbonate formation tends to precipitate much more quickly 12 the most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium chloride magnesium sulfate and calcium 13 its osmolarity is about 1000 mosm l 14 small amounts of other substances are found including amino acids at concentrations of up to 2 micrograms of nitrogen atoms per liter 15 which are thought to have played a key role in the origin of life microbial components edit research in 1957 by the scripps institution of oceanography sampled water in both pelagic and neritic locations in the pacific ocean direct microscopic counts and cultures were used the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures these differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates selective effects of the culture media and the presence of inactive cells a marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the thermocline but not by direct microscopic observation large numbers of spirilli-like forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation the disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields 16 in the 1990s improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small snippets of dna enabled researchers taking part in the census of marine life to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers this revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20,000 species dr mitchell sogin from the marine biological laboratory feels that the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million 17 bacteria are found at all depths in the water column as well as in the sediments some being aerobic others anaerobic most are free-swimming but some exist as symbionts within other organisms examples of these being bioluminescent bacteria cyanobacteria played an important role in the evolution of ocean processes enabling the development of stromatolites and oxygen in the atmosphere some bacteria interact with diatoms and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean one anaerobic species thiomargarita namibiensis plays an important part in the breakdown of hydrogen sulphide eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the namibian coast and generated by high rates of phytoplankton growth in the benguela current upwelling zone eventually falling to the seafloor bacteria-like archaea surprised marine microbiologists by their survival and thriving in extreme environments such as the hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor alkalotolerant marine bacteria such as pseudomonas and vibrio spp survive in a ph range of 7.3 to 10.6 while some species will grow only at ph 10 to 10.6 18 archaea also exist in pelagic waters and may constitute as much as half the ocean s biomass clearly playing an important part in oceanic processes 19 in 2000 sediments from the ocean floor revealed a species of archaea that breaks down methane an important greenhouse gas and a major contributor to atmospheric warming 20 some bacteria break down the rocks of the sea floor influencing seawater chemistry oil spills and runoff containing human sewage and chemical pollutants have a marked effect on microbial life in the vicinity as well as harbouring pathogens and toxins affecting all forms of marine life the protist dinoflagellates may at certain times undergo population explosions called blooms or red tides often after human-caused pollution the process may produce metabolites known as biotoxins which move along the ocean food chain tainting higher-order animal consumers pandoravirus salinus a species of very large virus with a genome much larger than that of any other virus species was discovered in 2013 like the other very large viruses mimivirus and megavirus pandoravirus infects amoebas but its genome containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of dna is twice as large as that of megavirus and it differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure in 2013 researchers from aberdeen university announced that they were starting a hunt for undiscovered chemicals in organisms that have evolved in deep sea trenches hoping to find the next generation of antibiotics anticipating an antibiotic apocalypse with a dearth of new infection-fighting drugs the eu-funded research will start in the atacama trench and then move on to search trenches off new zealand and antarctica 21 the ocean has a long history of human waste disposal on the assumption that its vast size makes it capable of absorbing and diluting all noxious material 22 while this may be true on a small scale the large amounts of sewage routinely dumped has damaged many coastal ecosystems and rendered them life-threatening pathogenic viruses and bacteria occur in such waters such as escherichia coli vibrio cholerae the cause of cholera hepatitis a hepatitis e and polio along with protozoans causing giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis these pathogens are routinely present in the ballast water of large vessels and are widely spread when the ballast is discharged 23 origin edit diagram showing concentrations of various salt ions in seawater the composition of the total salt component is cl 55 na 30.6 so2 4 7.7 mg2 3.7 ca2 1.2 k 1.1 other 0.7 note

salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers after rainfall washed it out of the ground upon reaching the ocean these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time see hydrologic cycle halley noted that most lakes that don t have ocean outlets such as the dead sea and the caspian sea see endorheic basin have high salt content halley termed this process continental weathering halley s theory was partly correct in addition sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed the presence of salt s other dominant ion chloride results from outgassing of chloride as hydrochloric acid with other gases from earth s interior via volcanos and hydrothermal vents the sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt ocean salinity has been stable for billions of years most likely as a consequence of a chemical tectonic system which removes as much salt as is deposited for instance sodium and chloride sinks include evaporite deposits pore-water burial and reactions with seafloor basalts 12 133 human impacts edit climate change rising atmospheric carbon dioxide excess nutrients and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record major trends include an increasing acidity reduced subsurface oxygen in both near-shore and pelagic waters rising coastal nitrogen levels and widespread increases in mercury and persistent organic pollutants most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion fertilizer and industrial activity concentrations are projected to grow in coming decades with negative impacts on ocean biota and other marine resources 25 one of the most striking features of this is ocean acidification resulting from increased co2 uptake of the oceans related to higher atmospheric concentration of co2 and higher temperatures 26 because it severely affects coral reefs and crustaceans see coral bleaching human consumption edit accidentally consuming small quantities of clean seawater is not harmful especially if the seawater is taken along with a larger quantity of fresh water however drinking seawater to maintain hydration is counterproductive more water must be excreted to eliminate the salt via urine than the amount of water obtained from the seawater itself 27 the renal system actively regulates sodium chloride in the blood within a very narrow range around 9 g l 0.9 by weight in most open waters concentrations vary somewhat around typical values of about 3.5 far higher than the body can tolerate and most beyond what the kidney can process a point frequently overlooked in claims that the kidney can excrete nacl in baltic concentrations of 2 in arguments to the contrary is that the gut cannot absorb water at such concentrations so that there is no benefit in drinking such water drinking seawater temporarily increases blood s nacl concentration this signals the kidney to excrete sodium but seawater s sodium concentration is above the kidney s maximum concentrating ability eventually the blood s sodium concentration rises to toxic levels removing water from cells and interfering with nerve conduction ultimately producing fatal seizure and cardiac arrhythmia citation needed survival manuals consistently advise against drinking seawater 28 a summary of 163 life raft voyages estimated the risk of death at 39 for those who drank seawater compared to 3 for those who did not the effect of seawater intake on rats confirmed the negative effects of drinking seawater when dehydrated 29 the temptation to drink seawater was greatest for sailors who had expended their supply of fresh water and were unable to capture enough rainwater for drinking this frustration was described famously by a line from samuel taylor coleridge s the rime of the ancient mariner water water everywhere and all the boards did shrink water water everywhere nor any drop to drink although humans cannot survive on seawater some people claim that up to two cups a day mixed with fresh water in a 2 3 ratio produces no ill effect the french physician alain bombard survived an ocean crossing in a small zodiak rubber boat using mainly raw fish meat which contains about 40 percent water like most living tissues as well as small amounts of seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean his findings were challenged but an alternative explanation was not given in his 1948 book kon-tiki thor heyerdahl reported drinking seawater mixed with fresh in a 2 3 ratio during the 1947 expedition 30 a few years later another adventurer william willis claimed to have drunk two cups of seawater and one cup of fresh per day for 70 days without ill effect when he lost part of his water supply 31 during the 18th century richard russell advocated the practice s medical use in the uk and ren quinton expanded the advocation of the practice other countries notably france in the 20th century currently the practice is widely used in nicaragua and other countries supposedly taking advantage of the latest medical discoveries most ocean-going vessels desalinate potable water from seawater using processes such as vacuum distillation or multi-stage flash distillation in an evaporator or more recently reverse osmosis these energy-intensive processes were not usually available during the age of sail larger sailing warships with large crews such as nelson s hms victory were fitted with distilling apparatuses in their galleys 32 animals such as fish whales sea turtles and seabirds such as penguins and albatrosses have adapted to living in a high saline habitat for example sea turtles and saltwater crocodiles remove excess salt from their bodies through their tear ducts 33 standard edit astm international has an international standard for artificial seawater astm d1141-98 original standard astm d1141-52 it is used in many research testing labs as a reproducible solution for seawater such as tests on corrosion oil contamination and detergency evaluation 34 see also edit listen
