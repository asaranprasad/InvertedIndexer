humid subtropical climate - wikipedia humid subtropical climate from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search warm temperate with hot summer climate zones of the world according to a modified k ppen climate classification that uses a threshold of 0 c 32 f for the coldest month cfa cwa a humid subtropical climate or chinese type climate is a zone of climate characterized by hot humid summers and mild winters these climates normally lie on the southeast side of all continents generally between latitudes 30 and 50 and are located poleward from adjacent tropical climates while many subtropical climates tend to be on or near a coast in some cases they extend inland most notably in china and the united states us under the k ppen climate classification cfa and cwa climates are described as humid mild temperate climates this climate features mean temperatures in the coldest month between 3 c 27 f and 18 c 64 f 1 in 1966 the trewartha climate classification was created to update the k ppen climate classification and it sought to redefine middle latitude climates into smaller zones the original k ppen system grouped all middle latitude climates into a single zone which was the major criticism under the trewartha system climates are subtropical when they have monthly mean air temperatures higher than 10 c 50 f for eight or more months a year and at least one month with mean temperature below 18 c 64.4 f it classifies humid subtropical climates as typically occupying the southernmost portions of the temperate zone from 23.5 to 35.0 north and south latitude and they often have a mean temperature of 7 c 45 f or higher in the coldest month 2 rainfall often shows a summer peak especially where monsoons are well developed as in southeast asia and florida us other areas have a more uniform or varying rainfall cycles but consistently lack any predictably dry summer months most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms that build up due to the intense surface heating and strong subtropical angle of the sun weak tropical lows that move in from adjacent warm tropical oceans as well as infrequent tropical storms often contribute to summer seasonal rainfall peaks winter rainfall is often associated with large storms in the westerlies that have fronts reaching down into subtropical latitudes however many subtropical climates such as southeast asia and florida have very dry winters with frequent brush fires and water shortages contents 1 africa 2 asia 2.1 east southeast asia 2.2 south asia 2.3 western asia 3 north america 4 south america 5

separate areas on the southern hemisphere of the continent the cwa climate is found over a large portion of the interior of the middle and eastern african regions this area includes central angola northeastern zimbabwe the niassa manica and tete provinces of mozambique the southern congo provinces southwest tanzania and the majority of malawi and zambia some lower portions of the ethiopian highlands also have this climate the climate is also found in the narrow coastal sections of southern and eastern south africa primarily in kwazulu-natal and the eastern cape provinces south africa s version of this climate features heavy oceanic influences resulting in generally milder temperatures this is particularly evident in its winters when temperatures do not drop as low as in many other regions within the humid subtropical category asia edit east southeast asia edit in east and southeast asia this climate type is found in the southeastern quarter of mainland china the northern half of taiwan northern myanmar northern vietnam narrow areas along the coast of south korea and japan kyushu shikoku and half of honshu cities near the equatorward boundary of this zone include hong kong hanoi and taipei while qingdao and tokyo are near the northern boundary the influence of the strong siberian anticyclone in east asia brings colder winter temperatures southward pushing the 0 c isotherm as far south as the valleys of the yellow and wei roughly latitude 34 n at hainan island and in taiwan the climate transitions from subtropical into fully tropical in most of this region there is extremely limited precipitation during the winter owing to the powerful anticyclonic winds from siberia only in inland areas below the yangtze river and coastal areas between approximately the huai river and the beginning of the coast of guangdong is there sufficient winter rainfall to produce a cfa climate even in these areas rainfall and streamflow display a highly pronounced summer peak unlike other regions of this climate type drought can be severe and often catastrophic to agriculture in the cwa zone the only area where winter precipitation equals or even exceeds the summer rain is on the san-in sea of japan or western coast of japan which during winter is on the windward side of the westerlies the winter precipitation in these regions is usually produced by low-pressure systems off the east coast that develop in the onshore flow from the siberian high summer rainfall comes from the east asian monsoon and from frequent typhoons annual rainfall is generally over 1,000 millimetres 39 in and in areas below the himalayas can be much higher still tokyo japan climate chart explanation j f m a m j j a s o n d 52 10 1 56 10 2 118 14 4 125 19 9 138 23 14 168 26 18 154 29

also be found in south asia primarily along the ganges river however the humid subtropical climates exhibited here differ markedly from those in east asia and for that matter a good portion of the globe winters here are typically mild dry and relatively short they also tend to be foggy summers tend to be long and very hot starting from mid-april and peaking in may and early june with high temperatures often exceeding 40 c 104 f they also tend to be extremely dry complete with dust storms traits usually associated with arid or semi-arid climates during this period many native trees defoliate to save water this is followed by the cooler monsoons where the region experiences heavy rains on almost a daily basis average high temperatures decreases during the monsoon season but the humidity increases this results in hot and humid conditions similar to summers in other humid subtropical climates cities such as new delhi lucknow kanpur and patna exhibit this atypical version of the climate in india in pakistan the twin cities of rawalpindi islamabad also feature this weather pattern but with wetter and relatively cooler winters sialkot is another major city in pakistan that features a humid subtropical climate in south asia humid subtropical climates generally border on continental climates as altitude increases or on winter-rainfall climates in western areas of pakistan

prevalent in the gilan and m zandar n provinces of iran in parts of the caucasus in azerbaijan and in georgia wedged between the caspian and black seas and coastal black sea turkey albeit having more oceanic influence annual rainfall ranges from around 740 mm 29 inches at sari to over 2,000 mm 78 inches at bandar-e anzali and is heavy throughout the year with a maximum in october or november when bandar-e anzali can average 400 millimetres 16 inches temperatures are generally moderate in comparison with other parts of western asia during winter the coastal areas can receive snowfall which is

america humid subtropical climates are almost exclusively the domain of the american gulf and south atlantic states this zone extends for extreme southeast virginia through eastern north carolina south carolina georgia and florida then westward through alabama mississippi louisiana arkansas and eastern texas on the florida peninsula the humid subtropical climate gives way to the tropical climate of south florida and the florida keys in mexico there are small areas of cfa and cwa climates the climate can be found in small areas scattered around the northeastern part of the country in proximity to the gulf of mexico other areas where the climate can be found are in the high elevations of trans-mexican volcanic belt and sierra madre oriental despite being located at higher elevations these locations have summers that are too warm to qualify as a subtropical highland climate guadalajara s climate is a major example of this outside of isolated sections of mexico the southernmost limits of this climate in north america lie just north of south florida and around southern coastal texas cities at these southernmost limits such as orlando tampa corpus christi and brownsville texas generally feature warm weather year-round and minimal temperature differences between seasons in contrast cities at the northernmost limits of the humid subtropical region such dallas memphis atlanta and norfolk feature hot humid summers and chilly winters these areas have average winter temperatures at the coldest limit of climates classed as humid subtropical precipitation is plentiful in the humid subtropical climate zone in north america but with significant variations in terms of wettest driest months and seasons much of the interior areas including the northern halves of mississippi and alabama tend to have a winter or spring not summer precipitation maximum closer to the south atlantic and gulf coasts there gradually becomes a more summer maximum with july or august usually the wettest month as at norfolk cape hatteras and jacksonville north carolina charleston south carolina mobile alabama and new orleans the monsoon pattern becomes much stronger in the southern portion of the region on the florida peninsula as most locations in florida have quite dry winters and wet summers in addition areas in texas that are slightly inland from the gulf of mexico such as austin and san antonio that border the semi-arid climate zone generally see a peak of precipitation in may a drought-like nadir in mid-summer and a secondary if not equal precipitation peak in september or october districts further south along south texas gulf coast corpus christi and brownsville which closely border the tropical climate classification or semi-arid zone typically have a strong september precipitation maximum and a tendency toward dry conditions in late winter and spring with march or april often the driest months the freeze free season ranges from 200 days in the far northern areas to 330 days a year in southern areas snowfall is rare in winter with locations in the southern portions of this zone like jacksonville houston new orleans or savannah seeing snow a few times per generation while far northern areas like atlanta memphis nashville dallas or raleigh seeing small amounts of snow once or twice each winter season hurricanes are a hazard along

towards dubbo to the northwest and wagga wagga to the south ending at the new south wales victoria border albury wodonga 10 to note these places would have characteristics of the semi-arid and or mediterranean climates furthermore the inland cfa climates generally have drier summers or at least summers with low humidity 11 extreme heat is more often experienced in sydney than in other large cities in australia s cfa zone especially in the western suburbs where highs over 40 c are not uncommon frost is prevalent in the more inland areas of sydney such as richmond average annual rainfall in the sydney region ranges between 800 mm and 1200 mm 12 there is usually a distinct summer rainfall maximum that becomes more pronounced moving northwards in brisbane the wettest month february receives five times the rainfall of the driest september temperatures are very warm to hot but not excessive the average maximum in february is usually around 29 c 84 f and in july around 21 c 70 f frosts are extremely rare except at higher elevations but temperatures over 35 c 95 f are not common on the coast north of the cfa climate zone there is a zone centred upon rockhampton and extending up to the atherton tableland of k ppen cwa climate this has a very pronounced dry winter with often negligible rainfall between june and october and winter temperatures generally only slightly below 18 c above which one would have a tropical savanna or aw climate annual rainfall on the coast can reach as high as 2,000 mm 80 inches in coastal locations and is generally above 1,000 mm 40 inches however because most of the heaviest two- and three-day rainfalls in the world occur in this coastal zone as a result of east coast lows forming to the north of a large high pressure system there can be great variation in rainfall from year to year at lismore in the centre of this zone the annual rainfall can range from less than 550 mm 22 inches in 1915 to more than 2,780 mm 110 inches in 1950 13

and continental climates in areas where higher summer temperature do not quite qualify it for inclusion in the oceanic climate schema but in the trewartha climate classification this type of climate is included in that typical of the other areas of central-west europe classified as do -the temperate oceanic climate- and mild winters do not allow their inclusion into continental climates average summer temperatures in areas of europe with this climate are generally not as hot as most other subtropical zones around the world the po valley in northern italy including major cities such as milan turin bologna and verona have a humid subtropical climate featuring hot humid summers with frequent thunderstorms winters are foggy damp and chilly with sudden bursts of frost some parts of the valley have a mild continental climate places along the shores of lake maggiore lake lugano lake como como and verbania in italy and lugano in switzerland have a humid subtropical climate with a distinctive high amount of rainfall during summer the coastal areas in the northern half of the adriatic sea also fall within this climate zone the cities include trieste venice and rimini in italy split in croatia koper in slovenia and kotor in montenegro other southern european areas in the cfa zone include the central valleys and coast of catalonia of girona and barcelona in spain some on the north-east of spain huesca the garonne valley toulouse and rhone valley avignon in france along the black sea coast of bulgaria varna coast of romania constanta and mamaia sochi russia and crimea have summers too warm 22 c in the warmest month to qualify as oceanic no freezing month and enough summer precipitation and sometimes humid conditions where they would be fit to be classed under cfa though they closely border the humid continental zone all these areas are subject to occasional in some cases repeated snowfalls and freezes during winter in the azores some islands have this climate with very mild and rainy winters 13 c and no snowfall warm summers 21 or 22 c but with no dry season during the warmest period which means that they can be classified neither as oceanic nor as mediterranean but only as humid subtropical climate as with corvo island in many other climate classification systems outside of the k ppen most of these locations would not be included in the humid
