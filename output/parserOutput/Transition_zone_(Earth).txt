transition zone earth - wikipedia transition zone earth from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the transition zone is part of the earth s mantle and is located between the lower mantle and the upper mantle between a depth of 410 and 660 km 250 to 400 mi the earth s mantle including the transition zone consists primarily of peridotite an ultramafic igneous rock the mantle was divided into the upper mantle transition zone and lower mantle as a result of sudden seismic-velocity discontinuities at depths of 410 and 660 km 250 to 400 mi this is thought to occur as a result of rearrangement of atoms in olivine which constitutes a large portion of peridotite at a depth of 410 km to form a denser crystal structure as a result of the increase in pressure with increasing depth below a depth of 660 km evidence suggests that atoms rearrange yet again to form an even denser crystal structure this can be seen using body waves from earthquakes which are converted reflected or refracted at the boundary and predicted from mineral physics as the phase changes are temperature and density-dependent and hence depth dependent contents 1 410 km discontinuity - phase transition 2 660 km discontinuity -phase transition 3 other discontinuities 4 references 410 km discontinuity - phase transition edit a single peak is seen in all seismological data at 410 km which is predicted by the single transition from - to - mg2sio4 olivine to wadsleyite from the clapeyron slope the moho discontinuity is expected to be shallower in cold regions such as subducting slabs and deeper in warmer regions such as mantle plumes 1 660 km discontinuity -phase transition edit this is the most complex discontinuity seen it appears in pp precursors a wave which reflects off the discontinuity once only in certain regions but is always apparent in ss precursors it is seen as single and double reflections in receiver functions for p to s conversions over a broad range of depths 640 720 km or 397 447 mi the clapeyron slope predicts a deeper discontinuity in cold regions and a shallower discontinuity in hot regions 1 this discontinuity is generally linked to the transition from ringwoodite to bridgmanite and periclase 2 this is thermodynamically an exothermic reaction and creates a viscosity jump both characteristics cause this phase transition to play an important role in geodynamical models cold downwelling material might pond on this transition 3 other discontinuities edit there is another major phase transition predicted at 520 km for the transition of olivine to and garnet in the pyrolite mantle 4 this one is only sporadically been observed in seismological data 5 other non-global phase transitions have been suggested at a range of depths 1 6 references edit a b c c m r fowler the solid earth 2nd edition cambridge university press 2005 ito e takahashi e 1989 journal of geophysical research solid earth 94 b8 10637 10646 bibcode doi retrieved 31 may 2015 fukao y obayashi m 2013 journal of geophysical research solid earth 118 11 5920 5938 bibcode doi deuss arwen woodhouse john 2001-10-12 science 294 5541 354 357 bibcode doi issn pmid egorkin a v 1997-01-01 fuchs karl ed nato asi series springer netherlands pp 51 61 isbn 9789048149667 khan amir deschamps fr d ric 2015-04-28 springer isbn 9783319156279 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title transition zone earth oldid 823995602 categories structure of the earth navigation menu search this page was last edited on 4 february 2018 at 18 24 text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipedia is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
