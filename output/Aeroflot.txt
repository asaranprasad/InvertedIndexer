foreign aircraft over the soviet union s airspace and territory after lenin issued an order a state commission was formed on 31 january 1921 for the purpose of civil aviation planning in the soviet union as a result of the commission s plans glavvozdukhflot chief administration of the civil air fleet russian was established and it began mail and passenger flights on the moscow-oryol-kursk-kharkov route on 1 may 1921 using sikorsky ilya muromets aircraft 9 1 this was followed by the formation of deruluft-deutsch russische luftverkehrs a g in berlin on 11 november 1921

of the soviet union congress in 1933 set out development plans for the civil aviation industry for the following five years which would see air transportation becoming one of the primary means of transportation in the soviet union linking all major cities the government also implemented plans to expand the soviet aircraft industry to make it less dependent on foreign built aircraft 9 10 11 in

local routes mvl were also expanded and by 1940 some 337 mvl routes saw operations on a scheduled basis serial production of the lisunov li-2 license-built douglas dc-3 commenced in 1939 and the aircraft became the backbone of aeroflot s fleet on mainline trunk routes when the soviet union was invaded by nazi germany on 22 june 1941 the following day the sovnarkom placed the civil air fleet under the control of narkomat leading to the full-scale mobilisation of aeroflot crews and technicians for the soviet war effort prior to the invasion the aeroflot network extended over some 146,000

aeroflot had by the end of 1945 carried 537,000 passengers compared with 359,000 in 1940 9 16 the government made it a priority in the immediate postwar years to expand services from moscow to the capital of the union republics in addition to important industrial centres on the country to enable this the government transferred to aeroflot a large number of lisunov li-2s and they would become the backbone of the fleet 9 17 the ilyushin il-12 entered service on aeroflot s all-union scheduled routes on 22 august 1947 and supplemented already existing li-2 services the original ilyushin il-18
