infobox references silicon dioxide also known as silica from the latin silex is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula sio2 most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various living organisms 5 6 in many parts of the world silica is the major constituent of sand silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials existing as a compound of several minerals and as synthetic product notable examples include fused quartz fumed silica silica gel and aerogels it is used in structural materials microelectronics and as components in the food and pharmaceutical industries inhaling finely divided crystalline silica is toxic and can lead to silicosis bronchitis lung cancer and systemic autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis contents 1

6 health effects 6.1 occupational hazard 6.2 pathophysiology 6.3 regulation 7 crystalline forms 8 see also 9 references 10 external links structure edit structural motif found in -quartz but also found in almost all forms of silicon dioxide in the majority of silicates the si atom shows tetrahedral coordination with four oxygen atoms surrounding a central si atom the most common example is seen in the quartzite polymorph relationship between refractive index and density for some sio 2 forms 7 for example in the unit cell of -quartz the central tetrahedron shares all four of its corner o atoms the two face-centered tetrahedra share two of their corner o atoms and the four edge-centered tetrahedra share just one of their o atoms with other sio4 tetrahedra this leaves a net average of 12 out of 24 total vertices for that portion of the seven sio4 tetrahedra that are considered to be a part of the unit cell for silica sio2 has a number of distinct crystalline forms polymorphs in addition to amorphous forms with the exception of stishovite and fibrous silica all of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral sio4 units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements silicon oxygen bond lengths vary between the different crystal forms for example in -quartz the bond length is 161 pm whereas in -tridymite it is in the range 154 171 pm the si-o-si angle also varies between a low value of 140 in -tridymite up to 180 in -tridymite in -quartz the si-o-si angle is 144 8 fibrous silica has a structure similar to that of sis2 with chains of edge-sharing sio4 tetrahedra stishovite the higher-pressure form in contrast has a rutile-like structure where silicon is 6-coordinate the density of stishovite is 4.287 g cm3 which compares to -quartz the densest of the low-pressure forms which has a density of 2.648 g cm3 9 the difference in density can be ascribed to the increase in coordination as the six shortest si-o bond lengths in stishovite four si-o bond lengths of 176 pm and two others of 181 pm are greater than the si-o bond length 161 pm in -quartz 10 the change in the coordination increases the ionicity of the si-o bond 11 more importantly any deviations from these standard parameters constitute microstructural differences or variations which represent an approach to an amorphous vitreous or glassy solid the only stable form under normal conditions is alpha quartz in which crystalline silicon dioxide is usually encountered in nature impurities in crystalline -quartz can give rise to colors see list the high-temperature minerals cristobalite and tridymite have both lower densities and indices of refraction than quartz since the composition is identical the reason for the discrepancies must be in the increased spacing in the high-temperature minerals as is common with many substances the higher the temperature the farther apart the atoms are due to the increased vibration energy citation needed the transformation from -quartz to beta-quartz takes place abruptly at 573 c since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature limit citation needed the high-pressure minerals seifertite stishovite and coesite though have higher densities and indices of refraction than quartz this is probably due to the intense compression of the atoms occurring during their formation resulting in more condensed structure citation needed faujasite silica is another form of crystalline silica it is obtained by dealumination of a low-sodium ultra-stable y zeolite with combined acid and thermal treatment the resulting product contains over 99 silica and has high crystallinity and surface area over 800 m2 g faujasite-silica has very high thermal and acid stability for example it maintains a high degree of long-range molecular order or crystallinity even after boiling in concentrated hydrochloric acid 12 molten silica exhibits several peculiar physical characteristics that are similar to those observed in liquid water negative temperature expansion density maximum at temperatures 5000 c and a heat capacity minimum 13 its density decreases from 2.08 g cm3 at 1950 c to 2.03 g cm3 at 2200 c 14 molecular sio2 with a linear structure is produced when molecular silicon monoxide sio is condensed in an argon matrix cooled with helium along with oxygen atoms generated by microwave discharge dimeric silicon dioxide sio2 2 has been prepared by reacting o2 with matrix isolated dimeric silicon monoxide si2o2 in dimeric silicon dioxide there are two oxygen atoms bridging between the silicon atoms with an si-o-si angle of 94 and bond length of 164.6 pm and the terminal si-o bond length is 150.2 pm the si-o bond length is 148.3 pm which compares with the length of 161 pm in -quartz the bond energy is estimated at 621.7 kj mol 15 undue weight discuss natural occurrence edit geology edit this section needs expansion you can help by july 2017 silica with the chemical formula sio2 is most commonly found in nature as quartz sio4 which comprises more than 10 by mass of the earth s crust 16 in many parts of the world silica is the major constituent of sand citation needed biology edit even though it is poorly soluble silica occurs in many plants plant materials with high silica phytolith content appear to be of importance to grazing animals from chewing insects to ungulates silica accelerates tooth wear and high levels of silica in plants frequently eaten by herbivores may have developed as a defense mechanism against predation 17 18 silica is also the primary component of rice husk ash which is used for example in filtration and cement manufacturing for well over a billion years silicification in and by cells has been common in the biological world in the modern world it occurs in bacteria single-celled organisms plants and animals invertebrates and vertebrates prominent examples include tests or frustules i e shells of diatoms radiolaria and testate amoebae 6 silica phytoliths in the cells of many plants including equisetaceae practically all grasses and a wide range of dicotyledons the spicules forming the skeleton of many sponges crystalline minerals formed in the physiological environment often show exceptional physical properties e g strength hardness fracture toughness and tend to form hierarchical structures that exhibit microstructural order over a range of scales the minerals are crystallized from an environment that is undersaturated with respect to silicon and under conditions of neutral ph and low temperature 0 40 c formation of the mineral may occur either within the cell wall of an organism such as with phytoliths or outside the cell wall as typically happens with tests clarification needed specific biochemical reactions exist for mineral deposition such reactions include those that involve lipids proteins and carbohydrates it is unclear in what ways silica is important in the nutrition of animals this field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only all the same it certainly does occur in the living body leaving us with the problem that it is hard to create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research this makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects and when its presence is coincidental or even harmful the current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth strength and management of many connective tissues this is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well 19 uses edit structural use edit an estimated 95 of silicon dioxide produced is consumed in the construction industry e g for the production of portland cement 16 silica in the form of sand is used as the main ingredient in sand casting for the manufacture of metallic components in engineering and other applications the high melting point of silica enables it to be used in such applications crystalline silica is used in hydraulic fracturing of formations which contain tight oil and shale gas 20 precursor to glass and silicon edit silica is the primary ingredient in the production of most glass the glass transition temperature of pure sio2 is about 1475 k 21 when molten silicon dioxide sio2 is rapidly cooled it does not crystallize but solidifies as a glass the structural geometry of silicon and oxygen in glass is similar to that in quartz and most other crystalline forms of silicon and oxygen with silicon surrounded by regular tetrahedra of oxygen centers the difference between the glass and crystalline forms arises from the connectivity of the tetrahedral units although there is no long range periodicity in the glassy network ordering remains at length scales well beyond the sio bond length one example of this ordering is the preference to form rings of 6-tetrahedra 22 fumed silica edit fumed silica also known as pyrogenic silica is a very fine particulate or colloidal form of silicon dioxide it is prepared by burning sicl4 in an oxygen-rich hydrogen flame to produce a smoke of sio2 9 sicl 4 2 h 2 o 2 sio 2 4 hcl the majority of optical fibers for telecommunication are also made from silica it is a primary raw material for many ceramics such as earthenware stoneware and porcelain silicon dioxide is used to produce elemental silicon the process involves carbothermic reduction in an electric arc furnace 23 sio 2 2 c si 2 co food and pharmaceutical applications edit silica is a common additive in food production where it is used primarily as a flow agent in powdered foods or to adsorb water in hygroscopic applications it is used as an anti-caking agent in powdered foods such as spices and non-dairy coffee creamer it is the primary component of diatomaceous earth colloidal silica is also used as a wine beer and juice fining agent 16 page needed in pharmaceutical products silica aids powder flow when tablets are formed citation needed personal care edit in cosmetics its useful for its light-diffusing properties 24 and natural absorbency 25 hydrated silica is used in toothpaste as a hard abrasive to remove tooth plaque other edit hydrophobic silica is used as a defoamer component where citation needed in its capacity as a refractory it is useful in fiber form as a high-temperature thermal protection fabric citation needed it is used as a thermal enhancement further explanation needed compound in the ground source heat pump industry citation needed silica is used in the extraction of dna and rna due to its ability to bind to the nucleic acids under the presence of chaotropes citation needed a silica-based aerogel was used in the stardust spacecraft to collect extraterrestrial particles citation needed production edit silicon dioxide is mostly obtained by mining including sand mining and purification of quartz quartz is suitable for many purposes while chemical processing is required to make a purer or otherwise more suitable e g more reactive or fine-grained product citation needed silica fume edit silica fume is obtained as byproduct from hot processes like ferro-silicon production it is less pure than fumed silica and should not be confused with that product the production process particle characteristics and fields of application of fumed silica are all different from those of silica fume precipitated silica edit precipitated silica or amorphous silica is produced by the acidification of solutions of sodium silicate the gelatinous precipitate or silica gel is first washed and then dehydrated to produce colorless microporous silica 9 idealized equation involving a trisilicate and sulfuric acid is shown na 2si 3o 7 h 2so 4 3 sio 2 na 2so 4 h 2o approximately one billion kilograms year 1999 of silica was produced in this manner mainly for use for polymer composites tires and shoe soles 16 on microchips edit thin films of silica grow spontaneously on silicon wafers via thermal oxidation producing a very shallow layer of about 1 nm or 10 of so-called native oxide 26 higher temperatures and alternative environments are used to grow well-controlled layers of silicon dioxide on silicon for example at temperatures between 600 and 1200 c using so-called dry or wet oxidation with o2 si o 2 sio 2 or h2o respectively 27 28 si 2 h 2o sio 2 2 h 2 the depth of the layer of silicon which dioxide replaces is 44 of the depth of the silicon dioxide layer produced 27 the native oxide layer is beneficial in microelectronics where it acts as electric insulator with high chemical stability it can protect the silicon store charge block current and even act as a controlled pathway to limit current flow 29 laboratory or special methods edit from silicate esters edit many routes to silicon dioxide start with silicate esters the best known being tetraethyl orthosilicate teos simply heating teos at 680 730 c gives the dioxide si oc 2h 5 4 sio 2 2 o c 2h 5 2 similarly teos combusts around 400 c si oc 2h 5 4 12 o 2 sio 2 10 h 2o 8 co 2 teos undergoes hydrolysis via the so-called sol-gel process the course of the reaction and nature of the product are affected by catalysts but the idealized equation is 30 si oc 2h 5 4 2 h 2o sio 2 4 hoch 2ch 3 other methods edit being highly stable silicon dioxide arises from many methods conceptually simple but of little practical value combustion of silane gives silicon dioxide this reaction is analogous to the combustion of methane sih 4 2 o 2 sio 2 2 h 2o however the chemical vapor deposition of silicon dioxide onto crystal surface from silane had been used using nitrogen as a carrier gas at 200-500oc 31 chemical reactions edit manufactured silica fume at maximum surface area of 380 m 2 g silica is converted to silicon by reduction with carbon fluorine reacts with silicon dioxide to form sif4 and o2 whereas the other halogen gases cl2 br2 i2 are essentially unreactive 9 silicon dioxide is attacked by hydrofluoric acid hf to produce hexafluorosilicic acid 8 sio 2 6 hf h 2sif 6 2 h 2o hf is used to remove or pattern silicon dioxide in the semiconductor industry silicon dioxide acts as a lux flood acid being able to react with bases under certain conditions as it does not contain any hydrogen it cannot act as a br nsted lowry acid while not soluble in water some strong bases will react with glass and have to be stored in plastic bottles as a result 32 silicon dioxide dissolves in hot concentrated alkali or fused hydroxide as described in this idealized equation 9 sio 2 2 naoh na 2sio 3 h 2o silicon dioxide will neutralise basic metal oxides e g sodium oxide potassium oxide lead ii oxide zinc oxide or mixtures of oxides forming silicates and glasses as the si-o-si bonds in silica are

composed of high purity silica silicon dioxide reacts in heated reflux under dinitrogen with ethylene glycol and an alkali metal base to produce highly reactive pentacoordinate silicates which provide access to a wide variety of new silicon compounds 33 the silicates are essentially insoluble in all polar solvent except methanol silicon dioxide reacts with elemental silicon at high temperatures to produce sio 8 sio 2 si 2 sio water solubility edit the solubility of silicon dioxide in water strongly depends on its crystalline form and is three-four times higher for silica than quartz as a function of temperature it peaks around 340 c 34 this property is used to grow single crystals of quartz in a hydrothermal process where natural quartz is dissolved in superheated water in a pressure vessel that is cooler at the top crystals of 0.5 1 kg can be grown over a period of 1 2 months 8 these crystals are a source of very pure quartz for use in electronic applications 9 health effects edit quartz sand silica as main raw material for commercial glass production silica ingested orally is essentially nontoxic with an ld50 of 5000 mg kg 5 g kg 16 a 2008 study following subjects for 15 years found that higher levels of silica in water appeared to decrease the risk of dementia an increase of 10 milligram-per-day of silica in drinking water was associated with a decreased risk of dementia of 11 35 inhaling finely divided crystalline silica dust can lead to silicosis bronchitis or lung cancer as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates the tissue reducing lung capacities 36 when fine silica particles are inhaled in large enough quantities such as through occupational exposure it increases the risk of systemic autoimmune diseases such as lupus 37 and rheumatoid arthritis compared to expected rates in the general population 38 occupational hazard edit silica is an occupational hazard for people who do sandblasting work with products that contain powdered crystalline silica amorphous silica such as fumed silica may cause irreversible lung damage in some cases but is not associated with development of silicosis children asthmatics of any age those with allergies and the elderly all of whom have reduced lung capacity can be affected in less time 39 crystalline silica is an occupational hazard for those working with stone countertops because the process of cutting and installing the countertops creates large amounts of airborne silica 40 crystalline silica used in hydraulic fracturing presents a health hazard to workers 20 pathophysiology edit in the body crystalline silica particles do not dissolve over clinically relevant periods silica crystals inside the lungs can activate the nlrp3 inflammasome inside macrophages and dendritic cells and thereby result in production of interleukin a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine in the immune system 41 42 43 regulation edit regulations restricting silica exposure with respect to the silicosis hazard specify that they are concerned only with silica which is both crystalline and dust-forming 44 45 46 47 48 49 in 2013 the u s occupational safety and health administration reduced the exposure limit to 50 g per cubic meter of air prior to 2013 it had allowed 100 g m3 and in construction workers even 250 g m3 20 in 2013 osha also required green completion of fracked wells to reduce exposure to crystalline silica besides restricting the limit of exposure 20 crystalline forms edit sio2 more so than almost any material exists in many crystalline forms
