chimborazo is in the cordillera occidental of the andes of central ecuador 150 km 93 mi south-southwest of the capital quito it is a neighbor to 5,018 m high carihuairazo chimborazo s summit rises 2,500 m above the surrounding highlands 3,500 to 4,000 m with a 20 km wide base under clear conditions the summit of chimborazo can be seen from the coastal city guayaquil nearly 140 km away the nearest cities are riobamba 30 km to the southeast ambato 30 km to the northeast and guaranda 25 km to the southwest chimborazo is surrounded by the reserva de produccion faunistica chimborazo which forms a protected ecosystem to preserve the habitat for the andes native camelids of vicu a llama and alpaca chimborazo is at the main end of the ecuadorian volcanic arc north west of the town of riobamba chimborazo is in la avenida de los volcanes the avenue of volcanoes west of the sanancajas mountain chain carihuairazo tungurahua tulabug and el altar are all mountains that neighbor chimborazo the closest mountain peak carihuairazo is 5.8 mi 9.3 km from chimborazo 5 there are many microclimates near chimborazo varying from desert in the arenal to the humid mountains in the abraspungo valley 6 glaciers edit ecuador chimborazo the top of chimborazo is completely covered by glaciers with some north-eastern glacier arms flowing down to 4,600 m its glacier is the source of water for the population of the bolivar and chimborazo provinces of ecuador chimborazo glacier s ice mass has decreased over the past decades which is thought by some to be due to the combined influences of global warming ash covers from recent volcanic activity note 2 of tungurahua and the el ni o phenomenon 8 9 as on other glaciated ecuadorian mountains chimborazo s glacial ice is mined by locals the so-called hieleros from spanish hielo for ice to be sold in the markets of guaranda and riobamba in earlier days the people transported ice for cooling uses down to coastal towns such as babahoyo or vinces 10 elevation edit with an elevation of 6,263 m 20,548 ft note 1 chimborazo is the highest mountain in ecuador and the andes north of peru it is higher than any more northerly summit in the americas farthest point from earth s center edit the summit of mount everest is higher above sea level but the summit of chimborazo is widely reported to be the farthest point on the surface from earth s center 12 13 with huascar n a very close second the summit of the chimborazo is the fixed point on earth that has the utmost distance from the center because of the oblate spheroid shape of the planet earth which is thicker around the equator than measured around the poles note 3 chimborazo is one degree south of the equator and the earth s diameter at the equator is greater than at the latitude of everest 8,848 m 29,029 ft above sea level nearly 27.6 north with sea level also elevated despite being 2,585 m 8,481 ft lower in elevation above sea level it is 6,384.4 km 3,967.1 mi from the earth s center 2,163 m 7,096 ft farther than the summit of everest 6,382.3 km 3,965.8 mi from the earth s center note 4 however by height above sea level chimborazo is not even the highest peak of the andes vicu a one of two wild south american camelids chimborazo seen from riobamba alpacas in front of chimborazo chimborazo from the west geology edit chimborazo is an ice-capped inactive volcano in ecuador chimborazo is a double volcano composed of one volcanic edifice on top of another 14 chimborazo shows four summits whymper veintimilla politecnica and nicolas mart nez the whymper peak is the highest point on the mountain at 6,263 meters the veintimilla peak is about 6,230 m 20,440 ft high the politecnica peak is 5,820 m 19,094 ft high the last peak nicolas mart nez is 5,570 m 18,274 ft high and was named after the father of ecuadorian mountaineering the volcano is categorized as a stratovolcano 14 this type of volcano is characterized as having low slopes at the bottom that gradually get steeper the higher up the mountain 15 chimborazo has a circumference of 78 miles 126 km and a diameter of 30 miles 48 km chimborazo s upper elevations are covered in glaciers that are decreasing in size due to climate change and falling ash from the nearby volcano tungurahua in addition to the glaciers the volcano is covered with craters the volcano is dominantly andesitic to dacitic this means that the lava is blocky or flowing down the sides of the volcano or somewhere in between 16 the peak of chimborazo is the farthest point from the center of the earth this is due to the earth bulging out at the equator and chimborazo being located just one degree south of the equator mount everest is 28 north of the equator thus chimborazo is 2.1 kilometres farther from the earth s center than everest chimborazo is 73.5 metres higher than the highest mountain in north america chimborazo is often associated with the nearby volcano cotopaxi although the two volcanoes have completely different structures volcanism edit chimborazo is a dominantly andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano about 35,000 years ago a collapse of chimborazo produced a debris avalanche with an average thickness of forty meters which underlies the city of riobamba it temporarily dammed the rio chambe causing an ephemeral lake 14 chimborazo then erupted several times during the holocene the last time around 550 ad 150 years 4 the eruptions after the collapse were primarily andesitic or blocky coagulated lava flow these eruptions produced pyroclastic surges that went down as far as 3800 meters altitude 14 there have been at least seven eruptions in the past 10000 years chimborazo is officially considered inactive but studies show that there may be an eruption in the future citation needed the average time between eruptions for chimborazo is 1000 years citation needed and the last eruption was 1400 years ago 1839 black x2f hall map of the mountains plants of america - geographicus - americamts2-black-1839 by alexander von humboldt history edit until the beginning of the 19th century it was thought that chimborazo was the highest mountain on earth measured from sea level and such reputation led to many attempts on its summit during the 17th and 18th centuries in 1746 the volcano was explored by french academicians from the french geodesic mission their mission was to determine the sphericity of the earth their work along with another team in lapland established that the earth was an oblate spheroid rather than a true sphere they did not reach the summit of chimborazo in 1802 during his expedition to south america baron alexander von humboldt accompanied by aim bonpland and the ecuadorian carlos mont far tried to reach the summit from his description of the mountain it seems that before he and his companions had to return suffering from altitude sickness they reached a point at 5,875 m higher than previously attained by any european in recorded history incans had reached much higher altitudes previously see llullaillaco in 1831 jean baptiste boussingault and colonel hall reached a new highest point estimated to be 6,006 m 17 18 other failed attempts to reach the summit followed on 4 january 1880 the english climber edward whymper reached the summit of chimborazo 19 the route that whymper took up the mountain is now known as the whymper route edward whymper and his italian guides louis carrel and jean-antoine carrel were the first europeans to summit a mountain higher than 20,000 feet 6,100 m 20 as there were many critics who doubted that whymper had reached the summit later in the same year he climbed to the summit again choosing a different route pogyos with the ecuadorians david beltr n and francisco campa a 21 saeta flight 232 edit in august 1976 saeta flight 232 carrying 55 passengers and four crew members aboard a vickers viscount from quito to cuenca disappeared en route in february 2003 after almost 27 years 22 the aircraft was found with the bodies of its 59 occupants at 5,400 metres 17,700 ft elevation on chimborazo by ecuadorian climbers on the rarely used eastern route integral 23 etymology edit chimborazo seen from riobamba several theories regarding the origin of the name chimborazo exist in many dialects of quichua or quechua chimba means on the other side as in on the other side of the river or on the opposite bank other dialects pronounce this word chimpa also razu means ice or snow local quichua speakers will say that chimborazo is a hispanicized pronunciation of chimbarazu meaning the snow on the other side 24 another theory suggests it is a combination of the cayapa schingbu for women and the colorado quichua razo for ice snow resulting in women of ice according to another chimbo is j varo for throne of master god resulting in icethrone of god the locals also used to call the mountain urcurazu with the quichua urcu for mountain resulting in mountain of ice 25 in local indigenous mysticism chimborazo represents taita father whereas neighbouring tungurahua is seen as mama hence taita chimborazo and mama tungurahua mountaineering edit sketch of chimborazo huts main summits and routes as ecuador s highest mountain chimborazo is a very popular climb and can be climbed year round with the best seasons being december january and july august routes edit the easiest grade pd and most climbed routes are the normal and the whymper route both are western ridge routes starting at the whymper hut and leading via the ventemilla summit to the main whymper summit there are several other less used and more challenging routes on the other mountains faces and ridges leading to one of chimborazo s summits main whymper ecuador politecnico central n martinez eastern the mountain is contained on the igm instituto geografico militar 1 50000 map chimborazo ct- iv-c1 2 huts edit there are two functioning huts the carrel hut 4,850 m and the nearby whymper hut 5,000 m the carrel hut can be reached by car from riobamba ambato or guaranda on the north-west side there is the now defunct zurita hut 4,900 m which served as base for the pogyos route 25 climbing edit el castillo is the most popular route up the volcano this route is usually climbed december to february and june to september this route involves climbing the west side of the volcano the route starts at whymper hut to a saddle above el castillo from the saddle there is a glacier ridge then you go to the veintemilla summit veintemilla summit is often the turnaround point for climbers there is a 30-minute snow filled basin between veintemilla summit and whymper summit whymper summit is the highest point of the mountain the el castillo route takes around eight to twelve hours to ascend and about three to five hours to descend climbing chimborazo is dangerous due to risk of avalanches the severe weather conditions and the fact that it is covered in glaciers climbing should begin at night in order to reach the summit before sunrise when the snow melts increasing the chance of avalanche and rockfall the climb itself demands skill the climb is often on black ice in which crampons and other high tech climbing equipment are required on november 10 1993 three parties of climbers one ascending and two descending were caught in an avalanche on the steep slopes below the veintimilla summit this avalanche buried ten climbers in a crevasse at 18,700 feet 5,700 m these climbers comprised six french two ecuadorans one swiss and one chilean after the ten climbers were buried in snow it took twenty people and ten days to find their bodies this is considered the worst climbing accident in ecuador to date 20 cultural references edit chimborazo is featured on the ecuadorian coat of arms to represent the beauty and richness of the ecuadorian sierra highlands sim n bol var s poem mi delirio sobre el chimborazo was inspired by the mountain walter j turner s poem romance contains the couplet chimborazo cotopaxi they had stolen my soul away 26 miguel ngel le n s poem canto al chimborazo sing of chimborazo 27 see also edit lists of volcanoes list of volcanoes in ecuador notes edit a b the elevation given here was established by a gps survey in february 2016 the survey was carried out by a team from the french research institute for development working in cooperation with the ecuadorian military geographic institute 11 tungurahua s recent activity period started in 1999 with the most significant eruptions between october and december 1999 and may and july 2006 7 it has been difficult to resolve this issue definitively because of error margins in summit elevations and geoid data application of the formula at earth radius radius at a given geodetic latitude shows that the earth s radius is 520 metres 1,710 ft greater at chimborazo than at huascaran with most recent data showing another 5 metres 16 ft due to local variations in gravity for a total of 525 metres 1,722 ft two heights are given for huascar n - 6,746 m 22,133 ft from the peruvian national geographic institute ign map and 6,768 m 22,205 ft from the austrian alpine club oeav survey map chimbaro is now 6,263 m 20,548 ft thus chimborazo s summit is roughly either 20 metres 66 ft or 40 metres 130 ft further from the earth s center than that of huascaran in this ranking several other andean peaks as well as africa s highest
