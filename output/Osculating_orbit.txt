particular in astrodynamics the osculating orbit of an object in space at a given moment in time is the gravitational kepler orbit i e ellipse or other conic that it would have about its central body if perturbations were not present 1 that is it is the orbit that coincides with the current orbital state vectors position and velocity the word osculate derives from a latin word meaning to kiss its use in this context derives from the fact that at any point in time an object s osculating orbit is precisely tangent to its actual orbit with the tangent point being the object s location and has the same curvature as the orbit would have in the absence of perturbing forces contents 1 kepler elements 2 perturbations 3 parameters 4 see also 5 references 6 external links kepler elements edit an osculating orbit and the object s position upon it can be fully described by the six standard kepler orbital elements osculating elements which are easy to calculate as long as one knows the object s position and velocity relative to the central body the osculating elements would remain constant in the absence of perturbations however real astronomical orbits experience perturbations that cause the osculating elements to evolve sometimes very quickly in cases where general celestial mechanical analyses of the motion have been carried out as they have been for the major planets the moon and other planetary satellites the orbit can be described by a set of mean elements with secular and periodic terms in the case of minor planets a system of proper orbital elements has been devised to enable representation of the most important aspects of their orbits perturbations edit perturbations that cause an object s osculating orbit to change can arise from a non-spherical component to the central body when the central body can be modeled neither with a point mass nor with a spherically symmetrical mass distribution e g when it is an oblate spheroid a third body or multiple other bodies whose gravity perturbs the object s orbit for example the effect of the moon s gravity on objects orbiting earth a relativistic correction a non-gravitational force acting on the body for example force arising from thrust from a rocket engine releasing leaking venting or ablation of a material collisions with other objects atmospheric drag radiation pressure solar wind pressure switch to a non-inertial reference frame e g when a satellite s orbit is described in a reference frame associated with the precessing equator of the planet parameters edit an object s orbital parameters will be different if they are expressed with respect to a non-inertial reference frame for example a frame co-precessing with the primary s equator than if it is expressed with respect to a non-rotating inertial reference frame put in more general terms a perturbed trajectory can be analysed as if assembled of points each of which is contributed by a curve out of a sequence of curves variables parameterising the curves within this family can be called orbital elements typically though not necessarily these curves are chosen as keplerian conics all of which share one focus in most situations it is convenient to set each of these curves tangent to the trajectory at the point of intersection curves that obey this condition and also the further condition that they have the same curvature at the point of tangency as would be produced by the object s gravity towards the central body in the absence of perturbing forces are called osculating while the variables parameterising these curves are called osculating elements in some situations description of orbital motion can be simplified and approximated by choosing orbital elements that are not osculating also in some situations the standard lagrange-type or delaunay-type equations furnish orbital elements that turn out to be non-osculating 2 see also edit kepler orbit eccentricity vector orbital elements contact mathematics
