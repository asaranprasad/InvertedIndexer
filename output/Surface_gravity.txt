gravitational acceleration experienced at its surface the surface gravity may be thought of as the acceleration due to gravity experienced by a hypothetical test particle which is very close to the object s surface and which in order not to disturb the system has negligible mass surface gravity is measured in units of acceleration which in the si system are meters per second squared it may also be expressed as a multiple of the earth s standard surface gravity g 9.80665 m s 1 in astrophysics the surface gravity may be expressed as log g which is obtained by first expressing the gravity in cgs units where the unit of acceleration is centimeters per second squared and then taking the base-10 logarithm 2 therefore the surface gravity of earth could be expressed in cgs units as 980.665 cm s with a base-10 logarithm log g of 2.992 the surface gravity of a white dwarf is very high and of a neutron star even higher the neutron star s compactness gives it a surface gravity of up to 7 1012 m s with typical values of order 1012 m s that is more than 1011 times that of earth one measure of such immense gravity is that neutron stars have an escape velocity of around 100,000 km s about a

gravity the gravitational force exerted by an object is proportional to its mass an object with twice the mass produces twice as much force newtonian gravity also follows an inverse square law so that moving an object twice as far away divides its gravitational force by four and moving it ten times as far away divides it by 100 this is similar to the intensity of light which also follows an inverse square law with relation to distance light becomes less visible generally speaking this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space a large object such as a planet or star will usually be approximately round approaching hydrostatic equilibrium where all points on the surface have the same amount of gravitational potential energy on a small scale higher parts of the terrain are eroded with eroded material deposited in lower parts of the terrain on a large scale the planet or star itself deforms until equilibrium is reached 4 for most celestial objects the result is that the planet or star in question can be treated as a near-perfect sphere when the rotation rate is low however for young massive stars the equatorial azimuthal velocity can be quite high up to 200 km s or more causing a significant amount of equatorial bulge examples of such rapidly rotating stars include achernar altair regulus a and vega the fact that many large celestial objects are approximately spheres makes it easier to calculate their surface gravity the gravitational force outside a spherically symmetric body is the same as if its entire mass were concentrated in the center as was established by sir isaac newton 5 therefore the surface gravity of a planet or star with a given mass will be approximately inversely proportional to the square of its radius and the surface gravity of a planet or star with a given average density will be approximately proportional to its radius for example the recently discovered planet gliese 581 c has at least 5 times the mass of earth but is unlikely to have 5 times its surface gravity if its mass is no more than 5 times that of the earth as is expected 6 and if it is a rocky planet with a large iron core it should have a radius approximately 50 larger than that of earth 7 8 gravity on such a planet s surface would be approximately 2.2 times as strong as on earth if it is an icy or watery planet its radius might be as large as twice the earth s in which case its surface gravity might be no more than 1.25 times as strong as the earth s 8 these proportionalities may be expressed by the formula g m r 2 displaystyle g frac m r 2 where g is the surface gravity of an object expressed as a multiple of the earth s m is its mass expressed as a multiple of the earth s mass 5.976 1024 kg and r its radius expressed as a multiple of the earth s mean radius 6,371 km 9 for instance mars has a mass of 6.4185 1023 kg 0.107 earth masses and a mean radius of 3,390 km 0.532 earth radii 10 the surface gravity of mars is therefore approximately 0.107 0.532 2 0.38 displaystyle frac 0.107 0.532 2 0.38 times that of earth without using the earth as a reference body the surface gravity may also be calculated directly from newton s law of universal gravitation which gives the formula g g m r 2 displaystyle g frac gm r 2 where m is the mass of the object r is its radius and g is the gravitational constant if we let m v denote the mean density of the object we can also write this as g 4 3 g r displaystyle g frac 4 pi 3 g rho r so that for fixed mean density the surface gravity g is proportional to the radius r since gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance a space station 400 km above the earth feels almost the same gravitational force as we do on the earth s surface the reason a space station does not plummet to the ground is not that it is not subject to gravity but that it is in a free-fall orbit non-spherically symmetric objects edit most real astronomical objects are not absolutely spherically symmetric one reason for this is that they are often rotating which means that they are affected by the combined effects of gravitational force and centrifugal force this causes stars and planets to be oblate which means that their surface gravity is smaller at the equator than at the poles this effect was exploited by hal clement in his sf novel mission of gravity dealing with a massive fast-spinning planet where gravity was much higher at the poles than at the equator to the extent that an object s internal distribution of mass differs from a symmetric model we may use the measured surface gravity to deduce things about the object s internal structure this fact has been put to practical use since 1915 1916 when roland e tv s s torsion balance was used to prospect for oil near the city of egbell now gbely slovakia 11 p 1663 12 p 223 in 1924 the torsion balance was used to locate the nash dome oil fields in texas 12 p 223 it is sometimes useful to calculate the surface gravity of simple hypothetical objects which are not found in nature the surface gravity of infinite planes tubes lines hollow shells cones and even more unrealistic structures may be used to provide insights into the behavior of real structures surface gravity of a black hole edit in relativity the newtonian concept of acceleration turns out not to be clear cut for a black hole which must be treated relativistically one cannot define a surface gravity as the acceleration experienced by a test body at the object s surface this is because the acceleration of a test body at the event horizon of a black hole turns out to be infinite in relativity because of this a renormalized value is used that corresponds to the newtonian value in the non-relativistic limit the value used is generally the local proper acceleration which diverges at the event horizon multiplied by the gravitational time dilation factor which goes to zero at the event horizon for the schwarzschild case this value is mathematically well behaved for all non-zero values of r and m when one talks about the surface gravity of a black hole one is defining a notion that behaves analogously to the newtonian surface gravity but is not the same thing in fact the surface gravity of a general black hole is not well defined however one can define the surface gravity for a black hole whose event horizon is a killing horizon the surface gravity displaystyle kappa of a static killing horizon is the acceleration as exerted at infinity needed to keep an object at the horizon mathematically if k a displaystyle k a is a suitably normalized killing vector then the surface gravity is defined by k a a k b k b displaystyle k a nabla a k b kappa k b where the equation is evaluated at the horizon for a static and asymptotically flat spacetime the normalization should be chosen so that k a k a 1 displaystyle k a k a rightarrow -1 as r displaystyle r rightarrow infty and so that 0 displaystyle kappa geq 0 for the schwarzschild solution we take k a displaystyle k a to be the time translation killing vector k a a t displaystyle k a partial a frac partial partial t and more generally for the kerr newman solution we take k a a t displaystyle k a partial a frac partial partial t omega frac partial partial varphi the linear combination of the time translation and axisymmetry killing vectors which is null at the horizon where displaystyle omega is the angular velocity schwarzschild solution edit since k a displaystyle k a is a killing vector k a a k b k b

g-k where g 1 4 m displaystyle g frac 1 4m is the schwarzschild surface gravity and k m 2 displaystyle k m omega 2 is the spring constant of the rotating black hole displaystyle omega is the angular velocity at the event horizon this expression gives a simple hawking temperature of 2 t g k displaystyle 2 pi t g-k 14 kerr newman solution edit the surface gravity for the kerr newman solution is r r

dynamical black holes edit surface gravity for stationary black holes is well defined this is because all stationary black holes have a horizon that is killing 15 recently there has been a shift towards defining the surface gravity of dynamical black holes whose spacetime does not admit a killing vector field 16 several definitions have been proposed over the years by various authors as of current there is no consensus or agreement of which definition if any is correct 17 references edit p 29 ed barry n taylor nist special publication 330 2001 smalley b 13 july 2006 keele university
