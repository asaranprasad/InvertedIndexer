emission lines absorption lines absorption lines for air under indirect illumination with the direct light source not visible so that the gas is not directly between source and detector here fraunhofer lines in sunlight and rayleigh scattering of this sunlight is the source this is the spectrum of a blue sky somewhat close to the horizon pointing east at around 3 or 4 pm i e sun in the west on a clear day a spectral line is a dark or bright line in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum resulting from emission or absorption of light in a narrow frequency range compared with the nearby frequencies spectral lines are often used to identify atoms and molecules these fingerprints can be compared to the previously collected fingerprints of atoms and molecules 1 and are thus used to identify the atomic and molecular components of stars and planets which would otherwise be impossible contents 1 types of line spectra 2 nomenclature 3 line broadening and shift 3.1 broadening

continuous spectrum of an incandescent lamp mid and discrete spectrum lines of a fluorescent lamp bottom spectral lines are the result of interaction between a quantum system usually atoms but sometimes molecules or atomic nuclei and a single photon when a photon has about the right amount of energy to allow a change in the energy state of the system in the case of an atom this is usually an electron changing orbitals the photon is absorbed then it will be spontaneously re-emitted either in the same frequency as the original or in a cascade where the sum of the energies of the photons emitted will be equal to the energy of the one absorbed assuming the system returns to its original state a spectral line may be observed either as an emission line or an absorption line which type of line is observed depends on the type of material and its temperature relative to another emission source an absorption line is produced when photons from a hot broad spectrum source pass through a cold material the intensity of light over a narrow frequency range is reduced due to absorption by the material and re-emission in random directions by contrast a bright emission line is produced when photons from a hot material are detected in the presence of a broad spectrum from a cold source the intensity of light over a narrow frequency range is increased due to emission by the material spectral lines are highly atom-specific and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it typically gas is used several elements were discovered by spectroscopic means such as helium thallium and cerium spectral lines also depend on the physical conditions of the gas so they are widely used to determine the chemical composition of stars and other celestial bodies that cannot be analyzed by other means as well as their physical conditions mechanisms other than atom-photon interaction can produce spectral lines depending on the exact physical interaction with molecules single particles etc the frequency of the involved photons will vary widely and lines can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays nomenclature edit this section needs expansion you can help by october 2008 strong spectral lines in the visible part of the spectrum often have a unique fraunhofer line designation such as k for a line at 393.366 nm emerging from singly ionized ca though some of the fraunhofer lines are blends of multiple lines from several different species in other cases the lines are designated according to the level of ionization by adding a roman numeral to the designation of the chemical element so that ca also has the designation ca ii neutral atoms are denoted with the roman number i singly ionized atoms with ii and so on so that for example fe ix ix roman 9 represents eight times ionized iron more detailed designations usually include the line wavelength and may include a multiplet number for atomic lines or band designation for molecular lines many spectral lines of atomic hydrogen also have designations within their respective series such as the lyman series or balmer series originally all spectral lines were classified into series of principle series sharp series and diffuse series these series exist across atoms of all elements and the rydberg-ritz combination principle is a formula that predicts the pattern of lines to be found in all atoms of the elements for this reason the nist spectral line database contains a column for ritz calculated lines these series were later associated with suborbitals line broadening and shift edit a spectral line extends over a range of frequencies not a single frequency i e it has a nonzero linewidth in addition its center may be shifted from its nominal central wavelength there are several reasons for this broadening and shift these reasons may be divided into two general categories broadening due to local conditions and broadening due to extended conditions broadening due to local conditions is due to effects which hold in a small region around the emitting element usually small enough to assure local thermodynamic equilibrium broadening due to extended conditions may result from changes to the spectral distribution of the radiation as it traverses its path to the observer it also may result from the combining of radiation from a number of regions which are far from each other broadening due to local effects edit natural broadening edit the uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of an excited state due to spontaneous radiative decay or the auger process with the uncertainty of its energy a short lifetime will have a large energy uncertainty and a broad emission this broadening effect results in an unshifted lorentzian profile the natural broadening can be experimentally altered only to the extent that decay rates can be artificially suppressed or enhanced 2 thermal doppler broadening edit the atoms in a gas which are emitting radiation will have a distribution of velocities each photon emitted will be red - or blue -shifted by the doppler effect depending on the velocity of the atom relative to the observer the higher the temperature of the gas the wider the distribution of velocities in the gas since the spectral line is a combination of all of the emitted radiation the higher the temperature of the gas the broader the spectral line emitted from that gas this broadening effect is described by a gaussian profile and there is no associated shift pressure broadening edit the presence of nearby particles will affect the radiation emitted by an individual particle there are two limiting cases by which this occurs impact pressure broadening or collisional broadening the collision of other particles with the emitting particle interrupts the emission process and by shortening the characteristic time for the process increases the uncertainty in the energy emitted as occurs in natural broadening 3 the duration of the collision is much shorter than the lifetime of the emission process this effect depends on both the density and the temperature of the gas the broadening effect is described by a lorentzian profile and there may be an associated shift quasistatic pressure broadening the presence of other particles shifts the energy levels in the emitting particle clarification needed thereby altering the frequency of the emitted radiation the duration of the influence is much longer than the lifetime of the emission process this effect depends on the density of the gas but is rather insensitive to temperature the form of the line profile is determined by the functional form of the perturbing force with respect to distance from the perturbing particle there may also be a shift in the line center the general expression for the lineshape resulting from quasistatic pressure broadening is a 4-parameter generalization of the gaussian distribution known as a stable distribution 4 pressure broadening may also be classified by the nature of the perturbing force as follows linear stark broadening occurs via the linear stark effect which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field of a charged particle at a distance r displaystyle r causing a shift in energy that is linear in the field strength e 1 r 2 displaystyle delta e sim 1 r 2 resonance broadening occurs when the perturbing particle is of the same type as the emitting particle which introduces the possibility of an energy exchange process e 1 r 3 displaystyle delta e sim 1 r 3 quadratic stark broadening occurs via the quadratic stark effect which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field causing a shift in energy that is quadratic in the field strength e 1 r 4 displaystyle delta e sim 1 r 4 van der waals broadening occurs when the emitting particle is being perturbed by van der waals forces for the quasistatic case a van der waals profile note 1 is often useful in describing the profile the energy shift as a function of distance definition needed is given in the wings by e g the lennard-jones potential e 1 r 6 displaystyle delta e sim 1 r 6 inhomogeneous broadening edit inhomogeneous broadening is a general term for broadening because some emitting particles are in a different local environment from others and therefore emit at a different frequency this term is used especially for solids where surfaces grain boundaries and stoichiometry variations can create a variety of local environments for a given atom to occupy in liquids the effects of inhomogeneous broadening is sometimes reduced by a process called motional narrowing broadening due to non-local effects edit certain types of broadening are the result of conditions over a large region of space rather than simply upon conditions that are local to the emitting particle opacity broadening edit electromagnetic radiation emitted at a particular point in space can be reabsorbed as it travels through space this absorption depends on wavelength the line is broadened because the photons at the line center have a greater reabsorption probability than the photons at the line wings indeed the reabsorption near the line center may be so great as to cause a self reversal in which the intensity at the center of the line is less than in the wings this process is also sometimes called self-absorption macroscopic doppler broadening edit radiation emitted by a moving source is subject to doppler shift due to a finite line-of-sight velocity projection if different parts of the emitting body have different velocities along the line of sight the resulting line will be broadened with the line width proportional to the width of the velocity distribution for example radiation emitted from a distant rotating body such as a star will be broadened due to the line-of-sight variations in velocity on opposite sides of the star the greater the rate of rotation the broader the line another example is an imploding plasma shell in a z-pinch radiative broadening edit radiative broadening of the spectral absorption profile occurs because the on-resonance absorption in the center of the profile is saturated at much lower intensities than the off-resonant wings therefore as intensity rises absorption in the wings rises faster than absorption in the center leading to a broadening of the profile radiative broadening occurs even at very low light intensities combined effects edit each of these mechanisms can act in isolation or in combination with others assuming each effect is independent the observed line profile is a convolution of the line profiles of each mechanism for example a combination of the thermal doppler broadening and the impact pressure broadening yields a voigt profile however the different line broadening mechanisms are not always independent for example the collisional effects and the motional doppler shifts can act in a coherent manner resulting under some conditions even in a collisional narrowing known as the dicke effect spectral lines of chemical
