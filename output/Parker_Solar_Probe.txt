probe is a planned nasa robotic spacecraft to probe the outer corona of the sun 5 6 it will approach to within 8.5 solar radii 5.9 million kilometers or 3.67 million miles to the surface photosphere of the sun 7 the project was announced in the fiscal 2009 budget year johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory designed and built the spacecraft which was originally scheduled to launch in 2015 8 the launch date has since been rescheduled to the summer of 2018 2 this was the first time a nasa spacecraft was named after a living person honoring physicist eugene parker 9 contents 1

predecessor solar orbiter project conceived in the 1990s similar in design and objectives the solar probe mission served as one of the centerpieces of the eponymous outer planet solar probe opsp program formulated by nasa the first three missions of the program were planned to be the solar orbiter the pluto and kuiper belt reconnaissance mission pluto kuiper express and the europa orbiter astrobiology mission focused on europa 10 11 following the appointment of sean o keefe as administrator of nasa the entirety of the opsp program was cancelled as part of president george w bush s request for the 2003 united states federal budget 12 administrator o keefe cited a need for a restructuring of nasa and its projects falling in line with the bush administration s wish for nasa to refocus on research and development and addressing management shortcomings 12 the cancellation of the program also resulted in the initial cancellation of new horizons the mission that eventually won the competition to replace pluto kuiper express in the former opsp program 13 that mission which would eventually be launched as the first mission of the new frontiers program a conceptual successor to the opsp program would undergo a lengthy political battle to secure funding for its launch which occurred in 2006 14 plans for the solar probe mission would later manifest as the solar probe plus in the early 2010s 15 in may 2017 the spacecraft was renamed parker solar probe in honor of astrophysicist eugene parker 16 overview edit apparent size of the sun as seen from the orbit of the parker solar probe compared to its apparent size seen from earth plot of voyager 2 s heliocentric velocity against its distance from the sun illustrating the use of gravity assist to accelerate the spacecraft by jupiter saturn and uranus 17 using the same technique but with venus parker solar probe will decelerate to lower its orbit the solar parker probe will be the first spacecraft to fly into the low solar corona it will determine the structure and dynamics of the sun s coronal magnetic field understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles the parker solar probe mission design uses repeated gravity assists at venus to incrementally decrease its orbital perihelion to achieve multiple passes of the sun at approximately 8.5 solar radii or about 6 million km 3.7 million mi 0.040 au 18 the spacecraft s systems are designed to endure the extreme radiation and heat near the sun where the incident solar intensity is approximately 520 times the intensity at earth orbit by the use of a solar shadow-shield the solar shield is 11.4 cm 4.5 in thick and is made of reinforced carbon carbon composite which is designed to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft of about 1,377 c 2,511 f 19 the shield is hexagonal and is mounted at the sun-facing side of the spacecraft the spacecraft systems and scientific instruments are located in the central portion of the shield s shadow where direct radiation from the sun is fully blocked the primary power for the mission will be a dual system of solar panels photovoltaic array a primary photovoltaic array used for the portion of the mission outside 7010373994676750000 0.25 au is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the sun and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach this secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain operating temperature 20 trajectory edit the spacecraft trajectory will include seven venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its elliptical orbit around the sun for a total of 24 orbits 1 the science phase will take place during those 7 years focusing on the periods when the spacecraft is closest to the sun the near sun radiation environment is predicted to cause both spacecraft charging effects radiation damage in materials and electronics and communication interruptions so the orbit will be highly elliptical with short times spent near the sun 21 the trajectory requires high launch energy so the probe will be launched on a delta iv heavy class launch vehicle and an upper stage based on the star-48b solid rocket motor 21 interplanetary gravity assists will provide further deceleration relative to its heliocentric orbit which may result in a heliocentric speed record at perihelion 3 22 as the probe passes around the sun it will achieve a velocity of up to 200 km s 120 mi s which will temporarily make it the fastest manmade object almost three times as fast as the current record holder helios-b 23 24 25 like every object in an orbit due to gravity the spacecraft will accelerate as it nears perihelion then slow down again afterwards until it reaches its aphelion scientific goals edit the goals of the mission are 21 determine the structure and dynamics of the magnetic fields at the sources of solar wind trace the flow of energy that heats the corona and accelerates the solar wind determine what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles explore dusty plasma near the sun and its influence on solar wind and solar energetic particles formation investigations edit in order to achieve these goals the mission will perform five major experiments or investigations 21 electromagnetic fields

are two electrostatic analyzers and a faraday cup the principal investigator is justin kasper at the university of michigan and the smithsonian astrophysical observatory heliospheric origins with

third time at a point earlier in the orbit of venus this encounter shortens its period to half of that of venus or about 112.5 days after two orbits it meets venus a fourth time at about the same place shortening its period to about 102 days after 237 days it meets venus for the fifth time and its period is shortened to about 96 days three-sevenths that of venus it then makes seven orbits while venus makes three the sixth encounter almost two years after the fifth brings its period down to 92 days two-fifths that of venus after five more orbits two orbits of venus it meets venus for the seventh and last time decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach close to the sun 27 see also edit advanced composition explorer ace launched 1997 still operational as of
