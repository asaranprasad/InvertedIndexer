neptune s orbit lie the kuiper belt and scattered disc which are populations of trans-neptunian objects composed mostly of ices and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids within these populations are several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity 10 such objects are categorized as dwarf planets identified dwarf planets include the asteroid ceres and the trans-neptunian objects pluto and eris e in addition to these two regions various other small-body populations including comets centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds freely travel between regions six of the planets at least four of the dwarf planets and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites f usually termed moons after the moon each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects the solar wind a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the sun creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere the heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc the oort cloud which is thought to be the source for long-period comets may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere the solar system is

notes 15 references 16 external links discovery and exploration andreas cellarius s illustration of the copernican system from the harmonia macrocosmica 1660 for most of history humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the solar system most people up to the late middle ages renaissance believed earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky although the greek philosopher aristarchus of samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos nicolaus copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system 11 12 in the 17th century galileo galilei johannes kepler and isaac newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that earth moves around the sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that govern earth the invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena such as mountains craters seasonal meteorological phenomena such as clouds dust storms and ice caps on the other planets structure and composition the principal component of the solar system is the sun a g2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86 of the system s known mass and dominates it gravitationally 13 the sun s four largest orbiting bodies the giant planets account for 99 of the remaining mass with jupiter and saturn together comprising more than 90 the remaining objects of the solar system including the four terrestrial planets the dwarf planets moons asteroids and comets together comprise less than 0.002 of the solar system s total mass g most large objects in orbit around the sun lie near the plane of earth s orbit known as the ecliptic the planets are very close to the ecliptic whereas comets and kuiper belt objects are frequently at significantly greater angles to it 17 18 all the planets and most other objects orbit the sun in the same direction that the sun is rotating counter-clockwise as viewed from above earth s north pole 19 there are exceptions such as halley s comet the overall structure of the charted regions of the solar system consists of the sun four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids and four giant planets surrounded by the kuiper belt of mostly icy objects astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions the inner solar system includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt the outer solar system is beyond the asteroids including the four giant planets 20 since the discovery of the kuiper belt the outermost parts of the solar system are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond neptune 21 the eight planets of the solar system by decreasing size are jupiter saturn uranus neptune earth venus mars and mercury most of the planets in the solar system have secondary systems of their own being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites or moons two of which titan and ganymede are larger than the planet mercury and in the case of the four giant planets by planetary rings thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison most of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation with one face permanently turned toward their parent all planets of the solar system lie very close to the ecliptic the closer they are to the sun the faster they travel inner planets on the left all planets except neptune on the right kepler s laws of planetary motion describe the orbits of objects about the sun following kepler s laws each object travels along an ellipse with the sun at one focus objects closer to the sun with smaller semi-major axes travel more quickly because they are more affected by the sun s gravity on an elliptical orbit a body s distance from the sun varies over the course of its year a body s closest approach to the sun is called its perihelion whereas its most distant point from the sun is called its aphelion the orbits of the planets are nearly circular but many comets asteroids and kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits the positions of the bodies in the solar system can be predicted using numerical models although the sun dominates the system by mass it accounts for only about 2 of the angular momentum 22 23 the planets dominated by jupiter account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass orbit and distance from the sun with a possibly significant contribution from comets 22 the sun which comprises nearly all the matter in the solar system is composed of roughly 98 hydrogen and helium 24 jupiter and saturn which comprise nearly all the remaining matter are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium 25 26 a composition gradient exists in the solar system created by heat and light pressure from the sun those objects closer to the sun which are more affected by heat and light pressure are composed of elements with high melting points objects farther from the sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points 27 the boundary in the solar system beyond which those volatile substances could condense is known as the frost line and it lies at roughly 5 au from the sun 5 the objects of the inner solar system are composed mostly of rock 28 the collective name for compounds with high melting points such as silicates iron or nickel that remained solid under almost all conditions in the protoplanetary nebula 29 jupiter and saturn are composed mainly of gases the astronomical term for materials with extremely low melting points and high vapour pressure such as hydrogen helium and neon which were always in the gaseous phase in the nebula 29 ices like water methane ammonia hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide 28 have melting points up to a few hundred kelvins 29 they can be found as ices liquids or gases in various places in the solar system whereas in the nebula they were either in the solid or gaseous phase 29 icy substances comprise the majority of the satellites of the giant planets as well as most of uranus and neptune the so-called ice giants and the numerous small objects that lie beyond neptune s orbit 28 30 together gases and ices are referred to as volatiles 31 distances and scales the distance from earth to the sun is 1 astronomical unit 150,000,000 km or au for comparison the radius of the sun is 0.0047 au 700,000 km thus the sun occupies 0.00001 10 5 of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of earth s orbit whereas earth s volume is roughly one millionth 10 6 that of the sun jupiter the largest planet is 5.2 astronomical units 780,000,000 km from the sun and has a radius of 71,000 km 0.00047 au whereas the most distant planet neptune is 30 au 4.5 109 km from the sun with a few exceptions the farther a planet or belt is from the sun the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the sun for example venus is approximately 0.33 au farther out from the sun than mercury whereas saturn is 4.3 au out from jupiter and neptune lies 10.5 au out from uranus attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances for example the titius bode law 32 but no such theory has been accepted the images at the beginning of this section show the orbits of the various constituents of the solar system on different scales some solar system models attempt to convey the relative scales involved in the solar system on human terms some are small in scale and may be mechanical called orreries whereas others extend across cities or regional areas 33 the largest such scale model the sweden solar system uses the 110-metre 361 ft ericsson globe in stockholm as its substitute sun and following the scale jupiter is a 7.5-metre 25-foot sphere at arlanda international airport 40 km 25 mi away whereas the farthest current object sedna is a 10 cm 4 in sphere in lule 912 km 567 mi away 34 35 if the sun neptune distance is scaled to 100 metres then the sun would be about 3 cm in diameter roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3 mm and earth s diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea 0.3 mm at this scale 36 the solar system distances are to scale objects are not distances of selected bodies of the solar system from the sun the left and right edges of each bar correspond to the perihelion and aphelion of the body respectively hence long bars denote high orbital eccentricity the radius of the sun is 0.7 million km and the radius of jupiter the largest planet is 0.07 million km both too small to resolve on this image formation and evolution the solar system formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud h this initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars 38 as is typical of molecular clouds this one consisted mostly of hydrogen with some helium and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars as the region that would become the solar system known as the pre-solar nebula 39 collapsed conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster the centre where most of the mass collected became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc 38 as the contracting nebula rotated faster it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 au 38 and a hot dense protostar at the centre 40 41 the planets formed by accretion from this disc 42 in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other coalescing to form ever larger bodies hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early solar system but they either merged or were destroyed leaving the planets dwarf planets and leftover minor bodies artist s concept of the early solar system due to their higher boiling points only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner solar system close to the sun and these would eventually form the rocky planets of mercury venus earth and mars because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula the terrestrial planets could not grow very large the giant planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune formed further out beyond the frost line the point between the orbits of mars and jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid the ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium the lightest and most abundant elements leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt kuiper belt and oort cloud the nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions within 50 million years the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion 43 the temperature reaction rate pressure and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity at this point the sun became a main-sequence star 44 the main-sequence phase from beginning to end will last about 10 billion years for the sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the sun s pre-remnant life combined 45 solar wind from the sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space ending the planetary formation process the sun is growing brighter early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70 that of what it is today 46 the solar system will remain roughly as we know it today until the hydrogen in the core of the sun has been entirely converted to helium which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now this will mark the end of the sun s main-sequence life at this time the core of the sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium and the energy output will be much greater than at present the outer layers of the sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter and the sun will become a red giant because of its vastly increased surface area the surface of the sun will be considerably cooler 2,600 k at its coolest than it is on the main sequence 45 the expanding sun is expected to vaporize mercury and render earth uninhabitable eventually the core will be hot enough for helium fusion the sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core the sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle its outer layers will move away into space leaving a white dwarf an extraordinarily dense object half the original mass of the sun but only the size of earth 47 the ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula returning some of the material that formed the sun but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon to the interstellar medium sun size comparison of the sun and the planets the sun is the solar system s star and by far its most massive component its large mass 332,900 earth masses 48 produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium making it a main-sequence star 49 this releases an enormous amount of energy mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light 50 the sun is a g2-type main-sequence star hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous the sun s temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars stars brighter and hotter than the sun are rare whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars known as red dwarfs make up 85 of the stars in the milky way 51 52 the sun is a population i star it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium metals in astronomical parlance than the older population ii stars 53 elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars so the first generation of stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with these atoms the oldest stars contain few metals whereas stars born later have more this high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the sun s development of a planetary system because the planets form from the accretion of metals 54 interplanetary medium the heliospheric current sheet the vast majority of the solar system consists of a near-vacuum known as the interplanetary medium along with light the sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles a plasma known as the solar wind this stream of particles spreads outwards at roughly 1.5 million kilometres per hour 55 creating a tenuous atmosphere that permeates the interplanetary medium out to at least 100 au see heliosphere 56 activity on the sun s surface such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections disturb the heliosphere creating space weather and causing geomagnetic storms 57 the largest structure within the heliosphere is the heliospheric current sheet a spiral form created by the actions of the sun s rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium 58 59 earth s magnetic field stops its atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind 60 venus and mars do not have magnetic fields and as a result the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space 61 coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material from the surface of the sun the interaction of this magnetic field and material with earth s magnetic field funnels charged particles into earth s upper atmosphere where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles the heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields for those planets that have them partially shield the solar system from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays the density of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium and the strength of the sun s magnetic field change on very long timescales so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the solar system varies though by how much is unknown 62 the interplanetary medium is home to at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust the first the zodiacal dust cloud lies in the inner solar system and causes the zodiacal light it was likely formed by collisions within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets 63 the second dust cloud extends from about 10 au to about 40 au and was probably created by similar collisions within the kuiper belt 64 65 inner solar system the inner solar system is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt 66 composed mainly of silicates and metals the objects of the inner solar system are relatively close to the sun the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of jupiter and saturn this region is also within the frost line which is a little less than 5 au about 700 million km from the sun 67 inner planets the inner planets from left to right earth mars venus and mercury sizes to scale the four terrestrial or inner planets have dense rocky compositions few or no moons and no ring systems they are composed largely of refractory minerals such as the silicates which form their crusts and mantles and metals such as iron and nickel which form their cores three of the four inner planets venus earth and mars have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather all have impact craters and tectonic surface features such as rift valleys and volcanoes the term inner planet should not be confused with inferior planet which designates those planets that are closer to the sun than earth is i e mercury and venus mercury mercury 0.4 au from the sun is the closest planet to the sun and the smallest planet in the solar system 0.055 earth masses mercury has no natural satellites besides impact craters its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history 68 mercury s very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind 69 its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young sun s energy 70 71 venus venus 0.7 au from the sun is close in size to earth 0.815 earth masses and like earth has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core a substantial atmosphere and evidence of internal geological activity it is much drier than earth and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense venus has no natural satellites it is the hottest planet with surface temperatures over 400 c 752 f most likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 72 no definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on venus but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions 73 earth earth 1 au from the sun is the largest and densest of the inner planets the only one known to have current geological activity and the only place where life is known to exist 74 its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed earth s atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21 free oxygen 75 it has one natural satellite the moon the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the solar system mars mars 1.5 au from the sun is smaller than earth and venus 0.107 earth masses it has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars roughly 0.6 of that of earth 76 its surface peppered with vast volcanoes such as olympus mons and rift valleys such as valles marineris shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago 77 its red colour comes from iron oxide rust in its soil 78 mars has two tiny natural satellites deimos and phobos thought to be captured asteroids 79 asteroid belt the donut-shaped asteroid belt is located between the orbits of mars and jupiter sun jupiter trojans planetary orbit asteroid belt hilda asteroids neos selection asteroids except for the largest ceres are classified as small solar system bodies e and are composed mainly of refractory rocky and metallic minerals with some ice 80 81 they range from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in size asteroids smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids grain-sized depending on different somewhat arbitrary definitions the asteroid belt occupies the orbit between mars and jupiter between 2.3 and 3.3 au from the sun it is thought to be remnants from the solar system s formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of jupiter 82 the asteroid belt contains tens of thousands possibly millions of objects over one kilometre in diameter 83 despite this the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of earth 16 the asteroid belt is very sparsely populated spacecraft routinely pass through without incident ceres ceres - map of gravity fields red is high blue low ceres 2.77 au is the largest asteroid a protoplanet and a dwarf planet e it has a diameter of slightly under 1,000 km and a mass large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801 and was reclassified to asteroid in the 1850s as further observations revealed additional asteroids 84 it was classified as a dwarf planet in 2006 when the definition of a planet was created asteroid groups asteroids in the asteroid belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids they are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons sometimes being almost as large as their partners the asteroid belt also contains main-belt comets which may have been the source of earth s water 85 jupiter trojans are located in either of jupiter s l4 or l5 points gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing a planet in its orbit the term trojan is also used for small bodies in any other planetary or satellite lagrange point hilda asteroids are in a 2 3 resonance with jupiter that is they go around the sun three times for every two jupiter orbits 86 the inner solar system also contains near-earth asteroids many of which cross the orbits of the inner planets 87 some of them are potentially hazardous objects outer solar system the outer region of the solar system is home to the giant planets and their large moons the centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region due to their greater distance from the sun the solid objects in the outer solar system contain a higher proportion of volatiles such as water ammonia and methane than those of the inner solar system because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid outer planets from top to bottom neptune uranus saturn and jupiter montage with approximate colour and relative size the four outer planets or giant planets sometimes called jovian planets collectively make up 99 of the mass known to orbit the sun g jupiter and saturn are together more than 400 times the mass of earth and consist overwhelmingly of hydrogen and helium uranus and neptune are far less massive 20 earth masses each and are composed primarily of ices for these reasons some astronomers suggest they belong in their own category ice giants 88 all four giant planets have rings although only saturn s ring system is easily observed from earth the term superior planet designates planets outside earth s orbit and thus includes both the outer planets and mars jupiter jupiter 5.2 au at 318 earth masses is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together it is composed largely of hydrogen and helium jupiter s strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere such as cloud bands and the great red spot jupiter has 69 known satellites the four largest ganymede callisto io and europa show similarities to the terrestrial planets such as volcanism and internal heating 89 ganymede the largest satellite in the solar system is larger than mercury saturn saturn 9.5 au distinguished by its extensive ring system has several similarities to jupiter such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere although saturn has 60 of jupiter s volume it is less than a third as massive at 95 earth masses saturn is the only planet of the solar system that is less dense than water 90 the rings of saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles saturn has 62 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice two of these titan and enceladus show signs of geological activity 91 titan the second-largest moon in the solar system is larger than mercury and the only satellite in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere uranus uranus 19.2 au at 14 earth masses is the lightest of the outer planets uniquely among the planets it orbits the sun on its side its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic it has a much colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space 92 uranus has 27 known satellites the largest ones being titania oberon umbriel ariel and miranda neptune neptune 30.1 au though slightly smaller than uranus is more massive equivalent to 17 earths and hence more dense it radiates more internal heat but not as much as jupiter or saturn 93 neptune has 14 known satellites the largest triton is geologically active with geysers of liquid nitrogen 94 triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets termed neptune trojans that are in 1 1 resonance with it centaurs the centaurs are icy comet-like bodies whose orbits have semi-major axes greater than jupiter s 5.5 au and less than neptune s 30 au the largest known centaur 10199 chariklo has a diameter of about 250 km 95 the first centaur discovered 2060 chiron has also been classified as comet 95p because it develops a coma just as comets do when they approach the sun 96 comets hale bopp seen in 1997 comets are small solar system bodies e typically only a few kilometres across composed largely of volatile ices they have highly eccentric orbits generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond pluto when a comet enters the inner solar system its proximity to the sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise creating a coma a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye short-period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years long-period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years short-period comets are thought to originate in the kuiper belt whereas long-period comets such as hale bopp are thought to originate in the oort cloud many comet groups such as the kreutz sungrazers formed from the breakup of a single parent 97 some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the solar system but determining their precise orbits is difficult 98 old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids 99 trans-neptunian region beyond the orbit of neptune lies the area of the trans-neptunian region with the doughnut-shaped kuiper belt home of pluto and several other dwarf planets and an overlapping disc of scattered objects which is tilted toward the plane of the solar system and reaches much further out than the kuiper belt the entire region is still largely unexplored it appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worlds the largest having a diameter only a fifth that of earth and a mass far smaller than that of the moon composed mainly of rock and ice this region is sometimes described as the third zone of the solar system enclosing the inner and the outer solar system 100 kuiper belt known objects in the kuiper belt sun jupiter trojans giant planets kuiper belt scattered disc neptune trojans size comparison of some large tnos with earth pluto and its moons eris makemake haumea sedna 2007 or10 quaoar and orcus the kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice 101 it extends between 30 and 50 au from the sun though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets it is composed mainly of small solar system bodies many of the larger kuiper belt objects such as quaoar varuna and orcus may prove to be dwarf planets with further data there are estimated to be over 100,000 kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50 km but the total mass of the kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of earth 15 many kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites 102 and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic 103 the kuiper belt can be roughly divided into the classical belt and the resonances 101 resonances are orbits linked to that of neptune e g twice for every three neptune orbits or once for every two the first resonance begins within the orbit of neptune itself the classical belt consists of objects having no resonance with neptune and extends from roughly 39.4 au to 47.7 au 104 members of the classical kuiper belt are classified as cubewanos after the first of their kind to be discovered 15760 albion which previously had the provisional designation 1992 qb1 and are still in near primordial low-eccentricity orbits 105 pluto and charon the dwarf planet pluto 39 au average is the largest known object in the kuiper belt when discovered in 1930 it was considered to be the ninth planet this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7 au from the sun at perihelion within the orbit of neptune to 49.5 au at aphelion pluto has a 3 2 resonance with neptune meaning that pluto orbits twice round the sun for every three neptunian orbits kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos 106 charon the largest of pluto s moons is sometimes described as part of a binary system with pluto as the two bodies orbit a barycentre of gravity above their surfaces i e they appear to orbit each other beyond charon four much smaller moons styx nix kerberos and hydra orbit within the system makemake and haumea makemake 45.79 au average although smaller than pluto is the largest known object in the classical kuiper belt that is a kuiper belt object not in a confirmed resonance with neptune makemake is the brightest object in the kuiper belt after pluto it was named and designated a dwarf planet in 2008 7 its orbit is far more inclined than pluto s at 29 107 haumea 43.13 au average is in an orbit similar to makemake except that it is in a 7 12 orbital resonance with neptune 108 it is about the same size as makemake and has two natural satellites a rapid 3.9-hour rotation gives it a flattened and elongated shape it was named and designated a dwarf planet in 2008 109 scattered disc the scattered disc which overlaps the kuiper belt but extends much further outwards is thought to be the source of short-period comets scattered-disc objects are thought to have been ejected into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of neptune s early outward migration most scattered disc objects sdos have perihelia within the kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it some more than 150 au from the sun sdos orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane and are often almost perpendicular to it some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the kuiper belt and describe scattered disc objects as scattered kuiper belt objects 110 some astronomers also classify centaurs as inward-scattered kuiper belt objects along with the outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc 111 eris eris 68 au average is the largest known scattered disc object and caused a debate about what constitutes a planet because it is 25 more massive than pluto 112 and about the same diameter it is the most massive of the known dwarf planets it has one known moon dysnomia like pluto its orbit is highly eccentric with a perihelion of 38.2 au roughly pluto s distance from the sun and an aphelion of 97.6 au and steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane farthest regions from the sun to the nearest star the solar system on a logarithmic scale in astronomical units au the point at which the solar system ends and interstellar space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces the solar wind and the sun s gravity the limit of the solar wind s influence is roughly four times pluto s distance from the sun this heliopause the outer boundary of the heliosphere is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium 56 the sun s hill sphere the effective range of its gravitational dominance is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized oort cloud 113 heliosphere the bubble-like heliosphere with its various transitional regions moving through the interstellar medium the heliosphere is a stellar-wind bubble a region of space dominated by the sun which radiates at roughly 400 km s its solar wind a stream of charged particles until it collides with the wind of the interstellar medium the collision occurs at the termination shock which is roughly 80 100 au from the sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200 au from the sun downwind 114 here the wind slows dramatically condenses and becomes more turbulent 114 forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath this structure is thought to look and behave very much like a comet s tail extending outward for a further 40 au on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind evidence from cassini and interstellar boundary explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field 115 the outer boundary of the heliosphere the heliopause is the point at which the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space 56 voyager 1 and voyager 2 are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath at 94 and 84 au from the sun respectively 116 117 voyager 1 is reported to have crossed the heliopause in august 2012 118 the shape and form of the outer edge of the heliosphere is likely affected by the fluid dynamics of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as solar magnetic fields prevailing to the south e g it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending 9 au farther than the southern hemisphere 114 beyond the heliopause at around 230 au lies the bow shock a plasma wake left by the sun as it travels through the milky way 119 zooming out the solar system inner solar system and jupiter outer solar system and pluto orbit of sedna detached object inner part of the oort cloud due to a lack of data conditions in local interstellar space are not known for certain it is expected that nasa s voyager spacecraft as they pass the heliopause will transmit valuable data on radiation levels and solar wind to earth 120 how well the heliosphere shields the solar system from cosmic rays is poorly understood a nasa-funded team has developed a concept of a vision mission dedicated to sending a probe to the heliosphere 121 122 detached objects 90377 sedna 520 au average is a large reddish object with a gigantic highly elliptical orbit that takes it from about 76 au at perihelion to 940 au at aphelion and takes 11,400 years to complete mike brown who discovered the object in 2003 asserts that it cannot be part of the scattered disc or the kuiper belt because its perihelion is too distant to have been affected by neptune s migration he and other astronomers consider it to be the first in an entirely new population sometimes termed distant detached objects ddos which also may include the object 2000 cr105 which has a perihelion of 45 au an aphelion of 415 au and an orbital period of 3,420 years 123 brown terms this population the inner oort cloud because it may have formed through a similar process although it is far closer to the sun 124 sedna is very likely a dwarf planet though its shape has yet to be determined the second unequivocally detached object with a perihelion farther than sedna s at roughly 81 au is 2012 vp113 discovered in 2012 its aphelion is only half that of sedna s at 400 500 au 125 126 oort cloud schematic of the hypothetical oort cloud with a spherical outer cloud and a disc-shaped inner cloud the oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical cloud of up to a trillion icy objects that is thought to be the source for all long-period comets and to surround the solar system at roughly 50,000 au around 1 light-year ly and possibly to as far as 100,000 au 1.87 ly it is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner solar system by gravitational interactions with the outer planets oort cloud objects move very slowly and can be perturbed by infrequent events such as collisions the gravitational effects of a passing star or the galactic tide the tidal force exerted by the milky way 127 128 boundaries much of the solar system is still unknown the sun s gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light years 125,000 au lower estimates for the radius of the oort cloud by contrast do not place it farther than 50,000 au 129 despite discoveries such as sedna the region between the kuiper belt and the oort cloud an area tens of thousands of au in radius is still virtually unmapped there are also ongoing studies of the region between mercury and the sun 130 objects may yet be discovered in the solar system s uncharted regions currently the furthest known objects such as comet west have aphelia around 70,000 au from the sun but as the oort cloud becomes better known this may change galactic context diagram of the milky way with the position of the solar system marked by a yellow arrow the solar system is located in the milky way a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years containing about 100 billion stars 131 the sun resides in one of the milky way s outer spiral arms known as the orion cygnus arm or local spur 132 the sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the galactic centre 133 and its speed within the milky way is about 220 km s so that it completes one revolution every 225 250 million years this revolution is known as the solar system s galactic year 134 the solar apex the direction of the sun s path through interstellar space is near the constellation hercules in the direction of the current location of the bright star vega 135 the plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60 to the galactic plane i the solar system s location in the milky way is a factor in the evolutionary history of life on earth its orbit is close to circular and orbits near the sun are at roughly the same speed as that of the spiral arms 137 138 therefore the sun passes through arms only rarely because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae gravitational instabilities and radiation that could disrupt the solar system this has given earth long periods of stability for life to evolve 137 the solar system also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre near the centre gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the oort cloud and send many comets into the inner solar system producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on earth the intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life 137 even at the solar system s current location some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the sun as radioactive dust grains and larger comet-like bodies 139 neighbourhood beyond the heliosphere is the interstellar medium consisting of various clouds of gases the solar system currently moves through the local interstellar cloud the solar system is in the local interstellar cloud or local fluff it is thought to be near the neighbouring g-cloud but it is not known if the solar system is embedded in the local interstellar cloud or if it is in the region where the local interstellar cloud and g-cloud are interacting 140 141 the local interstellar cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the local bubble an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years ly across the bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae 142 there are relatively few stars within ten light-years of the sun the closest is the triple star system alpha centauri which is about 4.4 light-years away alpha centauri a and b are a closely tied pair of sun-like stars whereas the small red dwarf proxima centauri orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-year in 2016 a potentially habitable exoplanet was confirmed to be orbiting proxima centauri called proxima centauri b the closest confirmed exoplanet to the sun 143 the stars next closest to the sun are the red dwarfs barnard s star at 5.9 ly wolf 359 7.8 ly and lalande 21185 8.3 ly the largest nearby star is sirius a bright main-sequence star roughly 8.6 light-years away and roughly twice the sun s mass and that is orbited by a white dwarf sirius b the nearest brown dwarfs are the binary luhman 16 system at 6.6 light-years other systems within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system luyten 726-8 8.7 ly and the solitary red dwarf ross 154 9.7 ly 144 the closest solitary sun-like star to the solar system is tau ceti at 11.9 light-years it has roughly 80 of the sun s mass but only 60 of its luminosity 145 the closest known free-floating planetary-mass object to the sun is wise 0855 0714 146 an object with a mass less than 10 jupiter masses roughly 7 light-years away a diagram of earth s location in the observable universe click here for an alternate image comparison with extrasolar systems compared to other planetary systems the solar system stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of mercury 147 148 the known solar system also lacks super-earths planet nine could be a super-earth beyond the known solar system 147 uncommonly it has only small rocky planets and large gas giants elsewhere planets of intermediate size are typical both rocky and gas so there is no gap as seen between the size of earth and of neptune with a radius 3.8 times as large also these super-earths have closer orbits than mercury 147 this led to hypothesis that all planetary systems start with many close-in planets and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes consolidation of mass into few larger planets but in case of the solar system the collisions caused their destruction and ejection 149 150 the orbits of solar system planets are nearly circular compared to other systems they have smaller orbital eccentricity 147 although there are attempts to explain it partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets the exact causes remain undetermined 147 151 visual summary this section is a sampling of solar system bodies selected for size and quality of imagery and sorted by volume some omitted objects

is commonly rendered in lower case solar system as for example in the oxford english dictionary and the natural satellites moons orbiting the solar system s planets are an example of the latter historically several other bodies were once considered planets including from its discovery in 1930 until 2006 pluto see former planets the two moons larger than mercury are ganymede which orbits jupiter and titan which orbits saturn although bigger than mercury both moons have less than half the mass of mercury a b c d e according to iau definitions objects orbiting the sun are classified dynamically and physically into three categories planets dwarf planets and small solar system bodies a planet is any body orbiting the sun whose mass is sufficient for gravity to have pulled it into a near- spherical shape and that has cleared its immediate neighbourhood of all smaller objects by this definition the solar system has eight planets mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune because it has not cleared its neighbourhood of other kuiper belt objects pluto does not fit this definition 6 a dwarf planet is a body orbiting the sun that is massive enough to be made near-spherical by its own gravity but that has not cleared planetesimals from its neighbourhood and is also not a satellite 6 pluto is a dwarf planet and the iau has recognized four other dwarf planets in the solar system ceres haumea makemake and eris 7 other objects commonly but not officially treated as dwarf planets include 2007 or10 sedna orcus and quaoar 8 in a reference to pluto other dwarf planets orbiting in the trans-neptunian region are sometimes called plutoids 9 the remaining objects orbiting the sun are known as small solar system bodies 6 see list of natural satellites of the solar system for the full list of natural satellites of the eight planets and first five dwarf planets a b the mass of the solar system excluding the sun jupiter and saturn can be determined by adding together all the calculated masses for its largest objects and using rough calculations for the masses of the oort cloud estimated at roughly 3 earth masses 14 the kuiper belt estimated at roughly 0.1 earth mass 15 and the asteroid belt estimated to be 0.0005 earth mass 16 for a total rounded upwards of 37 earth masses or 8.1 of the mass in orbit around the sun with the combined masses of uranus and neptune 31 earth masses subtracted the remaining 6 earth masses of material comprise 1.3 of the total orbiting mass the date is based on the oldest inclusions found to date in meteorites
