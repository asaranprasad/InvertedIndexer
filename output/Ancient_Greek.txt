in ancient greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century bc to the 6th century ad it is often roughly divided into the archaic period 9th to 6th centuries bc classical period 5th and 4th centuries bc and hellenistic period koine greek 3rd century bc to the 4th century ad it is antedated in the second millennium bc by mycenaean greek and succeeded by medieval greek the language of the hellenistic phase is known as koine common koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own although in its earliest form it closely resembled attic greek and in its latest form it approaches medieval greek prior to the koine period greek of the classic and earlier periods included several regional dialects ancient greek was the language of homer and of fifth-century athenian historians playwrights and philosophers it has contributed many words to english vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the western world since the

attic and ionic aeolic arcadocypriot and doric many of them with several subdivisions some dialects are found in standardized literary forms used in literature while others are attested only in inscriptions there are also several historical forms homeric greek is a literary form of archaic greek derived primarily from ionic and aeolic used in the epic poems the iliad and odyssey and in later poems by other authors homeric greek had significant differences in grammar and pronunciation from classical attic and other classical-era dialects history edit ancient greek language the origins early form and development of the hellenic language family are not well understood because of a lack of contemporaneous evidence several theories exist about what hellenic dialect groups may have existed between the divergence of early greek-like speech from the common proto-indo-european language and the classical period they have the same general outline but differ in some of the detail the only attested dialect from this period 2 is mycenaean greek but its relationship to the historical dialects and the historical circumstances of the times imply that the overall groups already existed in some form scholars assume that major ancient greek period dialect groups developed not later than 1120 bc at the time of the dorian invasion s and that their first appearances as precise alphabetic writing began in the 8th century bc the invasion would not be dorian unless the invaders had some cultural relationship to the historical dorians the invasion is known to have displaced population to the later attic-ionic regions who regarded themselves as descendants of the population displaced by or contending with the dorians the greeks of this period believed there were three major divisions of all greek people dorians aeolians and ionians including athenians each with their own defining and distinctive dialects allowing for their oversight of arcadian an obscure mountain dialect and cypriot far from the center of greek scholarship this division of people and language is quite similar to the results of modern archaeological-linguistic investigation one standard formulation for the dialects is 3 distribution of greek dialects in greece in the classical period 4 western group doric proper northwest doric achaean doric central group aeolic arcado-cypriot eastern group attic ionic west group northwest greek doric aeolic group aegean asiatic aeolic thessalian boeotian ionic-attic group attica euboea and colonies in italy cyclades asiatic ionia arcadocypriot greek arcadian cypriot west vs non-west greek is the strongest marked and earliest division with non-west in subsets of ionic-attic or attic-ionic and aeolic vs arcadocypriot or aeolic and arcado-cypriot vs ionic-attic often non-west is called east greek arcadocypriot apparently descended more closely from the mycenaean greek of the bronze age boeotian had come under a strong northwest greek influence and can in some respects be considered a transitional dialect thessalian likewise had come under northwest greek influence though to a lesser degree pamphylian greek spoken in a small area on the southwestern coast of anatolia and little preserved in inscriptions may be either a fifth major dialect group or it is mycenaean greek overlaid by doric with a non-greek native influence most of the dialect sub-groups listed above had further subdivisions generally equivalent to a city-state and its surrounding territory or to an island doric notably had several intermediate divisions as well into island doric including cretan doric southern peloponnesus doric including laconian the dialect of sparta and northern peloponnesus doric including corinthian the lesbian dialect was aeolic greek all the groups were represented by colonies beyond greece proper as well and these colonies generally developed local characteristics often under the influence of settlers or neighbors speaking different greek dialects the dialects outside the ionic group are known mainly from inscriptions notable exceptions being fragments of the works of the poet sappho from the island of lesbos in aeolian and the poems of the boeotian poet pindar and other lyric poets usually in doric after the conquests of alexander the great in the late 4th century bc a new international dialect known as koine or common greek developed largely based on attic greek but with influence from other dialects this dialect slowly replaced most of the older dialects although doric dialect has survived in the tsakonian language which is spoken in the region of modern sparta doric has also passed down its aorist terminations into most verbs of demotic greek by about the 6th century ad the koine had slowly metamorphosized into medieval greek related languages or dialects edit ancient macedonian was an indo-european language closely related to greek but its exact relationship is unclear because of insufficient data possibly a dialect of greek a sibling language to greek or a close cousin to greek and perhaps related to some extent to thracian and phrygian languages the macedonian dialect or language appears to have been supplanted by attic greek in the hellenistic period 5 phonology edit differences from proto-indo-european edit ancient greek differs from proto-indo-european and other indo-european languages in certain ways in phonotactics ancient greek words could end only in a vowel or n s r final stops were lost as in milk compared with of milk genitive ancient greek of the classical period also differed in phonemic inventory pie s became h at the beginning of a word debuccalization latin sex english six ancient greek h ks pie s was elided between vowels after an intermediate step of debuccalization sanskrit janasas latin generis where s r by rhotacism greek genesos genehos ancient greek g neos attic g no s of a kind pie y j became h debuccalization or d z fortition sanskrit yas ancient greek h s who relative pronoun latin iugum english yoke ancient greek zyg s pie w which occurred in mycenaean and some non-attic dialects was lost early doric w rgon english work attic greek rgon pie and mycenaean labiovelars changed to plain stops labials dentals and velars in the later greek dialects for instance pie k became p or t in attic attic greek p where latin qu attic greek t s latin quis who pie voiced aspirated stops b d g g were devoiced and became the aspirated stops p t k in ancient greek phonemic inventory edit the pronunciation of ancient greek was very different from that of modern greek ancient greek had long and short vowels many diphthongs double and single consonants voiced voiceless and aspirated stops and a pitch accent in modern greek all vowels and consonants are short many vowels and diphthongs once pronounced distinctly are pronounced as i iotacism some of the stops and glides in diphthongs have become fricatives and the pitch accent has changed to a stress accent many of the changes took place in the koine greek period the writing system of modern greek however does not reflect all pronunciation changes the examples below represent attic greek in the 5th century bc ancient pronunciation cannot be reconstructed with certainty but greek from the period is well documented and there is little disagreement among linguists as to the general nature of the sounds that the letters represent consonants edit bilabial dental velar glottal nasal m n plosive voiced b d voiceless p t k aspirated p t k fricative s h trill r lateral l occurred as an allophone of n that was used before velars and as an allophone of before nasals r was probably voiceless when word-initial written s was assimilated to z before voiced consonants vowels edit front back unrounded rounded close i i y y close-mid e e o o open-mid open a a o raised to u probably by the 4th century bc morphology edit ostracon bearing the name of cimon stoa of attalos greek like all of the older indo-european languages is highly inflected it is highly archaic in its preservation of proto-indo-european forms in ancient greek nouns including proper nouns have five cases nominative genitive dative accusative and vocative three genders masculine feminine and neuter and three numbers singular dual and plural verbs have four moods indicative imperative subjunctive and optative and three voices active middle and passive as well as three persons first second and third and various other forms verbs are conjugated through seven combinations of tenses and aspect generally simply called tenses the present future and imperfect are imperfective in aspect the aorist perfective aspect a present perfect pluperfect and future perfect most tenses display all four moods and three voices although there is no future subjunctive or imperative also there is no imperfect subjunctive optative or imperative the infinitives and participles correspond to the finite combinations of tense aspect and voice augment edit the indicative of past tenses adds conceptually at least a prefix e- called the augment this was probably originally a separate word meaning something like then added because tenses in pie had primarily aspectual meaning the augment is added to the indicative of the aorist imperfect and pluperfect but not to any of the other forms of the aorist no other forms of the imperfect and pluperfect exist the two kinds of augment in greek are syllabic and quantitative the syllabic augment is added to stems beginning with consonants and simply prefixes e stems beginning with r however add er the quantitative augment is added to stems beginning with vowels and involves lengthening the vowel a e i o u ai i ei i or ei oi i au u or au eu u or eu ou ou some verbs augment irregularly the most common variation is e ei the irregularity can be explained diachronically by the loss of s between vowels in verbs with a prefix the augment is placed not at the start of the word but between the prefix and the original verb for example - i attack goes to o in the aorist following homer s practice the augment is sometimes not made in poetry especially epic poetry the augment sometimes substitutes for reduplication see below reduplication edit almost all forms of the perfect pluperfect and future perfect reduplicate the initial syllable of the verb stem note that a few irregular forms of perfect do not reduplicate whereas a handful of irregular aorists reduplicate the three types of reduplication are syllabic reduplication most verbs beginning with a single consonant or a cluster of a stop with a sonorant add a syllable consisting of the initial consonant followed by e an aspirated consonant however reduplicates in its unaspirated equivalent grassmann s law augment verbs beginning with a vowel as well as those beginning with a cluster other than those indicated previously and occasionally for a few other verbs reduplicate in the same fashion as the augment this remains in all forms of the perfect not just the indicative attic reduplication some verbs beginning with an a e or o followed by a sonorant or occasionally d or g reduplicate by adding a syllable consisting of the initial vowel and following consonant and lengthening the following vowel hence er er r an an n ol ol l ed ed d this is not actually specific to attic greek despite its name but it was generalized in attic this originally involved reduplicating a cluster consisting of a laryngeal and sonorant hence h l h leh l ol l with normal greek development of laryngeals forms with a stop were analogous irregular duplication can be understood diachronically for example lamban root lab has the perfect stem eil pha not lel pha because it was originally slamban with perfect sesl pha becoming eil pha through compensatory lengthening reduplication is also visible in the present tense stems of certain verbs these stems add a syllable consisting of the root s initial consonant followed by i a nasal stop appears after the reduplication in some verbs 6 writing system edit greek alphabet alpha nu beta xi gamma omicron delta pi epsilon

from the renaissance until the beginning of the 20th century ancient greek is still taught as a compulsory or optional subject especially at traditional or elite schools throughout europe such as public schools and grammar schools in the united kingdom it is compulsory in the liceo classico in italy in the gymnasium in the netherlands in some classes in austria in croatia in klasi na gimnazija in classical studies in aso in belgium and it is optional in the humanistisches gymnasium in germany usually as a third language after latin and english from the age of 14 to 18 in 2006 07 15,000 pupils studied ancient greek in germany according to the federal statistical office of germany and 280,000 pupils studied it in italy 7 it is a compulsory subject alongside latin in the humanities branch of spanish bachillerato ancient greek is also taught at most major universities worldwide often combined with latin as part of classics it will also be taught in state primary schools in the uk to boost children s language skills 8 9 and will be offered as a foreign language to pupils in all primary schools from 2014 as part of a major drive to boost education standards together with latin

edition in the language as well 16 ancient greek is also used by organizations and individuals mainly greek who wish to denote their respect admiration or preference for the use of this language this use is sometimes considered graphical nationalistic or funny in any case the fact that modern greeks can still wholly or partly understand texts written in non-archaic forms of ancient greek shows the affinity of modern greek language to its ancestral predecessor 17 an isolated community near trabzon turkey an area where pontic greek is spoken has been found to speak a variety of greek that has parallels both structurally and in its vocabulary to ancient greek not present in other varieties 18 as few as 5,000 people speak the dialect but linguists believe that it is the closest living
