allais effect refers to the alleged anomalous behavior of pendulums or gravimeters which is sometimes purportedly observed during a solar eclipse the effect was first reported as an anomalous precession of the plane of oscillation of a foucault pendulum during the solar eclipse of june 30 1954 by maurice allais a french polymath who went on to win the nobel prize in economics 1 he reported another observation of the effect during the solar eclipse of october 2 1959 using the paraconical pendulum he invented 2 3 this study earned him the 1959 galabert prize of the french astronautical society and made him a laureate of the us gravity research foundation for his 1959 memoir on gravity 4 contents 1 experimental observations 1.1 anomalous observations 1.2 inconclusive or negative experiments 2 aether hypothesis 3 see also 4 references 5 external links experimental observations edit maurice allais emphasized the dynamic character of the observed effects 5 the observed effects are only seen when the pendulum is moving they are not connected with the intensity of weight gravimetry but with the variation of weight or of inertia in the space swept by the pendulum actually while the movement of the plane of oscillation of the pendulum is inexplicable by the theory of gravitation the deviations from the vertical are explained perfectly by that theory the deviations from the vertical correspond to a static phenomenon while my experiments correspond to a dynamic phenomenon besides allais s own experiments related research about a possible effect of the moon s shielding absorption or bending of the sun s gravitational field have been conducted by various scientists some observations gave positive results and some failed to detect any noticeable effect anomalous observations edit romanian physicist gheorghe jeverdan et al observed the allais effect and the so-called jeverdan-rusu-antonescu effect or jeverdan effect i e the change of oscillation period of a pendulum during an eclipse monitoring a foucault pendulum during the solar eclipse of february 15 1961 the authors made two hypotheses regarding their observation during an eclipse the moon exerts a screening effect on the gravitational attraction of the sun so that the attraction of the earth is indirectly increased a phenomenon that could also be studied with tides if the hypothesis of the screening effect is wrong another explanation could be that the variation of the gravity of earth might be considered as a result of the diffraction of gravitational waves 6 7 erwin saxl and mildred allen reported strong anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during the solar eclipse of march 7 1970 and concluded that gravitational theory needs to be modified 8 dr leonid savrov of the sternberg astronomical institute built a dedicated paraconical pendulum to test the allais effect during the solar eclipse of july 11 1991 in mexico and the eclipse of november 3 1994 in brazil while he could not observe allais s claim that there is a diurnal periodicity in the motion of a paraconical pendulum he however wrote the most interesting result of the mexico and brazil experiments is the increase of rotational velocity of the pendulum oscillation plane in the direction of the foucault effect during the eclipse it seems that we have some kind of special effect 9 10 11 12 various other experiments using atomic clocks and gravimeters instead of pendulums also recorded significant anomalous gravitational effects which can neither be caused by a tidal effect or drift of the gravimeters nor by high frequency noise which have special patterns these experiments were set up by different teams during solar eclipses in china 1992 13 india 1995 14 china 1997 15 dutch physicist chris duif who surveys the field of gravitational anomalies in general concludes that the question remains open because allais observations do not satisfy conventional explanations and that such investigations should be pursued in view of their relatively inexpensive nature and the enormous implications if genuine anomalies are actually confirmed but the article was self-published and has not undergone any peer review 16 result confirming observation of the allais and jeverdan-rusu-antonescu effects during the annular solar eclipse of september 22 2006 has been presented the year after by a romanian team with a quantization of the behavior of the paraconical pendulum 17 during the solar eclipse of august 1 2008 a ukrainian team and two romanian teams worked together hundreds of kilometers apart with different apparatuses five independent miniature torsion balances for the ukrainian team two independent short ball-borne pendulums for a romanian team and a long foucault pendulum for the third team all three teams detected unexplained and mutually correlated disturbances 18 same teams repeated a dual experiment during the annular solar eclipse of january 26 2009 this time outside of the shadow zone with the same significant correlation between the behavior of light torsion balances and a foucault pendulum 19 they also registered similar anomalies using a foucault pendulum and a very light torsion balance both located underground in a disused salt mine with minimal interference during the partial solar eclipse of june 1 2011 inconclusive or negative experiments edit louis b slichter using a gravimeter during the solar eclipse of february 15 1961 in florence italy failed to detect an associated gravitational signal 20 during the solar eclipse of july 22 1990 no anomalous period increase of a torsion pendulum during the eclipse have been detected independently by a team in finland 21 and another in belomorsk ussr 22 the total solar eclipse of august 11 1999 had been a good opportunity to solve a 45-year mystery thanks to an international collaboration nasa s marshall space flight center first inquired about experimental protocols to maurice allais 5 in order to coordinate ahead of the event a worldwide effort to test the allais effect between observatories and universities over seven countries united states austria germany italy australia england and four sites in the united arab emirates the lead supervisor then stated the initial interpretation of the record points to three possibilities a systematic error a local effect or the unexplored to eliminate the first two possibilities we and several other observers will use different kinds of measuring instruments in a distributed global network of observing stations 23 24 however after the eclipse allais criticized the experiments in his final nasa report writing the period of observation was much too short to detect anomalies properly 5 moreover the lead supervisor left nasa shortly thereafter with the gathered data and the nasa study has never been published 25 further observations of the team lead by xin-she yang appear to have yielded much weaker evidence of anomalies than their first 1997 study the authors first posited a more conventional explanation based on temperature changes causing ground tilting but they suggested that this explanation was unlikely 26 a possible but yet controversial explanation has been finally proposed by the same author and tom van flandern who conjecture the anomaly is due to the gravitational effect of an increased air density spot in the upper atmosphere created by cooling winds during the solar eclipse they conclude there have been no unambiguous detections of an allais effect within the past 30 years when consciousness of the importance of experimental controls was more widespread they point out that the gravitation anomaly discussed here is about a factor of 100,000 too small to explain the allais excess pendulum precession during eclipses and from this conclude that the original allais anomaly was merely due to poor controls 27 eight gravimeters and two pendulums were deployed across six monitoring sites in china for the solar eclipse of july 22 2009 28 although one of the scientists involved described in an interview to have observed the allais effect 29 no result has been published in any academic journal an automated foucault pendulum was used during the solar eclipse of july 11 2010 in argentina with no evidence of a precession change of the pendulum s oscillation plane 0.3 degree per hour 30 aether hypothesis edit maurice allais states that the eclipse effect is related to a gravitational anomaly that is inexplicable in the framework of the currently admitted theory of gravitation without giving any explanation of his own 31 allais s explanation for another anomaly the lunisolar periodicity in variations of the azimuth of a pendulum is that space evinces certain anisotropic characteristics which he ascribes to motion through an aether which is partially entrained by planetary bodies his hypothesis leads to a speed of light dependent on the moving direction with respect to a terrestrial observer since the earth moves within the aether but the rotation of the moon induces a wind of about 8 km s thus allais rejects einstein s interpretation of the michelson morley experiment and the subsequent verification experiments of dayton miller 32 33 in particular the michelson morley experiment did not give a zero speed difference but at most 8 km s without being able to detect any regularity this difference was therefore interpreted as due to measurement uncertainties similarly miller s experiments corroborated these results over a long period of time but miller could not explain the source of the irregularities at the time temperature problems were invoked to explain the cause as concluded by robert s shankland 34 by re-analyzing the data from this experiment allais reported a periodicity using sidereal time rather than civil time used by miller daytime sidereal variation of the speed of light over a period of 23 hours 56 minutes with an amplitude of about 8 km s 35 applying titius bode law to the earth-moon system which he generalizes to aether allais calculates a wind of 7.95 km s which is comparable to the values found by the experiments of michelson and miller hence allais deduces that the aether turns with the stars as proposed by the aether drag hypothesis and is not fixed as lorentz thought when inventing his famous transformation and his ether theory but the majority of scientists of the end of the nineteenth century imagining that such an aether crossed the earth through so that the rotation of the earth around the sun would cause an important variation of 30 km s consequently since the third postulate on which is based special relativity is the constancy of the speed of light in a vacuum allais considers it as unfounded in order to measure a change in the speed of light one would have to get back to the definition of the 1960 meter since the confidence in the theory of relativity nowadays is such that current metrology uses constancy of the speed of light as an axiom allais summarized his experimental work in english in his 1999 memoir on behalf of nasa 5 he detailed his aether hypothesis in the books l anisotropie de l espace published in 1997 31 and l effondrement de la th orie de la relativit published in 2004 36 a book on allais s scientific legacy has been edited in english in 2011 37 yet his aether hypothesis has not gained significant traction amongst mainstream scientists nevertheless after allais s death in 2010 experiments on the allais effect carry on 38 see also edit maurice
