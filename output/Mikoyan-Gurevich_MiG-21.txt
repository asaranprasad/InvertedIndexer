continuation of soviet jet fighters starting with the subsonic mig-15 and mig-17 and the supersonic mig-19 a number of experimental mach 2 soviet designs were based on nose intakes with either swept-back wings such as the sukhoi su-7 or tailed deltas of which the mig-21 would be the most successful development of what would become the mig-21 began in the early 1950s when mikoyan okb finished a preliminary design study for a prototype designated ye-1 in 1954 this project was very quickly reworked when it was determined that the planned engine was underpowered the redesign led to the second prototype the ye-2 both these and other early prototypes featured swept wings the first prototype with delta wings as found on production variants was the ye-4 it made its maiden flight on 16 june 1955 and its first public appearance during the soviet aviation day display at moscow s tushino airfield in july 1956 in the west due to the lack of available information early details of the mig-21 often were confused with those of similar soviet fighters of the era in one instance jane s all the world s aircraft 1960 1961 listed the fishbed as a sukhoi design and used an illustration of the su-9 fishpot design edit hungarian air force mig-21bis on takeoff mig-21 at aleksotas airport s dariaus s gireno kaunas eyks mig-21 national people s army of the gdr august 1990 the mig-21 was the first successful soviet aircraft combining fighter and interceptor characteristics in a single aircraft it was a lightweight fighter achieving mach 2 with a relatively low-powered afterburning turbojet and is thus comparable to the american lockheed f-104 starfighter and northrop f-5 freedom fighter and the french dassault mirage iii 1 its basic layout was used for numerous other soviet designs delta-winged aircraft included su-9 interceptor and the fast e-150 prototype from mig bureau while the mass-produced successful front fighter su-7 and mikoyan s i-75 experimental interceptor combined a similar fuselage shape with swept-back wings however the characteristic layout with the shock cone and front air intake did not see widespread use outside the ussr and finally proved to have limited development potential mainly because of the very small space available for the radar like many aircraft designed as interceptors the mig-21 had a short range this was exacerbated by the poor placement of the internal fuel tanks ahead of the centre of gravity as the internal fuel was consumed the center of gravity would shift rearward beyond acceptable parameters this had the effect of making the plane statically unstable to the point of being difficult to control resulting in an endurance of only 45 minutes in clean condition this can be somewhat countered by carrying fuel in external tanks closer to the center of gravity the chinese variants somewhat improved the internal fuel tank layout also second generation of soviet variants and also carry significantly larger external fuel tanks to counter this issue 3 additionally when more than half the fuel was used up violent maneuvers prevented fuel from flowing into the engine questionable thereby causing it to shut down in flight this increased the risk of tank implosions mig-21 had tanks pressurized with air from the engine s compressor a problem inherited from the mig-15 mig-17 and mig-19 4 the short endurance and low fuel capacity of the mig-21f pf pfm s sm and m mf variants though each had a somewhat greater fuel capacity than its predecessor led to the development of the mt and smt variants these had an increased range of 250 km 155 mi compared to the mig-21sm but at the cost of worsening all other performance figures such as a lower service ceiling and slower time to altitude 1 a pole mounted mig-21 the delta wing while excellent for a fast-climbing interceptor meant any form of turning combat led to a rapid loss of speed however the light loading of the aircraft could mean that a climb rate of 235 m s 46,250 ft min was possible with a combat-loaded mig-21bis 1 not far short of the performance of the later f-16a given a skilled pilot and capable missiles it could give a good account of itself against contemporary fighters its g-limits were increased from 7gs in initial variants to 8.5gs in the latest variants 5 it was replaced by the newer variable-geometry mig-23 and mig-27 for ground support duties however not until the mig-29 would the soviet union ultimately replace the mig-21 as a maneuvering dogfighter to counter new american air superiority types the mig-21 was exported widely and remains in use the aircraft s simple controls engine weapons and avionics were typical of soviet-era military designs the use of a tail with the delta wing aids stability and control at the extremes of the flight envelope enhancing safety for lower-skilled pilots this in turn enhanced its marketability in exports to developing countries with limited training programs and restricted pilot pools while technologically inferior to the more advanced fighters it often faced low production and maintenance costs made it a favorite of nations buying eastern bloc military hardware several russian israeli and romanian firms have begun to offer upgrade packages to mig-21 operators designed to bring the aircraft up to a modern standard with greatly upgraded avionics and armaments 1 production edit czechoslovak mig-21f-13 fishbed c a total of 10,645 aircraft were built in the ussr they were produced in three factories az 30 n 1 3,203 aircraft in moscow also known as

aviation museum in bucharest romania mig-21f-13 rear view the mig-21 has a delta wing the sweep angle on the leading edge is 57 with a tsagi s-12 airfoil the angle of incidence is 0 while the dihedral angle is 2 on the trailing edge there are ailerons with an area of 1.18 m and flaps with an area of 1.87 m in front of the ailerons there are small wing fences the fuselage is semi-monocoque with an elliptical profile and a maximum width of 1.24 m 4 ft 1 in the air flow to the engine is regulated by an inlet cone in the air intake on early model mig-21s the cone has three positions for speeds up to mach 1.5 the cone is fully retracted to the maximum aft position for speeds between mach 1.5 and mach 1.9 the cone moves to the middle position for speeds higher than mach 1.9 the cone moves to the maximum forward position on the later model mig-21pf the intake cone moves to a position based on the actual speed the cone position for a given speed is calculated by the uvd-2m system using air pressures from in front and behind the compressor of the engine on both sides of the nose there are gills to supply the engine with more air while on the ground and during takeoff in the first variant of the mig-21 the pitot tube is attached to the bottom of the nose after the mig-21p variant this tube is attached to the top of the air intake later versions shifted the pitot tube attachment point 15 degrees to the right as seen from the cockpit and had an emergency pitot head on the right side just ahead of the canopy and below the pilot s eyeline the cabin is pressurized and air conditioned on variants prior to the mig-21pfm the cabin canopy is hinged at the front when ejecting the sk-1 ejection seat connects with the canopy to make a capsule that encloses the pilot the capsule protects the pilot from the high-speed airflow encountered during high-speed ejections after ejection the capsule opens to allow the pilot to parachute to the ground however ejecting at low altitudes can cause the canopy to take too long to separate sometimes resulting in pilot death the minimum height for ejection in level flight was 110 m starting from the mig-21pfm the canopy is hinged on the right side of the cockpit on the under side of the aircraft there are three air brakes two at the front and one at the rear the front air brakes have an area of 0.76 m and a deflection angle of 35 the rear air brake has an area of 0.46 m and a deflection angle of 40 the rear air brake is blocked if the airplane carries an external fuel tank behind the air brakes are the bays for the main landing gear on the under side of the airplane just behind the trailing edge of the wing are attachment points for two jato rockets the front section of the fuselage ends at former 28 the rear section of the fuselage starts at former 28a and is removable for engine maintenance the empennage of the mig-21 consists of a vertical stabilizer a stabilator and a small fin on the bottom of the tail to improve yaw control the vertical stabilizer has a sweep angle of 60 and an area of 5.32 m on earlier version 3.8 m and a rudder the stabilator has a sweep angle of 57 an area of 3.94 m and a span of 2.6 m the mig-21 uses a tricycle type undercarriage on most variants the main landing gear uses tires that are 800 mm in diameter and 200 mm in width only the mig-21f variants use tires with the size 660x200 mm the wheels of the main landing gear retract into the fuselage after rotating 87 and the shock absorbers retract into the wing the nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar the nose wheel can be lowered manually by simply unlocking its hatch from inside the cockpit thus landing with undercarriage locked in the up position due to an internal failure was not a major issue with a number of such successful landings on the nosewheel ventral fuel tank or the airbrake operational history edit india edit overview edit iaf mig-21 bison india is the third largest operator of mig-21s behind russia and china in 1961 the indian air force iaf opted to purchase the mig-21 over several other western competitors as part of the deal the soviet union offered india full transfer of technology and rights for local assembly 6 in 1964 the mig-21 became the first supersonic fighter jet to enter service with the iaf due to limited induction numbers and lack of pilot training the iaf mig-21 played a limited role in the indo-pakistani war of 1965 7 however the iaf gained valuable experience while operating the mig-21 for defensive sorties during the war 7 the positive feedback from iaf pilots during the 1965 war prompted india to place more orders for the fighter jet and also invest heavily in building the mig-21 s maintenance infrastructure and pilot training programs since 1963 india has introduced more than 1,200 mig fighters into its air force as of august 2013 at least 252 mig-21s are known to be in operation however the plane has been plagued by safety problems since 1970 more than 170 indian pilots and 40 civilians have been killed in mig-21 accidents at least 14 mig-21s have crashed between 2010 and 2013 8 over half of the 840 aircraft built between 1966 and 1984 were lost to crashes 9 when in afterburner the engine operates very close to its surge line and the ingestion of even a small bird can lead to an engine surge seizure and flame out on 11 december 2013 india s second generation supersonic jet fighter mig-21fl was decommissioned after being in service for 50 years 10 in view of the several incidents that have occurred after the 1999 kargil war the modernized mig-21 bison seems to have at present the role of an interceptor and possibly a limited role of a fighter aircraft 11 12 the remaining mig-21 bisons of the iaf are scheduled to be phased out by 2019 13 1971 india pakistan war edit the expansion of iaf mig-21 fleet marked a developing india-soviet union military partnership which enabled india to field a formidable air force to counter chinese and pakistani threats 14 the capabilities of the mig-21 were put to the test during the bangladesh liberation war during the war the mig-21s played a crucial role in giving the iaf air superiority over vital points and areas in the western theater of the conflict 15 the 1971 war witnessed the first supersonic air combat in the subcontinent when an indian mig-21fls claimed a paf f-104 starfighter with its gsh-23 twin-barrelled 23 mm cannon 16 by the time the hostilities came to an end the iaf mig-21s had claimed four paf f-104s two paf shenyang f-6 one paf north american f-86 sabre and one paf lockheed c-130 hercules according to one western military analyst the mig-21s had clearly won the much anticipated air combat between the mig-21 and the f-104 starfighter 17 because of the formidable performance of the mig-21s several nations including iraq approached india for mig-21 pilot training by the early 1970s more than 120 iraqi pilots were being trained by the indian air force 18 kargil war and atlantique incident edit it was also used as late as 1999 in the kargil war in which one indian air force mig-21s was destroyed by ground fire 19 the mig-21 s last known kill took place in 1999 during the atlantique incident when two mig-21 aircraft of the indian air force intercepted and shot down a breguet atlantique reconnaissance aircraft of the pakistani navy

over north vietnam 22 the first mig-21s arrived directly from the soviet union by ship in april 1966 after being unloaded and assembled 23 they were given to north vietnam s oldest fighter unit the 921st fighter regiment which had been created on 3 february 1964 as a mig-17 unit because the north vietnamese air force s 923rd fr was newer and less experienced they would continue to operate mig-17s while the arrival of the mig-19s j6 versions from china in 1969 would create north vietnam s only mig-19 unit the 925th fr on 3 february 1972 north vietnam commissioned their fourth and last fighter regiment created during the war with the republic of vietnam the mig-21pfm type 94 equipped 927th fighter regiment 24 although 13 of north vietnam s flying aces attained their status while flying the mig-21 cf three in the mig-17 many north vietnamese pilots preferred the mig-17 because the high wing loading of the mig-21 made it relatively less maneuverable and the lighter framed canopy of the mig-17 gave better visibility 25 however this is not the impression perceived by british author roger boniface when he interviewed pham ngoc lan and ace nguy n nh t chi u who scored victories flying both mig-17 and mig-21 26 27 pham ngoc lan told boniface that the mig-21 was much faster and it had two atoll missiles which were very accurate and reliable when fired between 1,000 and 1,200 yards 28 29 and chi u asserted that for me personally i preferred the mig-21 because it was superior in all specifications in climb speed and armament the atoll missile was very accurate and i scored four kills with the atoll in general combat conditions i was always confident of a kill over a f-4 phantom when flying a mig-21 30 31 although the mig-21 lacked the long-range radar missiles

14 f-105s without any losses 42 the u s air force and the u s navy continued to lay down great expectations on the f4 phantom assuming that the massive firepower the best available on-board radar the highest speed and acceleration properties coupled with new tactics would provide phantoms with an advantage over the migs but in confrontations with the lighter mig-21 f-4s began to suffer losses from may to december 1966 the u s air forces lost 47 aircraft destroying only 12 nvaf fighters in return from april 1965 to november 1968 over 268 air battles occurred over the skies of north vietnam north

occurred during operation linebacker ii also known as the christmas bombings 50 these air-to-air kills were not confirmed by vpaf the biggest threat to north vietnam during the war had always been the strategic air command s b-52 stratofortress hanoi s mig-17 and mig-19 interceptors could not deal with those bombers at their flying altitude in the summer of 1972 the nvaf was directed to train 12 mig-21 pilots for the specific mission of attacking and shooting down b-52 bombers with two-thirds of those pilots specifically trained in the night attack 51 on 26 december 1972 just two days after tail gunner albert moore downed his mig-21 a vpaf north vietnamese air force mig-21mf number 5121 52 from the 921st fighter regiment flown by major ph m tu n over hanoi north vietnam claimed responsibility for the first aerial combat kill of a u s air force boeing b-52 stratofortress in aviation history 53 the stratofortress had been above hanoi at over 30,000 feet 9,100 m during operation linebacker ii when major tu n launched two atoll missiles from 2 kilometres claiming to have destroyed one of the bombers flying in the three plane formation 53 other sources argue that his missiles failed to hit their mark but as he was disengaging a b-52 from a three-bomber cell in front of his target took a hit from a sam exploding in mid-air this may have caused tu n to think his

six-day war the israeli air force struck arab air forces in four attack waves in the first wave idf aircraft claimed to have destroyed eight egyptian aircraft in air-to-air combat of which seven were mig-21s egypt claimed five kills scored by mig-21pfs 58 during the second wave israel claimed four mig-21s downed in air-to-air combat and the third wave resulted in two syrian and one iraqi mig-21s claimed destroyed in the air the fourth wave destroyed many more syrian mig-21s on the ground overall egypt lost around 100 out of about 110 mig-21s they had almost all on the ground syria lost 35 of

israel claimed a total of 25 syrian mig-21s destroyed the syrians claimed three confirmed and four probable kills of israel aircraft although israel denied these 1 high losses to egyptian aircraft and continuous bombing during the war of attrition caused egypt to ask the soviet union for help in june 1970 soviet pilots and sam crews arrived with their equipment on 22 june 1970 a soviet pilot flying a mig-21mf shot down an israeli a-4e after some more successful intercepts by soviet pilots and another israeli a-4 being shot down on 25 july israel decided to plan an ambush in response on 30 july

israel israel claimed a total of 12 syrian mig-21s destroyed while syria claimed eight kills scored by mig-21s and admitted five losses during the yom kippur war israel claimed 73 kills against egyptian mig-21s 65 confirmed egypt claimed 27 confirmed kills against israeli aircraft by its mig-21s plus eight probables 1 however according to most israeli sources these were exaggerated claims as

idf 1 between the end of the yom kippur war and the start of the 1982 lebanon war israel had received modern f-15s and f-16s which were far superior to the old syrian mig-21mfs according to the idf these new aircraft accounted for the destruction of 24 syrian mig-21s over this time period though syria did claim five kills against idf aircraft with their mig-21s armed with outdated k-13 missiles although israel denied they suffered any losses 1 the 1982 lebanon war started on 6 june 1982 and in the course of that war the idf claimed to have destroyed about 45 syrian mig-21mfs syria claimed

different antiaircraft guns and chinese manpads up to modern designs such as the fn-6 the first loss of a mig-21 was recorded on 30 august 2012 its registration was 2271 it was likely downed on take off or landing at abu al-duhur military airbase under siege by rebels by heavy machine gun fire 64 a few days later a second mig-21 registered 2280 was shot down and recorded on video on 4 september 2012 it was likely downed on take off or landing at abu dhuhur air base under siege by rebels by kpv 14.5 mm machine gun fire 65 on 10 november 2014 a syrian air force mig-21bis serialed 2204 was shot down by rebels either using a manpads or antiaircraft guns near sabboura town 45 km east of hama airbase where it was likely based the pilot was killed video and picture evidence of the crash site

near kafr nabudah there were conflicting accounts of how it was brought down the syrian observatory for human rights reported the warplane had been downed by two manpads while jaysh al-nasr militants say they shot it down with anti-aircraft guns 68 video evidence suggesting it was a manpads it seems the pilot ejected but died either killed by ground fire while descending or other causes 69 other

ground targets manned by rebel forces or engage south african air force mirage f1s conducting cross-border strikes most mig-21 losses over angola were attributed to accurate ground fire such as an example downed by national union for the total independence of angola unita insurgents near luena with an american fim-92 stinger 80 despite extensive losses to man-portable air-defense systems mig-21s were instrumental during the battle of cuito cuanavale cuban pilots became accustomed to flying up to three sorties a day both the mig-21mf and the mig-21bis were deployed almost exclusively in the fighter bomber role as interceptors they were somewhat unsuccessful due to their inability to detect low-flying south african aircraft 81 on november 6 1981 a mirage f1cz achieved south africa s first confirmed air-to-air kill since the korean war when it destroyed cuban lieutenant danacio valdez s mig-21mf with 30mm cannon fire 82 on 5 october 1982 mirages escorting an english electric canberra on routine reconnaissance over cahama were engaged by at least two mig-21bis a south african radar operator picked up the attacking migs and was able to alert the mirage pilots in advance instructing them to change course immediately as they jettisoned their auxiliary tanks however they were pinpointed by the cubans who opened pursuit in a vicious dogfight saaf major johann rankin closed range and maneuvered into the migs rear cones from there one of his two r.550 magic missiles impacted directly behind the lead mig and forced it down the second aircraft piloted by a lieutenant raciel marrero rodriguez could not detect the mirage s proximity until it had entered his turn radius and was perforated by rankin s autocannon this damaged mig-21 landed safely at lubango 82 contacts between mig-21s and saaf mirage f1s or mirage iiis became increasingly common throughout the 1980s between 1984 and 1988 thirteen mig-21s were lost over angola 83 on 9 august 1984 a particularly catastrophic accident occurred when the 9th fighter training squadrons and the 12th fighter squadrons of the cuban air force attempted to carry out an exercise in poor weather a single mig-21bis and three mig-23s were lost 81 on 14 december 1988 an angolan air force mig-21bis strayed off course and executed an emergency landing in namibia where it was seized by local authorities since angola did

while croatian and slovenian forces did not have air forces at the beginning of the war aircraft from air bases in slovenia croatia and bosnia and herzegovina were relocated to air bases in serbia detailed records show at least seven mig-21s were shot down by aa defenses in croatia and bosnia 86 a mig-21 shot down an ec helicopter in 1992 87 croatia acquired three mig-21s in 1992 through defections by croatian pilots serving with the jna two of which were lost in subsequent actions one to serbian air defenses the other in a friendly fire accident 88 in 1993 croatia purchased about 40 mig-21s in violation of an arms embargo 88 but only about 20 of these entered service while the rest were used for spare parts croatia used them alongside the sole remaining defector for ground attack missions in operations flash during which one was lost and storm the only air-to-air action for croatian migs was an attempt by two of them to intercept soko j-22 oraos of republika srpska air force
