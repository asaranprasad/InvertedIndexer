official for the metric ton in the united states having been adopted by the us national institute of standards and technology 7 it is a symbol not an abbreviation and should not be followed by a period informal and non-approved symbols or abbreviations include t mt mt and mt 8 some of these are si symbols for other units t is the si symbol for the tesla and mt is the si symbol for megatonne equivalent to one teragram if describing tnt equivalent units of energy this is equivalent to 4.184 petajoules origin and spelling edit in french and all english-speaking countries that are predominantly metric tonne is the correct spelling it is usually pronounced the same as ton t n but when it is important to clarify that the metric term is meant rather than short ton the final e can also be pronounced i e tonny t n 9 in australia it is also pronounced t n 10 before metrication in the uk the unit used for most purposes was the imperial ton of 2,240 pounds avoirdupois usually referred to as the long ton in the us equivalent to 1,016 kg differing by just 1.6 from the tonne the uk weights and measures act 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade certain imperial units including the ton unless the item being sold or the weighing equipment being used was weighed or certified prior to 1 december 1980 and even then only if the buyer was made aware that the weight of the item was measured in imperial units 11 full citation needed 12 13 in the united states metric ton is the name for this unit used and recommended by nist 7 an unqualified mention of a ton almost invariably refers to a short ton of 2,000 pounds 907 kg and tonne is rarely used in speech or writing ton and tonne are both derived from a germanic word in general use in the north sea area since the middle ages cf old english and old frisian tunne old high german and medieval latin tunna german and french tonne to designate a large cask or tun 14 a full tun standing about a metre high could easily weigh a tonne an english tun an old wine cask volume measurement equivalent to 954 litres of wine weighs roughly a tonne 954 kg if full of water a little less for wine the spelling tonne pre-dates the introduction of the si in 1960 it has been used with this meaning in france since 1842 15 when there were no metric prefixes for multiples of 106 and above and is now used as the standard spelling for the metric mass measurement in most english-speaking countries 16 17 18 19 in the united states the unit was originally referred to using the french words millier or tonneau 20 but these terms are now obsolete 3 the imperial and us customary units comparable to the tonne are both spelled ton in english though they differ in mass conversions edit one tonne is equivalent to

kilotonne megatonne and gigatonne are more usually used for the energy of nuclear explosions and other events often loosely as approximate figures when used in this context there is little need to

to about 9.8 kilonewtons a unit also often called simply tonne or metric ton without identifying it as a unit of force in contrast to the tonne as a mass unit the tonne-force or metric ton-force is
