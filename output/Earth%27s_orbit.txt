https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit earth s orbit from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the earth at different points in its orbit earth s orbit is the trajectory along which earth travels around the sun the average distance between the earth and the sun is 149.60 million km 92.96 million mi 1 and one complete orbit takes 365.256 days 1 sidereal year during which time earth has traveled 940 million km 584 million mi 2 earth s orbit has an eccentricity of 0.0167 as seen from earth the planet s orbital prograde motion makes the sun appear to move with respect to other stars at a rate of about 1 or a sun or moon diameter every 12 hours eastward per solar day nb 1 earth s orbital speed averages about 30 km s 108,000 km h 67,000 mph which is fast enough to cover the planet s diameter in 7 minutes and the distance to the moon in 4 hours 3 from a vantage point above the north pole of either the sun or earth earth would appear to revolve in a counterclockwise direction around the sun from the same vantage point both the earth and the sun would appear to rotate also in a counterclockwise direction about their respective axes contents 1

comparison to the geocentric model upper panel heliocentrism is the scientific model that first placed the sun at the center of the solar system and put the planets including earth in its orbit historically heliocentrism is opposed to geocentrism which placed the earth at the center aristarchus of samos already proposed a heliocentric model in the 3rd century bc in the 16th century nicolaus copernicus de revolutionibus presented a full discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe 4 in much the same way as ptolemy had presented his geocentric model in the 2nd century this copernican revolution resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent although copernicus s groundbreaking book had been printed over a century earlier the dutch mapmaker joan blaeu was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world 5 influence on earth edit because of earth s axial tilt often known as the obliquity of the ecliptic the inclination of the sun s trajectory in the sky as seen by an observer on earth s surface varies over the course of the year for an observer at a northern latitude when the north pole is tilted toward the sun the day lasts longer and the sun appears higher in the sky this results in warmer average temperatures as additional solar radiation reaches the surface when the north pole is tilted away from the sun the reverse is true and the weather is generally cooler above the arctic circle and below the antarctic circle an extreme case is reached in which there is no daylight at all for part of the year this is called a polar night this variation in the weather because of the direction of the earth s axial tilt results in the seasons 6 events in the orbit edit by astronomical convention the four seasons are determined by the solstices the two points in the earth s orbit of the maximum tilt of the earth s axis towards the sun or away from the sun and the equinoxes the two points in the earth s orbit where the earth s tilted axis and an imaginary line drawn from the earth to the sun are exactly perpendicular to one another the solstices and equinoxes divide the year up into four approximately equal parts in the northern hemisphere winter solstice occurs on or about december 21 summer solstice is near june 21 spring equinox is around march 20 and autumnal equinox is about september 23 7 the effect of the earth s axial tilt in the southern hemisphere is the opposite of that in the northern hemisphere thus the seasons of the solstices and equinoxes in the southern hemisphere are the reverse of those in the northern hemisphere e g the northern summer solstice is at the same time as the southern winter solstice in modern times earth s perihelion occurs around january 3 and the aphelion around july 4 for other eras see precession and milankovitch cycles the changing earth sun distance results in an increase of about 6.9 8 in total solar energy reaching the earth at perihelion relative to aphelion since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that the earth reaches the closest approach to the sun the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year however this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere 9 the hill sphere gravitational sphere of influence of the earth is about 1,500,000 kilometers 0.01 au in radius or approximately 4 times the average distance to the moon 10 nb 2 this is the maximal distance at which the earth s gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant sun and planets objects orbiting the earth must be within this radius otherwise they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the sun orbital

axial tilt of the earth in its orbit the maximal intensity of sun rays hits the earth 23.4 degrees north of equator at the june solstice at the tropic of cancer and 23.4 degrees south of equator at the december solstice at the tropic of capricorn 14 future edit mathematicians and astronomers such as laplace lagrange gauss poincar kolmogorov vladimir arnold and j rgen moser have searched for evidence for the stability of the planetary motions and this quest led to many mathematical developments and several successive proofs of stability for the solar system 15 by most predictions earth s orbit will be relatively stable over long periods 16 in 1989 jacques laskar s work indicated that the earth s orbit as well as the orbits of all the inner planets can become chaotic and that an error as small as 15 meters in measuring the initial position of the earth today would make it impossible to predict where the earth would be in its orbit in just over 100 million years time 17 modeling the solar system is a subject covered by the n-body problem see also edit astronomical unit barycenter earth s axial tilt earth s rotation geocentric orbit the orbit of any object orbiting the earth such as the moon or an artificial satellite satellite space station notes edit our planet takes about 365 days to orbit the sun a full orbit has 360 that fact demonstrates that each day the earth travels roughly 1 in its orbit thus the sun will appear to move eastward across the sky relative to the stars by that same amount for the earth the hill radius is r h a m 3 m 1 3 displaystyle r h a left frac
