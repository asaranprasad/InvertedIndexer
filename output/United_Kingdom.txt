bailiwick of guernsey and bailiwick of jersey are not part of the uk being crown dependencies with the british government responsible for defence and international representation 19 prior to the creation of the uk wales had been conquered and annexed by the kingdom of england this meant that the united kingdom created in 1707 by the treaty of union between england and scotland encompassed all of great britain the kingdom of ireland merged with this state in 1801 to form the united kingdom of great britain and ireland five-sixths of ireland seceded from the uk in 1922 leaving the present formulation of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland note 10 there are fourteen british overseas territories 20 the remnants of the british empire which at its height in the 1920s encompassed almost a quarter of the world s land mass and was the largest empire in history british influence can be observed in the language culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies the uk is a developed country and has the world s sixth-largest economy by nominal gdp 21 and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity it has a high-income economy and has a very high human development index ranking 16th in the world it was the first industrialised country and the world s foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries 22 23 the uk remains a great power with

1707 acts of union declared that the kingdoms of england and scotland were united into one kingdom by the name of great britain though the new state is also referred to in the acts as the kingdom of great britain united kingdom of great britain and united kingdom 27 28 note 11 the term united kingdom is found in informal use during the 18th century and the country was also occasionally referred to as the united kingdom of great britain though its full official name from 1707 to 1800 was merely great britain without a long form 29 30 31 32 33 the acts of union 1800 united the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland in 1801 forming the united kingdom of great britain and ireland following the partition of ireland and the independence of the irish free state in 1922 which left northern ireland as the only part of the island of ireland within the united kingdom the name united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland was adopted 34 although the united kingdom as a sovereign state is a country england scotland wales and to a lesser degree northern ireland are also regarded as countries though they are not sovereign states 35 36 scotland wales and northern ireland have devolved self-government 37 38 the british prime minister s website has used the phrase countries within a country to describe the united kingdom 15 some statistical summaries such as those for the twelve nuts 1 regions of the united kingdom also refer to scotland wales and northern ireland as regions 39 40 northern ireland is also referred to as a province 41 42 with regard to northern ireland the descriptive name used can be controversial with the choice often revealing one s political preferences 43 the term britain is often used as synonym for the united kingdom the term great britain by contrast refers conventionally to the island of great britain or politically to england scotland and wales in combination 44 45 46 however it is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the united kingdom as a whole 47 not in citation given 48 gb and gbr are the standard country codes for the united kingdom see iso 3166-2 and iso 3166-1 alpha-3 and are consequently used by international organisations to refer to the united kingdom additionally the united kingdom s olympic team competes under the name great britain or team gb 49 50 the adjective british is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the united kingdom the term has no definite legal connotation but is used in law to refer to united kingdom citizenship and matters to do with nationality 51 people of the united kingdom use a number of different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being british or as being english scottish welsh northern irish or irish 52 or as being both 53 in welsh the long form name of the state is teyrnas unedig prydain fawr a gogledd iwerddon with teyrnas unedig being used as a short form name on government websites 54 however it is usually abbreviated to du for the mutated form y deyrnas unedig in scottish gaelic the long form is r oghachd aonaichte bhreatainn is ireann a tuath and the short form r oghachd aonaichte history background stonehenge in wiltshire was erected around 2500 bc settlement by anatomically modern humans of what was to become the united kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago 55 by the end of the region s prehistoric period the population is thought to have belonged in the main to a culture termed insular celtic comprising brythonic britain and gaelic ireland 56 the roman conquest beginning in 43 ad and the 400-year rule of southern britain was followed by an invasion by germanic anglo-saxon settlers reducing the brythonic area mainly to what was to become wales cornwall and the historic kingdom of strathclyde 57 most of the region settled by the anglo-saxons became unified as the kingdom of england in the 10th century 58 meanwhile gaelic-speakers in north-west britain with connections to the north-east of ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century 59 60 united with the picts to create the kingdom of scotland in the 9th century 61 the bayeux tapestry depicts the battle of hastings 1066 and the events leading to it in 1066 the normans and their breton allies invaded england from northern france and after its conquest seized large parts of wales conquered much of ireland and were invited to settle in scotland bringing to each country feudalism on the northern french model and norman-french culture 62 the norman elites greatly influenced but eventually assimilated with each of the local cultures 63 subsequent medieval english kings completed the conquest of wales and made an unsuccessful attempt to annex scotland following the declaration of arbroath scotland maintained its independence albeit in near-constant conflict with england the english monarchs through inheritance of substantial territories in france and claims to the french crown were also heavily involved in conflicts in france most notably the hundred years war while the kings of scots were in an alliance with the french during this period 64 the early modern period saw religious conflict resulting from the reformation and the introduction of protestant state churches in each country 65 wales was fully incorporated into the kingdom of england 66 and ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the english crown 67 in what was to become northern ireland the lands of the independent catholic gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to protestant settlers from england and scotland 68 in 1603 the kingdoms of england scotland and ireland were united in a personal union when james vi king of scots inherited the crowns of england and ireland and moved his court from edinburgh to london each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political legal and religious institutions 69 70 in the mid-17th century all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars including the english civil war which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the commonwealth of england scotland and ireland 71 72 during the 17th and 18th centuries british sailors were involved in acts of piracy privateering attacking and stealing from ships off the coast of europe and the caribbean 73 the state house in st george s bermuda settled in 1612 the town is the oldest continuously-inhabited english town in the new world although the monarchy was restored the interregnum ensured along with the glorious revolution of 1688 and the subsequent bill of rights 1689 and the claim of right act 1689 that unlike much of the rest of europe royal absolutism would not prevail and a professed catholic could never accede to the throne the british constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system 74 with the founding of the royal society in 1660 science was greatly encouraged during this period particularly in england the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies particularly in north america 75 76 though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within great britain in 1606 1667 and 1689 had proved unsuccessful the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the treaty of union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments treaty of union the treaty of union led to a single united kingdom encompassing all great britain on 1 may 1707 the united kingdom of great britain came into being the result of acts of union being passed by the parliaments of england and scotland to ratify the 1706 treaty of union and so unite the two kingdoms 77 78 79 in the 18th century cabinet government developed under robert walpole in practice the first prime minister 1721 1742 a series of jacobite uprisings sought to remove the protestant house of hanover from the british throne and restore the catholic house of stuart the jacobites were finally defeated at the battle of culloden in 1746 after which the scottish highlanders were brutally suppressed the british colonies in north america that broke away from britain in the american war of independence became the united states of america recognised by britain in 1783 british imperial ambition turned towards asia particularly to india 80 during the 18th century britain was involved in the atlantic slave trade british ships transported an estimated two million slaves from africa to the west indies parliament banned the trade in 1807 banned slavery in the british empire in 1833 and britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties the world s oldest international human rights organisation anti-slavery international was formed in london in 1839 81 82 83 union with ireland the term united kingdom became official in 1801 when the parliaments of britain and ireland each passed an act of union uniting the two kingdoms and creating the united kingdom of great britain and ireland 84 the battle of waterloo 1815 marked the end of the napoleonic wars and the start of pax britannica in the early 19th century the british-led industrial revolution began to transform the country gradually political power shifted away from the old tory and whig landowning classes towards the new industrialists an alliance of merchants and industrialists with the whigs would lead to a new party the liberals with an ideology of free trade and laissez-faire in 1832 parliament passed the great reform act which began the transfer of political power from the aristocracy to the middle classes in the countryside enclosure of the land was driving small farmers out towns and cities began to swell with a new urban working class few ordinary workers had the vote and they created their own organisations in the form of trade unions citation needed after the defeat of france at the end of the revolutionary and napoleonic wars 1792 1815 great britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century with london the largest city in the world from about 1830 85 unchallenged at sea british dominance was later described as pax britannica british peace a period of relative peace among the great powers 1815 1914 during which the british empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman 86 87 88 89 by the time of the great exhibition of 1851 britain was described as the workshop of the world 90 the british empire was expanded to include india large parts of africa and many other territories throughout the world alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies british dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions such as asia and latin america 91 92 domestically political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise during the century the population increased at a dramatic rate accompanied by rapid urbanisation causing significant social and economic stresses 93 to seek new markets and sources of raw materials the conservative party under disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in egypt south africa and elsewhere canada australia and new zealand became self-governing dominions 94 after the turn of the century britain s industrial dominance was challenged by germany and the united states 95 social reform and home rule for ireland were important domestic issues after 1900 the labour party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900 and suffragettes campaigned for women s right to vote before 1914 96 infantry of the royal irish rifles during the battle of the somme more than 885,000 british soldiers died on the battlefields of world war i britain fought alongside france russia and after 1917 the united states against germany and its allies in the first world war 1914 1918 97 british armed forces were engaged across much of the british empire and in several regions of europe particularly on the western front 98 the high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order after the war britain received the league of nations mandate over a number of former german and ottoman colonies the british empire reached its greatest extent covering a fifth of the world s land surface and a quarter of its population 99 however britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt 98 irish independence the rise of irish nationalism and disputes within ireland over the terms of irish home rule led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921 100 the irish free state became independent with dominion status in 1922 northern ireland remained part of the united kingdom 101 a wave of strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the general strike of 1926 britain had still not recovered from the effects of the war when the great depression 1929 1932 occurred this led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas as well as political and social unrest in the 1930s with rising membership in communist and socialist parties a coalition government was formed in 1931 102 britain entered the second world war by declaring war on nazi germany in 1939 after germany had invaded poland winston churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940 despite the defeat of its european allies in the first year of the war britain and its empire continued the fight alone against germany in 1940 the royal air force defeated the german luftwaffe in a struggle for control of the skies in the battle of britain urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the blitz there were also eventual hard-fought victories in the battle of the atlantic the north africa campaign and the burma campaign british forces played an important role in the normandy landings of 1944 achieved with its united states ally since world war ii map showing territories that were at one time part of the british empire with the united kingdom and its current british overseas territories and crown dependencies underlined in red after the end of the second world war in 1945 the uk was one of the big four powers along with the u s the soviet union and china who met to plan the post-war world 103 104 it was an original signatory to the declaration of the united nations the uk became one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council and worked closely with the united states to establish the imf world bank and nato 105 106 however the war left the uk severely weakened and depending financially on the marshall plan 107 in the immediate post-war years the labour government initiated a radical programme of reforms which had a significant effect on british society in the following decades 108 major industries and public utilities were nationalised a welfare state was established and a comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system the national health service was created 109 the rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with britain s now much-diminished economic position so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable independence was granted to india and pakistan in 1947 110 over the next three decades most colonies of the british empire gained their independence many became members of the commonwealth of nations 111 the uk was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal with its first atomic bomb test in 1952 but the new post-war limits of britain s international role were illustrated by the suez crisis of 1956 the international spread of the english language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture 112 113 as a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s the government encouraged immigration from commonwealth countries in the following decades the uk became a more multi-ethnic society than before 114 despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s the uk s economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as france west germany and japan leaders of member states of the european union in 2007 the uk entered the european economic community in 1973 in a referendum held in 1975 67 of voters voted to remain in the eec 115 but 52 voted to leave the eu in 2016 116 in the decade-long process of european integration the uk was a founding member of the alliance called the western european union established with the london and paris conferences in 1954 in 1960 the uk was one of the seven founding members of the european free trade association efta but in 1973 it left to join the european communities ec when the ec became the european union eu in 1992 the uk was one of the 12 founding members the treaty of lisbon was signed in 2007 which forms the constitutional basis of the european union since then from the late 1960s northern ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence sometimes affecting other parts of the uk conventionally known as the troubles it is usually considered to have ended with the belfast good friday agreement of 1998 117 118 119 following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s the conservative government of the 1980s under margaret thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism deregulation particularly of the financial sector for example big bang in 1986 and labour markets the sale of state-owned companies privatisation and the withdrawal of subsidies to others 120 this resulted in high unemployment and social unrest but ultimately also economic growth particularly in the services sector from 1984 the economy was helped by the inflow of substantial north sea oil revenues 121 around the end of the 20th century there were major changes to the governance of the uk with the establishment of devolved administrations for scotland wales and northern ireland 122 the statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the european convention on human rights the uk is still a key global player diplomatically and militarily it plays leading roles in the eu un and nato however controversy surrounds some of britain s overseas military deployments particularly in afghanistan and iraq 123 the 2008 global financial crisis severely affected the uk economy the coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits which resulted 124 in 2014 the scottish government held a referendum on scottish independence with 55 of voters rejecting the independence proposal and opting to remain within the united kingdom 125 in 2016 the united kingdom voted to leave the european union 126 the legal process of leaving the eu began on 29 march 2017 with the uk s invocation of article 50 of the treaty of lisbon formally notifying the eu of the uk s intention to leave the article stipulates that the negotiations to leave will last at least two years the uk remains a full member of the eu during this time 127 128 geography the topography of the uk the total area of the united kingdom is approximately 243,610 square kilometres 94,060 sq mi the country occupies the major part of the british isles 129 archipelago and includes the island of great britain the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of ireland and some smaller surrounding islands it lies between the north atlantic ocean and the north sea with the south-east coast coming within 22 miles 35 km of the coast of northern france from which it is separated by the english channel 130 in 1993 10 of the uk was forested 46 used for pastures and 25 cultivated for agriculture 131 the royal greenwich observatory in london is the defining point of the prime meridian 132 the united kingdom lies between latitudes 49 to 61 n and longitudes 9 w to 2 e northern ireland shares a 224-mile 360 km land boundary with the republic of ireland 130 the coastline of great britain is 11,073 miles 17,820 km long 133 it is connected to continental europe by the channel tunnel which at 31 miles 50 km 24 miles 38 km underwater is the longest underwater tunnel in the world 134 england accounts for just over half of the total area of the uk covering 130,395 square kilometres 50,350 sq mi 135 most of the country consists of lowland terrain 131 with mountainous terrain north-west of the tees-exe line including the cumbrian mountains of the lake district the pennines exmoor and dartmoor the main rivers and estuaries are the thames severn and the humber england s highest mountain is scafell pike 978 metres 3,209 ft in the lake district the skiddaw massif town of keswick and derwent water in lakeland skye is one of the major islands in the inner hebrides and part of the scottish highlands scotland accounts for just under a third of the total area of the uk covering 78,772 square kilometres 30,410 sq mi 136 and including nearly eight hundred islands 137 predominantly west and north of the mainland notably the hebrides orkney islands and shetland islands scotland is the most mountainous country in the uk and its topography is distinguished by the highland boundary fault a geological rock fracture which traverses scotland from arran in the west to stonehaven in the east 138 the fault separates two distinctively different regions namely the highlands to the north and west and the lowlands to the south and east the more rugged highland region contains the majority of scotland s mountainous land including ben nevis which at 1,343 metres 4,406 ft is the highest point in the british isles 139 lowland areas especially the narrow waist of land between the firth of clyde and the firth of forth known as the central belt are flatter and home to most of the population including glasgow scotland s largest city and edinburgh its capital and political centre although upland and mountainous terrain lies within the southern uplands wales accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the uk covering 20,779 square kilometres 8,020 sq mi 140 wales is mostly mountainous though south wales is less mountainous than north and mid wales the main population and industrial areas are in south wales consisting of the coastal cities of cardiff swansea and newport and the south wales valleys to their north the highest mountains in wales are in snowdonia and include snowdon welsh yr wyddfa which at 1,085 metres 3,560 ft is the highest peak in wales 131 wales has over 2,704 kilometres 1,680 miles of coastline 133 several islands lie off the welsh mainland the largest of which is anglesey ynys m n in the north-west northern ireland separated from great britain by the irish sea and north channel has an area of 14,160 square kilometres 5,470 sq mi and is mostly hilly it includes lough neagh which at 388 square kilometres 150 sq mi is the largest lake in the british isles by area 141 the highest peak in northern ireland is slieve donard in the mourne mountains at 852 metres 2,795 ft 131 climate the united kingdom has a temperate climate with plentiful rainfall all year round 130 the temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 11 c 12 f or rising above 35 c 95 f 142 the prevailing wind is from the south-west and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the atlantic ocean 130 although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest atlantic currents warmed by the gulf stream bring mild winters 143 especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground summers are warmest in the south-east of england being closest to the european mainland and coolest in the north heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills england scotland wales northern ireland the four countries of the united kingdom administrative divisions each country of the united kingdom has its own arrangements whose origins often pre-date the uk s formation meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the united kingdom 144 until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function 145 the organisation of local government in england is complex with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements the upper-tier subdivisions of england are the nine regions now used primarily for statistical purposes 146 one region greater london has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum 147 it was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional assemblies but a proposed assembly in the north east region was rejected by a referendum in 2004 148 below the regional tier some parts of england have county councils and district councils and others have unitary authorities while london consists of 32 london boroughs and the city of london councillors are elected by the first-past-the-post system in single-member wards or by the multi-member plurality system in multi-member wards 149 for local government purposes scotland is divided into 32 council areas with wide variation in both size and population the cities of glasgow edinburgh aberdeen and dundee are separate council areas as is the highland council which includes a third of scotland s area but only just over 200,000 people local councils are made up of elected councillors of whom there are 1,223 150 they are paid a part-time salary elections are conducted by single transferable vote in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors each council elects a provost or convenor to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area local government in wales consists of 22 unitary authorities these include the cities of cardiff swansea and newport which are unitary authorities in their own right 151 elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system 151 local government in northern ireland has since 1973 been organised into 26 district councils each elected by single transferable vote their powers are limited to services such as collecting waste controlling dogs and maintaining parks and cemeteries 152 in 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system 153 dependencies turks and caicos islands cockburn town the united kingdom has sovereignty over seventeen territories which do not form part of the united kingdom itself fourteen british overseas territories 20 and three crown dependencies 20 154 the fourteen british overseas territories are anguilla bermuda the british antarctic territory the british indian ocean territory the

south sandwich islands and akrotiri and dhekelia on the island of cyprus 155 british claims in antarctica are not universally recognised 156 collectively britain s overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 1,727,570 square kilometres 667,018 sq mi and a population of approximately 260,000 people 157 they are the last remaining remnants of the british empire and a 1999 uk government white paper stated that the overseas territories are british for as long as they wish to remain british britain has willingly granted independence where it has been requested and we will continue to do so where this is an option 158 self-determination is also enshrined into the constitutions of several overseas territories and three have specifically voted to remain under british sovereignty bermuda in 1995 159 gibraltar in 2002 160 and the falkland islands in 2013 161 the crown dependencies are possessions of the crown as opposed to overseas territories of the uk 162 they comprise three independently administered jurisdictions the channel islands of jersey and guernsey in the english channel and the isle of man in the irish sea by mutual agreement the british government manages the islands foreign affairs and defence and the uk parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf however internationally they are regarded as territories for which the united kingdom is responsible 163 the power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies with the assent of the crown privy council or in the case of the isle of man in certain circumstances the lieutenant-governor 164 since 2005 each crown dependency has had a chief minister as its head of government 165 the british dependencies use a varied assortment of currencies these include the british pound us dollar new zealand dollar euro or their own currencies which may be pegged to either locations of uk dependencies crown dependencies

islands 15 british antarctic territory politics queen elizabeth ii monarch since 1952 theresa may prime minister since 2016 the united kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy queen elizabeth ii is the monarch and head of state of the uk as well as queen of fifteen other independent commonwealth countries the monarch has the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn 166 the constitution of the united kingdom is uncodified and consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources including statutes judge-made case law and international treaties together with constitutional conventions 167 as there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and constitutional law the uk parliament can perform constitutional reform simply by passing acts of parliament and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution however no parliament can pass laws that future parliaments cannot change 168 government the uk has a parliamentary government based on the westminster system that has been emulated around the world a legacy of the british empire the parliament of the united kingdom meets in the palace of westminster and has two houses an elected house of commons and an appointed house of lords all bills passed are given royal assent before becoming law the position of prime minister note 12 the uk s head of government 169 belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of the house of commons this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber the prime minister chooses a cabinet and its members are formally appointed by the monarch to form her majesty s government by convention the monarch respects the prime minister s decisions of government 170 the palace of westminster seat of both houses of the parliament of the united kingdom the cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of the prime minister s party or coalition and mostly from the house of commons but always from both legislative houses the cabinet being responsible to both executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet all of whom are sworn into the privy council of the united kingdom and become ministers of the crown the current prime minister is theresa may who has been in office since 13 july 2016 may is also the leader of the conservative party for elections to the house of commons the uk is divided into 650 constituencies 171 each electing a single member of parliament mp by simple plurality general elections are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises prior to the fixed-term parliaments act 2011 the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 required that a new election must be called no later than five years after the previous general election 172 the conservative party the labour party and the liberal democrats formerly as the liberal party have in modern times been considered the uk s three major political parties 173 representing the british traditions of conservatism socialism and liberalism respectively 174 however in both the 2015 and 2017 general elections the scottish national party was the third-largest party by number of seats won ahead of the liberal democrats most of the remaining seats were won by parties that contest elections only in one part of the uk plaid cymru wales only and the democratic unionist party and sinn f in northern ireland only note 13 in accordance with party policy no elected sinn f in members of parliament have ever attended the house of commons to speak on behalf of their constituents because of the requirement to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch 175 devolved administrations the scottish parliament building in holyrood is the seat of the scottish parliament scotland wales and northern ireland each have their own government or executive led by a first minister or in the case of northern ireland a diarchal first minister and deputy first minister and a devolved unicameral legislature england the largest country of the united kingdom has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the uk s government and parliament on all issues this situation has given rise to the so-called west lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from scotland wales and northern ireland can vote sometimes decisively 176 on matters that affect only england 177 the 2013 mckay commission on this recommended that laws affecting only england should need support from a majority of english members of parliament 178 the scottish government and parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the uk parliament including education healthcare scots law and local government 179 in 2012 the uk and scottish governments signed the edinburgh agreement setting out the terms for a referendum on scottish independence in 2014 which was defeated 55.3 to 44.7 180 the welsh government and the national assembly for wales have more limited powers than those devolved to scotland 181 the assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through acts of the assembly which require no prior consent from westminster the northern ireland executive and assembly have powers similar to those devolved to scotland the executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the assembly 182 devolution to northern ireland is contingent on participation by the northern ireland administration in the north-south ministerial council where the northern ireland executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the government of ireland the british and irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting northern ireland through the british irish intergovernmental conference which assumes the responsibilities of the northern ireland administration in the event of its non-operation the uk does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to scotland wales or northern ireland under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty the uk parliament could in theory therefore abolish the scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly 183 184 indeed in 1972 the uk parliament unilaterally prorogued the parliament of northern ireland setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions 185 in practice it would be politically difficult for the uk parliament to abolish devolution to the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions 186 the political constraints placed upon the uk parliament s power to interfere with devolution in northern ireland are even greater than in relation to scotland and wales given that devolution in northern ireland rests upon an international agreement with the government of ireland 187 law and criminal justice the royal courts of justice of england and wales the united kingdom does not have a single legal system as article 19 of the 1706 treaty of union provided for the continuation of scotland s separate legal system 188 today the uk has three distinct systems of law english law northern ireland law and scots law a new supreme court of the united kingdom came into being in october 2009 to replace the appellate committee of the house of lords 189 190 the judicial committee of the privy council including the same members as the supreme court is the highest court of appeal for several independent commonwealth countries the british overseas territories and the crown dependencies 191 both english law which applies in england and wales and northern ireland law are based on common-law principles 192 the essence of common law is that subject to statute the law is developed by judges in courts applying statute precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles which are reported and binding in future similar cases stare decisis 193 the courts of england and wales are headed by the senior courts of england and wales consisting of the court of appeal the high court of justice for civil cases and the crown court for criminal cases the supreme court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in england wales and northern ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions 194 the high court of justiciary the supreme criminal court of scotland scots law is a hybrid system based on both common-law and civil-law principles the chief courts are the court of session for civil cases 195 and the high court of justiciary for criminal cases 196 the supreme court of the united kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under scots law 197 sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury known as sheriff solemn court or with a sheriff and no jury known as sheriff summary court 198 the scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial guilty not guilty and not proven both not guilty and not proven result in an acquittal 199 crime in england and wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995 though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66 in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015 200 according to crime statistics the prison population of england and wales has increased to 86,000 giving england and wales the highest rate of incarceration in western europe at 148 per 100,000 201 202 her majesty s prison service which reports to the ministry of justice manages most of the prisons within england and wales the murder rate in england and wales has stabilised in the first half of the 2010s with a murder rate around 1 per 100,000 which is half the peak in 2002 and similar to the rate in the 1980s 203 204 crime in scotland fell slightly in 2014 2015 to its lowest level in 39 years in with 59 killings for a murder rate of 1.1 per 100,000 scotland s prisons are overcrowded but the prison population is shrinking 205 foreign relations

partnership with france the entente cordiale and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries 207 208 the anglo-portuguese alliance is considered to be the oldest currently binding military alliance in the world the uk is also closely linked with the republic of ireland the two countries share a common travel area and co-operate through the british-irish intergovernmental conference and the british-irish council britain s global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations foreign investments official development assistance and military engagements 209

belize brunei canada cyprus diego garcia the falkland islands germany gibraltar kenya qatar and singapore 212 213 the british armed forces played a key role in establishing the british empire as the dominant world power in the 18th 19th and early 20th centuries by emerging victorious from some conflicts britain has often been able to decisively influence world events since the end of the british empire the uk has remained a major military power following the end of the cold war defence policy has a stated assumption that the most demanding operations will be undertaken as part of a coalition 214 uk military operations in bosnia kosovo afghanistan iraq and libya have followed this approach setting aside the intervention in sierra leone in 2000 the last occasion on which the british military fought alone was the falklands war of 1982 according to various sources including the stockholm international peace research institute and the international institute for strategic studies

bankers developed overwhelming advantage over those of other nations allowing the uk to dominate international trade in the 19th century 231 232 as other nations industrialised coupled with economic decline after two world wars the united kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined by degrees throughout the 20th century manufacturing remains a significant part of

annually not falling below 100 million tonnes until the early 1980s during the 1980s and 1990s the industry was scaled back considerably in 2011 the uk produced 18.3 million tonnes of coal 298 in 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171 million tons 298 the uk coal authority has stated there is a potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification ucg or fracking 299 and that based on current uk coal consumption such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years 300 however environmental and social concerns have been raised over chemicals getting into the water table and minor earthquakes damaging homes 301 302 in the late 1990s nuclear power plants contributed around 25 of total annual electricity generation in the uk but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down and ageing-related problems affect plant availability in 2012 the uk had 16 reactors normally generating about 19 of its electricity all but one of the reactors will be retired by 2023 unlike germany and japan the uk intends to build a new generation of nuclear plants from about 2018 293 the total of all renewable

people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 11th century the celts romans anglo-saxons norse and the normans welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the uk 323 a 2006 genetic study shows that more than 50 of england s gene pool contains germanic y chromosomes 324 another 2005 genetic analysis indicates that about 75 of the traceable ancestors of the modern british population had arrived in the british isles by about 6,200 years ago at the start of the british neolithic or stone age and that the british broadly share a common ancestry with the basque people 325 326 327 the uk has a history of small-scale non-white immigration with liverpool having the oldest black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the african slave trade during this period it is estimated the afro-caribbean population of great britain was 10,000 to 15,000 328 which later declined due to the abolition of slavery 329 330 the uk also has the oldest chinese community in europe dating to the arrival of chinese seamen in the 19th century 331 in 1950 there were probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in britain almost all born overseas 332 in 1951 there were an estimated 94,500 people living in britain who had been born in south asia china africa and the caribbean just under 0.2 of the uk population by 1961 this number had more than quadrupled to 384,000 just over 0.7 of the united kingdom population 333 since 1948 substantial immigration from africa the caribbean and south asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the british empire 334 migration from new eu member states in central and eastern europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups although some of this migration has been temporary 335 since the 1990s there has been substantial diversification of the immigrant population with migrants to the uk coming from a much wider range of countries than previous waves which tended to involve larger numbers of migrants coming from a relatively small number of countries 336 337 338 academics have argued that the ethnicity categories employed in british national statistics which were first introduced in the 1991 census involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and race 339 340 in 2011 87.2 of the uk population identified themselves as white meaning 12.8 of the uk population identify themselves as of one of number of ethnic minority groups 341 in the 2001 census this figure was 7.9 of the uk population 342 because of differences in the wording of the census forms used in england and wales scotland and northern ireland data on the other white group is not available for the uk as a whole but in england and wales this was the fastest growing group between the 2001 and 2011 censuses increasing by 1.1 million 1.8 percentage points 343 amongst groups for which comparable data is available for all parts of the uk level the other asian category increased from 0.4 to 1.4 of the population between 2001 and 2011 while the mixed category rose from 1.2 to 2 341 ethnic diversity varies significantly across the uk 30.4 of london s population and 37.4 of leicester s was estimated to be non-white in 2005 344 345 whereas less than 5 of the populations of north east england wales and the south west were from ethnic minorities according to the 2001 census 346 in 2016 31.4 of primary and 27.9 of secondary pupils at state schools in england were members of an ethnic minority 347 ethnic group population absolute

is now the united kingdom for over 1400 years 369 although a majority of citizens still identify with christianity in many surveys regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century 370 while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths most notably islam 371 this has led some commentators to variously describe the uk as a multi-faith 372 secularised 373 or post-christian society 374 in the 2001 census 71.6 of all respondents indicated that they were christians with the next largest faiths being islam 2.8 hinduism 1.0 sikhism 0.6 judaism 0.5 buddhism 0.3 and all other religions 0.3 375 15 of respondents stated that they had no religion with a further 7 not stating a religious preference 376 a tearfund survey in

experienced successive waves of migration the great famine in ireland then part of the united kingdom resulted in perhaps a million people migrating to great britain 387 throughout the 19th century a small population of german immigrants built up numbering 28,644 in england and wales in 1861 london held around half of this population and other small communities existed in manchester bradford and elsewhere the german immigrant community was the largest group until 1891 when it became second only to russian jews 388 england has had small jewish communities for many centuries subject to occasional expulsions but british jews numbered fewer than 10,000 at the start of the 19th century after 1881 russian jews suffered bitter persecutions and out of some 2,000,000 who left russia by 1914 around 120,000 settled permanently in britain overtaking the germans to be the largest ethnic minority from outside the british isles 389 390 the population increasing to 370,000 in 1938 391 392 393 unable to return to poland at the end of world war ii over 120,000 polish veterans remained in the uk permanently 394 after world war ii there was significant immigration from the colonies and newly independent former colonies partly as a legacy of empire and partly driven by labour shortages many of these migrants came from the caribbean and the indian subcontinent 395 in 1841 0.25 of the population of england and wales was born in a foreign country in 1901 1.5 of the population was foreign born 396 by 1931 this figure had risen to 2.6 and by 1951 it was 4.4 397 in 2014 the net increase was 318,000 immigration was 641,000 up from 526,000 in 2013 while the number of people emigrating for more than 12 months was 323,000 398 one of the more recent trends in migration has been the arrival of workers from the new eu member states in eastern europe known as the a8 countries 335 in 2010 there were 7.0 million foreign-born residents in the uk corresponding to 11.3 of the total population of these 4.76 million 7.7 were born outside the eu and 2.24 million 3.6 were born in another eu member state 399 the proportion of foreign-born people in the uk remains slightly below that of many other european countries 400 however immigration is now contributing to a rising population 401 with arrivals and uk-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 analysis of office for national statistics ons data shows that a net total of 2.3 million migrants moved to the uk in the 15 years from 1991 to 2006 402 in 2008 it was predicted that migration would add 7 million to the uk population by 2031 403 though these figures are disputed 404 the ons reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 to 239,000 405 in 2013 approximately 208,000 foreign citizens were naturalised as british citizens the highest number since records began in 1962 this figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014 between 2009 and 2013 the average number of people granted british citizenship per year was 195,800 the main countries of previous nationality of those naturalised in 2014 were india pakistan the philippines nigeria bangladesh

conducted by the migration policy institute for the equality and human rights commission suggests that between may 2004 and september 2009 1.5 million workers migrated from the new eu member states to the uk two-thirds of them polish but that many subsequently returned home resulting in a net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the uk of some 700,000 over that period 416 417 the late-2000s recession in the uk reduced the economic incentive for poles to migrate to the uk 418 the migration becoming temporary and circular 419 in 2009 for the first time since enlargement

1930 around 11.4 million people emigrated from britain and 7.3 million from ireland estimates show that by the end of the 20th century some 300 million people of british and irish descent were

northern ireland executive burrows n 1999 unfinished business the scotland act 1998 the modern law review 62 2 241 60 p 249 doi the uk parliament is sovereign and the scottish parliament is subordinate the white paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation the scottish parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority following the logic of this argument the power of the scottish parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden elliot m 2004 united kingdom parliamentary sovereignty under pressure international journal of constitutional law 2 3 545 627 553 554 doi notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes an important common factor is that the u k parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned for example the scottish parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied but this power to legislate on what may be termed devolved matters is concurrent with the westminster parliament s general power to legislate for scotland on any matter at all including devolved matters in theory therefore westminster may legislate on scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses walker g 2010 scotland northern ireland and devolution 1945 1979 journal of british studies 39 1 124 133 doi gamble a 2006 the constitutional revolution in the united kingdom publius 36 1 19 35 p 29 doi the british parliament has the power to abolish the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses but since both were sanctioned by referenda it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people in this way several of the constitutional measures introduced by the blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at westminster meehan e 1999 the belfast agreement its distinctiveness and points of cross-fertilization in the uk s devolution programme parliamentary affairs 52 1 19 31 p 23 doi the distinctive involvement of two governments in the northern irish problem means that northern ireland s new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement if this can be equated with a treaty it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between westminster and belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states although the agreement makes the general proviso that westminster s powers to make legislation for northern ireland remains unaffected without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters it may be more difficult than in scotland or wales for devolved powers to be repatriated the retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in northern ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement
