the radio times magazine we must take care there may be another war the germans will try again given another chance he also said in the same interview that the only good kraut is a dead kraut 23 however some doubt has arisen over moore s account as researchers have been unable to identify lorna despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties 24 moore said he was exceptionally close to his mother gertrude 7 a talented artist who shared his selsey home which was decorated with her paintings of bogeys little friendly aliens that she produced and sent out annually as the moores christmas cards 25 moore wrote the foreword for his mother s 1974 book mrs moore in space 26 career in astronomy edit after the war moore rejected a grant to study at the university of cambridge citing a wish to stand on my own two feet 9 he wrote his first book guide to the moon later retitled patrick moore on the moon in 1952 and it was published a year later 9 he wrote it on a 1908 woodstock typewriter which he used for every book he published 22 he was a teacher in woking and at holmewood house school in langton green 27 from 1945 to 1953 28 his second book

ancient lights though he did not wish either to be published 31 while teaching at holmewood he set up a 12 inch reflector telescope at his home which he kept into his old age 10 he developed a particular interest in the far side of the moon a small part of which is visible from earth as a result of the moon s libration the moon was his specialist subject throughout his life 10 he claimed to have discovered and named the mare orientale eastern sea in 1946 32 along with hugh percy wilkins though he later conceded that german astronomer julius heinrich franz should be credited with the discovery 33 the feature had been observed several times since telescopic observations began moore described the short-lived glowing areas on the lunar surface and gave them the name transient lunar phenomena in 1968 32 his first television appearance was in a debate about the existence of flying saucers following a spate of reported sightings in the 1950s moore argued against lord dowding and other ufo proponents 34 he was invited to present a live astronomy programme and said the greatest difficulty was finding an appropriate theme tune the opening of jean sibelius s pell as et m lisande was chosen and used throughout the programme s existence 35 the programme was originally named star map before the sky at night was chosen in the radio times 35 on 24 april 1957 at 10 30 pm moore presented the first episode about the comet arend roland 35 the programme was pitched to casual viewers up to professional astronomers in a format which remained consistent from its inception 36 moore presented every monthly episode except for one in july 2004 when he suffered a near-fatal bout of food poisoning caused by eating a contaminated goose egg and was replaced for that episode by chris lintott 37 moore appears in the guinness world records book as the world s longest-serving tv presenter having presented the programme since 1957 from 2004 to 2012 the programme was broadcast from moore s home when arthritis prevented him from travelling to the studios over the years he received many lucrative offers to take his programme onto other networks but rejected them because he held a gentlemen s agreement with the bbc 38 a highlight of the series in 1959 was when the russians allowed moore to be the first westerner to see the photographic results of the luna 3 probe and to show them live on air 39 less successful was the transmission of the luna 4 probe which ran into technical difficulties and around this time moore famously swallowed a large fly both episodes were live and moore had to continue regardless 40 he was invited to visit the soviet union where he met yuri gagarin the first man to journey into outer space 41 for the fiftieth episode of the sky at night in september 1961 moore s attempt to be the first to broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended comedy episode as cloud obscured the sky 42 patrick moore signing his book the astronomy of birr castle at nihe - 1985 in 1965 he was appointed director of the newly constructed armagh planetarium in northern ireland a post he held until 1968 43 his stay outside england was short partly because of the beginning of the troubles a dispute moore wanted no involvement in 44 he was appointed armagh county secretary of the scout movement but resigned after being informed that catholics could not be admitted 45 in developing the planetarium moore travelled to japan to secure a goto mars projector 46 he helped with the redevelopment of the birr telescope in the republic of ireland 47 he was a key figure in the development of the herschel museum of astronomy in bath 48 in june 1968 he returned to england settling in selsey after resigning his post in armagh 49 during the nasa apollo programme presenting on the apollo 8 mission he said that this is one of the great moments of human history only to have his broadcast interrupted by the children s programme jackanory 50 he was a presenter for the apollo 9 and apollo 10 missions and a commenter with cliff michelmore and james burke for bbc television s coverage of the moon landing missions 50 moore could not remember his words at the eagle has landed moment and the bbc has lost the tapes of the broadcast 51 a homemade recording reveals that the studio team was very quiet during the landing sequence leaving the nasa commentary clear of interruptions some 14 seconds after contact burke says they ve touched at 36 seconds he says eagle has landed between 53 and 62 seconds he explains the upcoming stay no-stay decision and nasa announces the t1 stay at 90 seconds after contact at 100 seconds the recorded sequence ends thus any real-time comment moore made was not broadcast live and the recording ends before burke polls the studio team for comment and reaction moore participated in tv coverage of apollo missions 12 to 17 52 patrick was the last of a lost generation a true gentleman the most generous in nature that i ever knew and an inspiration to thousands in his personal life and to millions through his 50 years of unique broadcasting it s no exaggeration to say that patrick in his tireless and ebullient communication of the magic of astronomy inspired every british astronomer amateur and professional for half a century there will never be another patrick moore but we were lucky enough to get one brian may speaking shortly after moore s death 53 he was elected a member of the international astronomical union in 1966 54 55 having twice edited the union s general assembly newsletters 56 he attempted to establish an international union of amateur astronomers which failed due to lack of interest 57 during the 1970s and 80s he reported on the voyager and pioneer programs often from nasa headquarters 58 at this time he became increasingly annoyed by conspiracy theorists and reporters who asked him questions such as why waste money on space research when there is so much to be done here he said that when asked these type of questions i know that i m dealing with an idiot 59 another question that annoyed him was what is the difference between astronomy and astrology 60 despite this he made a point of responding to all letters delivered to his house and sent a variety of standard replies to letters asking basic questions as well as those from conspiracy theorists proponents of hunting and cranks 61 despite his fame his telephone number was always listed in the telephone directory and he was happy to show members of the public his observatory 62 he compiled the caldwell catalogue of astronomical objects and in 1982 asteroid 2602 moore was named in his honour 63 in february 1986 he presented a special episode of the sky at night on the approach

subsequently rebuilt 65 moore campaigned unsuccessfully against the closure of the royal observatory greenwich in 1998 66 among moore s favourite episodes of the sky at night were those that dealt with eclipses and he said there is nothing in nature to match the glory of a total eclipse of the sun 67 moore was a bbc presenter for the total eclipse in england in 1999 though the view he and his team had from cornwall was obscured by cloud 68 moore was the patron of the south downs planetarium science centre which opened in 2001 69 moore with his co-presenter chris lintott and brian may
