has been and what will be in odin and the v lva by lorenz fr lich 1895 norse mythology is the body of myths of the north germanic people stemming from norse paganism and continuing after the christianization of scandinavia and into the scandinavian folklore of the modern period the northernmost extension of germanic mythology norse mythology consists of tales of various deities beings and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period including medieval manuscripts archaeological representations and folk tradition numerous gods are mentioned in the source texts such as the hammer-wielding humanity-protecting thunder-god thor who relentlessly fights his foes the one-eyed raven-flanked god odin who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the runic alphabet the beautiful sei r-working feathered cloak-clad goddess freyja who rides to battle to choose among the slain the vengeful skiing goddess ska i who prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore the powerful god nj r r who may calm both sea and fire and grant wealth and land the god freyr whose weather and farming associations bring peace and pleasure to humanity the goddess i unn who keeps apples that grant eternal youthfulness the mysterious god heimdallr who is born of nine mothers can hear grass grow has gold teeth and possesses a resounding horn the j tunn loki who brings tragedy to the gods by engineering the death of the goddess frigg s beautiful son baldr and numerous other deities most of the surviving mythology centers on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings such as humanity and the j tnar beings who may be friends lovers foes or family members of the gods the cosmos in norse mythology consists of nine worlds that flank a central cosmological tree yggdrasil units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings various forms of a creation myth are recounted where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being ymir and the first two humans are ask and embla these worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of ragnar k when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies and the world is enveloped in flames only to be reborn anew there the surviving gods will meet and the land will be fertile and green and two humans will repopulate the world norse mythology has been the subject of scholarly discourse since the 17th century when key texts were brought to the attention of the intellectual circles of europe by way of comparative mythology and historical linguistics scholars have identified elements of germanic mythology reaching as far back as proto-indo-european mythology in the modern period the romanticist viking revival re-awoke an interest in the subject matter and references to norse mythology may now be found throughout modern popular culture the myths have further been revived in a religious context among adherents of germanic neopaganism contents 1 sources 2 mythology 2.1 gods and other beings 2.2 cosmology 2.3 humanity 2.4 influence on the popular culture 3

futhark runic inscription that makes various references to norse mythology norse mythology is primarily attested in dialects of old norse a north germanic language spoken by the scandinavian people during the european middle ages and the ancestor of modern scandinavian languages the majority of these old norse texts were created in iceland where the oral tradition stemming from the pre-christian inhabitants of the island was collected and recorded in manuscripts this occurred primarily in the 13th century these texts include the prose edda composed in the 13th century by snorri sturluson and the poetic edda a collection of poems from earlier traditional material anonymously compiled in the 13th century 1 the prose edda was composed as a prose manual for producing skaldic poetry traditional old norse poetry composed by skalds originally composed and transmitted orally skaldic poetry utilizes alliterative verse kennings and various metrical forms the prose edda presents numerous examples of works by various skalds from before and after the christianization process and also frequently refers back to the poems found in the poetic edda the poetic edda consists almost entirely of poems with some prose narrative added and this poetry eddic poetry utilizes fewer kennings in comparison to skaldic poetry eddic poetry is relatively unadorned 1 the prose edda features layers of euhemerization a process in which deities and supernatural beings are presented as having been either actual magic-wielding human beings who have been deified in time or beings demonized by way of christian mythology 2 texts such as heimskringla composed in the 13th century by snorri and gesta danorum composed in latin by saxo grammaticus in denmark in the 12th century are the results of heavy amounts of euhemerization 3 numerous further texts such as the sagas provide further information the saga corpus consists of thousands of tales recorded in old norse ranging from icelandic family histories sagas of icelanders to migration period tales mentioning historic figures such as attila the hun legendary sagas objects and monuments such as the r k runestone and the kvinneby amulet feature runic inscriptions texts written in the runic alphabet the indigenous alphabet of the germanic peoples that mention figures and events from norse mythology 4 objects from the archaeological record may also be interpreted as depictions of subjects from norse mythology such as amulets of the god thor s hammer mj lnir found among pagan burials and small silver female figures interpreted as valkyries or d sir beings associated with war fate or ancestor cults 5 by way of historical linguistics and comparative mythology comparisons to other attested branches of germanic mythology such as the old high german merseburg incantations may also lend insight 6 wider comparisons to the mythology of other indo-european peoples by scholars has resulted in the potential reconstruction of far earlier myths 7 of the mythical tales and poems that are presumed to have existed during the middle ages viking age migration period and prior only a tiny amount of poems and tales survive 8 later sources reaching into the modern period such as a medieval charm recorded as used by the norwegian woman ragnhild tregag s convicted of witchcraft in norway in the 14th century and spells found in the 17th century icelandic galdrab k grimoire also sometimes make references to norse mythology 9 other traces such as place names bearing the names of gods may provide further information about deities such as a potential association between deities based on placement of locations bearing their names their local popularity and associations with geological features 10 mythology edit gods and other beings edit the god thor wades through a river while the sir ride across the bridge bifr st in an illustration by lorenz fr lich 1895 central to accounts of norse mythology are the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings such as with the j tnar who may be friends lovers foes or family members of the gods numerous gods are mentioned in the source texts as evidenced by records of personal names and place names the most popular god among the scandinavians during the viking age was thor who is portrayed as unrelentingly pursuing his foes his mountain-crushing thunderous hammer mj lnir in hand in the mythology thor lays waste to numerous j tnar who are foes to the gods or humanity and is wed to the beautiful golden-haired goddess sif 11 the god odin is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts one-eyed wolf and raven-flanked and spear in hand odin pursues knowledge throughout the worlds in an act of self-sacrifice odin is described as having hanged himself on the cosmological tree yggdrasil to gain knowledge of the runic alphabet which he passed on to humanity and is associated closely with death wisdom and poetry odin has a strong association with death odin is portrayed as the ruler of valhalla where valkyries carry half of those slain in battle odin s wife is the powerful goddess frigg who can see the future but tells no one and together they have a beloved son baldr after a series of dreams had by baldr of his impending death his death is engineered by loki and baldr thereafter resides in hel a realm ruled over by a goddess of the same name 12 odin must share half of his share of the dead with a powerful goddess freyja she is beautiful sensual wears a feathered cloak and practices sei r she rides to battle to choose among the slain and brings her chosen to her afterlife field f lkvangr freyja weeps for her missing husband r and seeks after him in far away lands 13 freyja s brother the god freyr is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts and in his association with weather royalty human sexuality and agriculture brings peace and pleasure to humanity deeply lovesick after catching sight of the beautiful j tunn ger r freyr seeks and wins her love yet at the price of his future doom 14 their father is the powerful god nj r r nj r r is strongly associated with ships and seafaring and so also wealth and prosperity freyja and freyr s mother is nj r r s sister her name is unprovided in the source material however there is more information about his pairing with the skiing and hunting goddess ska i their relationship is ill-fated as ska i cannot stand to be away from her beloved mountains nor nj r r from the seashore 15 together freyja freyr and nj r r form a portion of gods known as the vanir while the aesir and the vanir retain distinct identification they came together as the result of the aesir vanir war 16 while they receive less mention numerous other gods and goddesses appear in the source material for a list of these deities see list of germanic deities some of the gods heard less of include the apple-bearing goddess i unn and her husband the skaldic god bragi the gold-toothed white-skinned god heimdallr born of nine mothers the ancient god t r who lost a hand while binding the great wolf fenrir and the goddess gefjon who formed modern day zealand denmark 17 various beings outside of the gods are mentioned elves and dwarfs are commonly mentioned and appear to be connected but their attributes are vague and the relation between the two is ambiguous elves are described as radiant and beautiful whereas dwarfs often act as earthen smiths 18 a group of beings variously described as j tnar thursar and trolls in english these are all often glossed as giants frequently appear these beings may either aid deter or take their place among the gods 19 the norns d sir and aforementioned valkyries also receive frequent mention while their functions and roles may overlap and differ all are collective female beings associated with fate 20 cosmology edit the cosmological central tree yggdrasil is depicted in the ash yggdrasil by friedrich wilhelm heine 1886 s l the sun and m ni the moon are chased by the wolves sk ll and h ti in the wolves pursuing sol and mani by j c dollman 1909 the cosmology of the worlds in which all beings inhabit nine in total centers around a cosmological tree yggdrasil the gods inhabit the heavenly realm of asgard whereas humanity inhabits midgard a region in the center of the cosmos outside of the gods humanity and the j tnar these nine worlds are inhabited by beings such as elves and dwarfs travel between the worlds is frequently recounted in the myths where the gods and other beings may interact directly with humanity numerous creatures live on yggdrasil such as the insulting messenger squirrel ratatoskr and the perching hawk ve rf lnir the tree itself has three major roots and at the base of one of these roots live a trio of norns 21 elements of the cosmos are personified such as the sun s l a goddess the moon m ni a god and earth j r a goddess as well as units of time such as day dagr a god and night n tt a j tunn 22 the afterlife is a complex matter in norse mythology the dead may go to the murky realm of hel a realm ruled over by a female being of the same name may be ferried away by valkyries to odin s martial hall valhalla or may be chosen by the goddess freyja to dwell in her field f lkvangr 23 the goddess r n may claim those that die at sea and the goddess gefjon is said to be attended by virgins upon their death 24 texts also make reference to reincarnation 25 time itself is presented between cyclic and linear and some scholars have argued that cyclic time was the original format for the mythology 26 various forms of a cosmological creation story are provided in icelandic sources and references to a future destruction and rebirth of the world ragnarok are frequently mentioned in some texts 27 humanity edit according to the poetic edda poem v lusp and the prose edda the first human couple consisted of ask and embla driftwood found by a trio of gods and imbued with life in the form of three gifts after the cataclysm of ragnarok this process is mirrored in the survival of two humans from a wood l f and l f rasir from these two humankind are foretold to repopulate the new green earth 28 numerous heroes appear in norse mythology and are celebrated in a variety of poems songs and narratives within the prose and poetic edda notable humans include gylfi the first king of sweden in the gylfaginning king geirr th in the gr mnism l and two peasant children j lfi and r skva who are tricked into bondservice to thor by loki and appear in sk ldskaparm l and the gylfaginning the prose edda also describes the afterlife for humans with honourable warriors feasting and battling endlessly in valhalla while those who died dishonourably or out of battle were sent to niffelheim influence on the popular culture edit with the widespread publication of norse myths and legends at this time references to the norse gods and heroes spread into european literary culture especially in scandinavia germany and britain in the later 20th century references to norse mythology became common in science fiction and fantasy literature role-playing games and eventually other cultural products such as japanese animation traces of the religion can also be found in music and has its own genre viking metal bands such as amon amarth bathory and m negarm generally sing about norse
