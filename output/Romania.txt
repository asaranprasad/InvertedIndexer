land eara from the latin terra land current spelling ara rom neasc two spelling forms rom n and rum n were used interchangeably a until sociolinguistic developments in the late 17th century led to semantic differentiation of the two forms rum n came to mean bondsman while rom n retained the original ethnolinguistic meaning 19 after the abolition of serfdom in 1746 the word rum n gradually fell out of use and the spelling stabilised to the form rom n b tudor vladimirescu a revolutionary leader of the early 19th century used the term rum nia to refer exclusively to the principality of wallachia 20 the use of the name romania to refer to the common homeland of all romanians its modern-day meaning was first documented in the early 19th century c the name has been officially in use since 11 december 1861 21 in english the name of the country was formerly spelt rumania or roumania 22 romania became the predominant spelling around 1975 23 romania is also the official

king of dacia as depicted in cartea omului matur 1919 the human remains found in pe tera cu oase the cave with bones radiocarbon dated as being from circa 40,000 years ago represent the oldest known homo sapiens in europe 25 26 the neolithic-age cucuteni area in northeastern romania was the western region of the earliest european civilization known as the cucuteni-trypillian culture 27 also the earliest known salt works in the world is at poiana slatinei near the village of lunca in romania it was first used in the early neolithic around 6050 bc by the star evo culture and later by the cucuteni-trypillian culture in the pre-cucuteni period 28 evidence from this and other sites indicates that the cucuteni-trypillian culture extracted salt from salt-laden spring water through the process of briquetage prior to the roman conquest of dacia the territories between the danube and dniester rivers were inhabited by various thracian peoples including the dacians and the getae 29 herodotus in his work histories notes the religious difference between the getae and other thracians 30 however according to strabo the dacians and the getae spoke the same language 29 dio cassius draws attention to the cultural similarities between the two people 29 there is a scholarly dispute whether the dacians and the getae were the same people 31 32 roman incursions under emperor trajan between 101 102 ad and 105 106 ad resulted in half of the dacian kingdom becoming a province of the roman empire called dacia felix the roman rule lasted for 165 years during this period the province was fully integrated into the roman empire and a sizeable part of the population were newcomers from other provinces 33 the roman colonists introduced the latin language according to followers of the continuity theory the intense romanization gave birth to the proto-romanian language 34 35 the province was rich in ore deposits especially gold and silver in places like alburnus maior roman troops pulled out of dacia around 271 ad 36 37 the territory was later invaded by various migrating peoples 38 39 40 41 burebista decebalus and trajan are considered the romanians forefathers in romanian historiography 42 43 44 middle ages the three principalities of wallachia moldavia and transylvania under michael the brave in the middle ages romanians lived in three principalities wallachia romanian ara rom neasc the romanian land moldavia romanian moldova and in transylvania 45 the existence of independent romanian voivodeships in transylvania as early as the 9th century is mentioned in gesta hungarorum 46 but by the 11th century transylvania had become a largely autonomous part of the kingdom of hungary 47 in the other parts many small local states with varying degrees of independence developed but only under basarab i and bogdan i the larger principalities of wallachia and moldavia would emerge in the 14th century to fight the threat of the ottoman empire 48 49 writ issued on 14 october 1465 by radu cel frumos from his residence in bucharest indicating ottoman victory by 1541 the entire balkan peninsula and most of hungary had been conquered and integrated into the ottoman empire by contrast moldavia wallachia and transylvania while under ottoman suzerainty preserved partial or full internal autonomy until the mid-19th century transylvania until 1711 50 this period featured several prominent rulers such as stephen the great vasile lupu alexander the good and dimitrie cantemir in moldavia vlad the impaler mircea the elder matei basarab neagoe basarab and constantin br ncoveanu in wallachia and gabriel bethlen in the principality of transylvania as well as john hunyadi and matthias corvinus in transylvania while it was still a part of the kingdom of hungary 51 52 in 1600 all three principalities were ruled simultaneously by the wallachian prince michael the brave mihai viteazul who was considered later on the precursor of modern romania and became a point of reference for nationalists as well as a catalyst for achieving a single romanian state 53 independence and monarchy changes in romania s territory since 1859 king carol i of romania during the period of the austro-hungarian rule in transylvania and of ottoman suzerainty over wallachia and moldavia most romanians were given few rights 54 in a territory where they formed the majority of the population 55 56 nationalistic themes became principal during the wallachian uprising of 1821 and the 1848 revolutions in wallachia and moldavia the flag adopted for wallachia by the revolutionaries was a blue-yellow-red horizontal tricolour with blue above in line with the meaning liberty justice fraternity 57 while romanian students in paris hailed the new government with the same flag as a symbol of union between moldavians and wallachians 58 59 the same flag with the tricolour being mounted vertically would later be officially adopted as the national flag of romania 60 after the failed 1848 revolutions not all the great powers supported the romanians expressed desire to officially unite in a single state 61 but in the aftermath of the crimean war the electors in both moldavia and wallachia voted in 1859 for the same leader alexandru ioan cuza as domnitor ruling prince in romanian and the two principalities became a personal union formally under the suzerainty of the ottoman empire 62 following a coup d tat in 1866 cuza was exiled and replaced with prince carol i of romania of the house of hohenzollern-sigmaringen during the 1877 1878 russo-turkish war romania fought on the russian side 63 and in the aftermath it was recognized as an independent state both by the ottoman empire and the great powers by the treaty of san stefano and the treaty of berlin 64 65 the new kingdom of romania underwent a period of stability and progress until 1914 and also acquired southern dobruja from bulgaria after the second balkan war 66 world wars and greater romania a 1917 british map showing territories with majority romanian populations romania s territorial losses in the summer of 1940 of these territories only northern transylvania was regained romanian dictator ion antonescu meeting with adolf hitler in june 1941 romania remained neutral for the first two years of world war i following the secret treaty of bucharest according to which romania would acquire territories with a majority of romanian population from austria-hungary it joined the entente powers and declared war on 27 august 1916 67 after initial advances the romanian military campaign quickly turned disastrous for romania as the central powers occupied two-thirds of the country within months before reaching a stalemate in 1917 the october revolution and russian withdrawal from the war left romania alone and surrounded and a cease fire was negotiated at foc ani that december romania was occupied and a harsh peace treaty was signed in may 1918 in november romania reentered the conflict total military and civilian losses from 1916 to 1918 within contemporary borders were estimated at 748,000 68 after the war the transfer of bukovina from austria was acknowledged by the 1919 treaty of saint germain 69 of banat and transylvania from hungary by the 1920 treaty of trianon 70 and of bessarabia from russian rule by the 1920 treaty of paris 71 all cessations made to the central powers in the ceasefire and treaty were nullified and renounced 72 the following interwar period is referred as greater romania as the country achieved its greatest territorial extent at that time almost 300,000 km2 or 120,000 sq mi 73 the application of radical agricultural reforms and the passing of a new constitution created a democratic framework and allowed for quick economic growth with oil production of 7.2 million tons in 1937 romania ranked second in europe and seventh in the world 74 75 and was europe s second-largest food producer 76 however the early 1930s were marked by social unrest high unemployment and strikes as there were over 25 separate governments throughout the decade citation needed on several occasions in the last few years before world war ii the democratic parties were squeezed between conflicts with the fascist and chauvinistic iron guard and the authoritarian tendencies of king carol ii 77 during world war ii romania tried again to remain neutral but on 28 june 1940 it received a soviet ultimatum with an implied threat of invasion in the event of non-compliance 78 again foreign powers created heavy pressure on romania by means of the molotov ribbentrop pact of non-aggression from 23 august 1939 as a result of it the romanian government and the army were forced to retreat from bessarabia as well as from northern bukovina in order to avoid war with the soviet union 79 the king was compelled to abdicate and appointed general ion antonescu as the new prime minister with full powers in ruling the state by royal decree 80 romania was prompted to join the axis military campaign thereafter southern dobruja was ceded to bulgaria while hungary received northern transylvania as result of an axis powers arbitration 81 the antonescu fascist regime played a major role in the holocaust in romania 82 and copied the nazi policies of oppression and genocide of jews and roma mainly in the eastern territories reoccupied by the romanians from the soviet union in total between 280,000 and 380,000 jews in romania including bessarabia bukovina and the transnistria governorate were killed during the war 83 84 and at least 11,000 romanian gypsies roma were also killed 85 in august 1944 a coup d tat led by king michael toppled ion antonescu and his regime antonescu was convicted of war crimes and executed on 1 june 1946 86 9 october is now the national day of commemorating the holocaust in romania 87 during the antonescu fascist regime romanian contribution to operation barbarossa was enormous with the romanian army of over 1.2 million men in the summer of 1941 fighting in numbers second only to nazi germany 88 romania was the main source of oil for the third reich 89 and thus became the target of intense bombing by the allies growing discontent among the population eventually peaked in august 1944 with king michael s coup and the country switched sides to join the allies it is estimated that the coup shortened the war by as much as six months 90 even though the romanian army had suffered 170,000 casualties after switching sides 91 romania s role in the defeat of nazi germany was not recognized by the paris peace conference of 1947 92 as the soviet union annexed bessarabia and other territories corresponding roughly to present-day republic of moldova and bulgaria retained southern dobruja but romania did regain northern transylvania from hungary communism gheorghe gheorghiu-dej was the communist leader of romania from 1947 until his death in 1965 during the soviet occupation of romania the communist-dominated government called for new elections in 1946 which were fraudulently won with a fabricated 70 majority of the vote 93 thus they rapidly established themselves as the dominant political force 94 gheorghe gheorghiu-dej a communist party leader imprisoned in 1933 escaped in 1944 to become romania s first communist leader in 1947 he and others forced king michael i to abdicate and leave the country and proclaimed romania a people s republic 95 96 romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the ussr until the late 1950s during this period romania s vast natural resources were continuously drained by mixed soviet-romanian companies sovroms set up for unilateral exploitative purposes 97 98 99 in 1948 the state began to nationalize private firms and to collectivize agriculture 100 until the early 1960s the government severely curtailed political liberties and vigorously suppressed any dissent with the help of the securitate the romanian secret police during this period the regime launched several campaigns of purges in which numerous enemies of the state and parasite elements were targeted for different forms of punishment such as deportation internal exile and internment in forced labour camps and prisons sometimes for life as well as extrajudicial killing 101 nevertheless anti-communist resistance was one of the most long-lasting in the eastern bloc 102 a 2006 commission estimated the number of direct victims of the communist repression at two million people 103 nicolae ceau escu ruled romania as its communist leader from 1965 until 1989 the romanian revolution in 1989 was one of the few violent revolutions in europe that brought an end to communist rule in 1965 nicolae ceau escu came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the soviet union thus communist romania was the only warsaw pact country who refused to participate at the soviet-led 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia ceau escu even publicly condemned the action as a big mistake and a serious danger to peace in europe and to the fate of communism in the world 104 it was also the only communist state to maintain diplomatic relations with israel after 1967 s six-day war and established diplomatic relations with west germany the same year 105 at the same time close ties with the arab countries and the plo allowed romania to play a key role in the israel egypt and israel plo peace talks 106 as romania s foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 from us 3 billion to 10 billion 107 the influence of international financial organizations such as the imf and the world bank grew gradually conflicting with ceau escu s autocratic rule the latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing austerity steps that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy the process succeeded in repaying all foreign government debt of romania in 1989 at the same time ceau escu greatly extended the authority of the securitate secret police and imposed a severe cult of personality which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictator s popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution together with his wife in the violent romanian revolution of december 1989 in which thousands were killed or injured the charges for which they were executed were among others genocide by starvation contemporary period after the 1989 revolution the national salvation front nsf led by ion iliescu took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures 108 109 in april 1990 a sit-in protest contesting the results of that year s legislative elections and accusing the nsf including iliescu of being made up of former communists and members of the securitate rapidly grew to become what was called the golaniad the peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by iliescu this episode has been documented widely by both local 110 and foreign media 111 and is remembered as the june 1990 mineriad 112 113 the subsequent disintegration of the front produced several political parties including most notably the social democratic party and the democratic party the former governed romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with ion iliescu as head of state since then there have been several other democratic changes of government in 1996 emil constantinescu was elected president in 2000 iliescu returned to power while traian b sescu was elected in 2004 and narrowly re-elected in 2009 114 in november 2014 sibiu mayor klaus iohannis was elected president unexpectedly defeating prime minister victor ponta who had been in the lead in the opinion polls this surprise victory is attributed by many to the romanian diaspora of which almost 50 percent voted for iohannis in the first tour compared to 16 percent for ponta 115 romania has seen the largest anti-government protests in its history in the first half of 2017 former president traian b sescu 2004 2014 has twice been impeached by the parliament of romania in 2007 and in 2012 the second time on the background of street protest earlier in the year both times a popular referendum was called the second time in the romanian presidential impeachment referendum 2012 more than 7 million voters 88 of participants 116 voted to oust b sescu compared to the 5.2 million voters who initially supported him in the romanian presidential election 2009 however the constitutional court of romania in a split decision invalided the outcome of the referendum stating the turnout 46.24 by official statistics was too low 117 supporters of b sescu were called upon by him and his former party to not participate in the referendum so that it would be invalidated due to insufficient turnout 118 the post-1989 period is also characterized by the fact that most of the former industrial and economic enterprises which were built and operated during the communist period have been closed mainly as a result of the policies of privatization of the post-1989 regimes 119 according to valentin m ndr escu a romanian-language editor of the voice of russia the national petroleum company petrom has been sold to foreigners for significantly undervalued prices 120 121 furthermore other major privatizations like that of banca comercial a rom niei are criticized by opponents for being detrimental to the romanian people 122 post-1989 regimes are also criticized for allowing foreign exploitations of mineral rare metals and gold reserves at ro ia montan 123 as well as for permitting american multinational energy giant chevron to prospect for shale gas using the hydraulic fracking technique which has been claimed to pollute the vast underground freshwater reserves in the affected areas both these actions have led to significant protests by the population in 2012 2014 in november 2015 romania s prime minister victor ponta resigned as massive anti-corruption protests developed in the wake of the colectiv nightclub fire 124 nato and eu integration romania joined nato in 2004 and hosted its 2008 summit in bucharest after the end of the cold war romania developed closer ties with western europe and the united states eventually joining nato in 2004 and hosting the 2008 summit in bucharest 125 romania joined the european union in 2007 and signed the treaty of lisbon the country applied in june 1993 for membership in the european union and became an associated state of the eu in 1995 an acceding country in 2004 and a full member on 1 january 2007 126 during the 2000s romania enjoyed one of the highest economic growth rates in europe and has been referred at times as the tiger of eastern europe 127 this has been accompanied by a significant improvement in living standards as the country successfully reduced internal poverty and established a functional democratic state 128 129 however romania s development suffered a major setback during the late-2000s recession leading to a large gross domestic product contraction and budget deficit in 2009 130 this led to romania borrowing from the international monetary fund 131 the worsening economic conditions led to unrest and triggered a political crisis in 2012 132 romania still faces problems related to infrastructure 133 medical services 134 education 135 and corruption 136 near the end of 2013 the economist reported romania again enjoying booming economic growth at 4.1 that year with wages rising fast and a lower unemployment than in britain economic growth accelerated in the midst of government liberalisations in opening up new sectors to competition and investment most notably energy and telecoms 137 in 2016 the human development index ranked romania as a nation of very high human development 138 following the experience of economic instability throughout the 1990s and the implementation of a free travel agreement with the eu a great number of romanians emigrated to western europe and north america with particularly large communities in italy and spain in 2008 the romanian diaspora was estimated to be at over two million people 139 the cyclical nature of the world economy and economic disparities between romania and advanced european economies has fueled further emigration from the country the emigration has caused social changes in romania whereby the parents would leave for western europe to escape poverty and provide a better standard of living for their children who have been left behind some children are left to be taken care of by grandparents and relatives and some live alone if the parents deem them to be reasonably self-sufficient 140 subsequently the youth began to be called euro-orphans 141 geography and climate topographic map of romania moldoveanu peak the highest mountain of romania the rodna mountains in maramure county the
