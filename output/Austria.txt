austria stri 7 german sterreich st ra officially the republic of austria german republik sterreich help info is a federal republic and a landlocked country of over 8.8 million people 2 in central europe it is bordered by the czech republic and germany to the north hungary and slovakia to the east slovenia and italy to the south and switzerland and liechtenstein to the west the territory of austria covers 83,879 km2 32,386 sq mi the terrain is highly mountainous lying within the alps only 32 of the country is below 500 m 1,640 ft and its highest point is 3,798 m 12,461 ft 8 the majority of the population speaks local bavarian dialects of german as their native language 9 and german in its standard form is the country s official language 10 other local official languages are hungarian burgenland croatian and slovene 8 the origins of modern-day austria date back to the time of the habsburg dynasty when the vast majority of the country was a part of the holy roman empire from the time of the reformation many northern german princes resenting the authority of the emperor used protestantism as a flag of rebellion the thirty years war the influence of the kingdom of sweden and kingdom of france the rise of the kingdom of prussia and the napoleonic invasions all weakened the power of the emperor in the north of germany but in the south and in non-german areas of the empire the emperor and catholicism maintained control during the 17th and 18th centuries austria retained its position as one of the great powers of europe 11 12 and in response to the coronation of napoleon as the emperor of the french the austrian empire was officially proclaimed in 1804 following napoleon s defeat prussia emerged as austria s chief competitor for rule of a greater germany austria s defeat by prussia at the battle of k niggr tz during the austro-prussian war of 1866 cleared the way for prussia to assert control over the rest of germany in 1867 the empire was reformed into austria-hungary after the defeat of france in the 1870-71 franco-prussian war austria was excluded from the new german empire although in the following decades its politics and its foreign policy increasingly converged with those of the prussian-led empire during the 1914 july crisis that followed the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand of austria on 28 june austria-hungary emboldened by a pledge of german support on 28 july declared war on serbia because that country had not fully complied with an austrian ultimatum austria was thus the first to go to war in the july crisis which escalated into world war i after the collapse of the habsburg austro-hungarian empire in 1918 at the end of world war i austria adopted and used the name the republic of german-austria deutsch sterreich in an attempt at union with germany but this was forbidden under the treaty of versailles and the treaty of saint-germain-en-laye 1919 the name was changed to austria sterreich and shortly afterwards the first austrian republic was established in 1919 in 1938 nazi germany annexed austria in the anschluss 13 this lasted until the end of world war ii in 1945 after which germany was occupied by the allies and austria s former democratic constitution was restored in 1955 the austrian state treaty re-established austria as a sovereign state ending the occupation in the same year the austrian parliament created the declaration of neutrality which declared that the second austrian republic would become permanently neutral today austria is a parliamentary representative democracy comprising nine federal states 8 14 the capital and largest city with a population exceeding 1.8 million is vienna 8 15 other major urban areas of austria include graz linz salzburg and

founding of the nation the german name for austria sterreich meant eastern realm in old high german and is cognate with the word ostarr chi which first appears in the ostarr chi document of 996 20 this word is probably a translation of medieval latin marchia orientalis into a local bavarian dialect austria was a prefecture of bavaria created in 976 the word austria is a latinisation of the german name and was first recorded in the 12th century at the time the danube basin of austria upper and lower austria was the easternmost extent of bavaria and in fact of all the germans as at the time the territory of the former east germany was populated by slavic sorbs and polabians friedrich heer a 20th-century austrian historian stated in his book der kampf um die sterreichische identit t the struggle over an austrian identity 21 that the germanic form ostarr chi was not a translation of the latin word but both resulted from a much older term originating in the celtic languages of ancient austria more than 2,500 years ago the major part of the actual country was called norig by the celtic population hallstatt culture according to heer no- or nor- meant east or easterns whereas -rig is related to the modern german reich meaning realm accordingly norig would essentially mean the same as ostarr chi and sterreich thus austria the celtic name was eventually latinised to noricum after the romans conquered the area that encloses most of modern-day austria around 15 bc noricum later became a roman province in the mid-first century ad 22 heer s hypothesis is not accepted by linguists history venus of willendorf 28,000 to 25,000 bc museum of natural history vienna settled in ancient times 14 the central european land that is now austria was occupied in pre-roman times by various celtic tribes the celtic kingdom of noricum was later claimed by the roman empire and made a province present-day petronell-carnuntum in eastern austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the upper pannonia province carnuntum was home for 50,000 people for nearly 400 years 23 after the fall of the roman empire the area was invaded by bavarians slavs and avars 24 charlemagne king of the franks conquered the area in ad 788 encouraged colonization and introduced christianity 24 as part of eastern francia the core areas that now encompass austria were bequeathed to the house of babenberg the area was known as the marchia orientalis and was given to leopold of babenberg in 976 25 the first record showing the name austria is from 996 where it is written as ostarr chi referring to the territory of the babenberg march 25 in 1156 the privilegium minus elevated austria to the status of a duchy in 1192 the babenbergs also acquired the duchy of styria with the death of frederick ii in 1246 the line of the babenbergs was extinguished 26 as a result ottokar ii of bohemia effectively assumed control of the duchies of austria styria and carinthia 26 his reign came to an end with his defeat at d rnkrut at the hands of rudolph i of germany in 1278 27 thereafter until world war i austria s history was largely that of its ruling dynasty the habsburgs middle ages in the 14th and 15th centuries the habsburgs began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the duchy of austria in 1438 duke albert v of austria was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law emperor sigismund although albert himself only reigned for a year henceforth every emperor of the holy roman empire was a habsburg with only one exception the battle of vienna in 1683 broke the advance of the ottoman empire into europe the habsburgs began also to accumulate territory far from the hereditary lands in 1477 archduke maximilian only son of emperor frederick iii married the heiress maria of burgundy thus acquiring most of the netherlands for the family 28 29 his son philip the fair married joanna the mad the heiress of castile and aragon thus acquired spain and its italian african and new world appendages for the habsburgs 28 29 in 1526 following the battle of moh cs bohemia and the part of hungary not occupied by the ottomans came under austrian rule 30 ottoman expansion into hungary led to frequent conflicts between the two empires particularly evident in the long war of 1593 to 1606 the turks made incursions into styria nearly 20 times 31 of which some are cited as burning pillaging and taking thousands of slaves 32 in late september 1529 suleiman the magnificent launched the first siege of vienna which unsuccessfully ended according to ottoman historians with the snowfalls of an early beginning winter 17th and 18th centuries the congress of vienna met in 1814 15 the objective of the congress was to settle the many issues arising from the french revolutionary wars the napoleonic wars and the dissolution of the holy roman empire during the long reign of leopold i 1657 1705 and following the successful defence of vienna in 1683 under the command of the king of poland john iii sobieski 33 a series of campaigns resulted in bringing most of hungary to austrian control by the treaty of karlowitz in 1699 emperor charles vi relinquished many of the gains the empire made in the previous years largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the house of habsburg charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the pragmatic sanction that made his daughter maria theresa his heir with the rise of prussia the austrian prussian dualism began in germany austria participated together with prussia and russia in the first and the third of the three partitions of poland in 1772 and 1795 19th century a map showing the german confederation 1815-1836 with its 39 member states austria later became engaged in a war with revolutionary france at the beginning highly unsuccessfully with successive defeats at the hands of napoleon meaning the end of the old holy roman empire in 1806 two years earlier 34 the empire of austria was founded in 1814 austria was part of the allied forces that invaded france and brought to an end the napoleonic wars it emerged from the congress of vienna in 1815 as one of the continent s four dominant powers and a recognised great power the same year the german confederation deutscher bund was founded under the presidency of austria because of unsolved social political and national conflicts the german lands were shaken by the 1848 revolution aiming to create a unified germany 35 the various different possibilities for a united germany were a greater germany or a greater austria or just the german confederation without austria at all as austria was not willing to relinquish its german-speaking territories to what would become the german empire of 1848 the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iv in 1864 austria and prussia fought together against denmark and secured the independence from denmark of the duchies of schleswig and holstein as they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered though they fought the austro-prussian war in 1866 defeated by prussia in the battle of k niggr tz 35 austria had to leave the german confederation and subsequently no longer took part in german politics 36 37 the austro-hungarian compromise of 1867 the ausgleich provided for a dual sovereignty the austrian empire and the kingdom of hungary under franz joseph i 38 the austrian-hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various slavic groups including croats czechs poles rusyns serbs slovaks slovenes and ukrainians as well as large italian and romanian communities an ethno-linguistic map of austria hungary 1910 as a result ruling austria hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements requiring considerable reliance on an expanded secret police yet the government of austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects the reichsgesetzblatt publishing the laws and ordinances of cisleithania was issued in eight languages all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices for example a stamp which was used predominantly by the pan-german movements in the austro-hungarian empire which reads and the german spirit will once heal the world many austrians of all different social circles such as georg ritter von sch nerer promoted strong pan-germanism in hope of reinforcing an ethnic german identity and the annexation of austria to germany 39 some austrians such as karl lueger also used pan-germanism as a form of populism to further their own political goals although bismarck s policies excluded austria and the german austrians from germany many austrian pan-germans idolized him and wore blue cornflowers known to be the favourite flower of german emperor william i in their buttonholes along with cockades in the german national colours black red and yellow although they were both temporarily banned in austrian schools as a way to show discontent towards the multi-ethnic empire 40 austria s exclusion from germany caused many austrians a problem with their national identity and prompted the social democratic leader otto bauer to state that it was the conflict between our austrian and german character 41 the austro-hungarian empire caused ethnic tension between the german austrians and the other ethnic groups many austrians especially those involved with the pan-german movements desired for the reinforcement of an ethnic german identity and hoped that the empire would collapse which would subsequently allow an annexation of austria with germany 42 a lot of austrian pan-german nationalists protested passionately against minister-president kasimir count badeni s language decree of 1897 which made german and czech co-official languages in bohemia and required new government officials to be fluent in both languages this meant in practice that the civil service would almost exclusively hire czechs because most middle-class czechs spoke the german language but not the other way around the support of ultramontane catholic politicians and clergy for this reform triggered the launch of the away from rome german los-von-rom movement which was initiated by supporters of sch nerer and called on german christians to leave the roman catholic church 43 20th century archduke franz ferdinand right with his family as the second constitutional era began in the ottoman empire austria-hungary took the opportunity to annex bosnia and herzegovina in 1908 44 the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo in 1914 by bosnian serb gavrilo princip 45 was used by leading austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on serbia thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of world war i but it was not the only cause of the war which eventually led to the dissolution of the austro-hungarian empire over one million austro-hungarian soldiers died in world war i 46 on 21 october 1918 the elected german members of the reichsrat parliament of imperial austria met in vienna as the provisional national assembly for german austria provisorische nationalversammlung f r deutsch sterreich on 30 october the assembly founded the republic of german austria by appointing a government called staatsrat this new government was invited by the emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with italy but refrained from this business citation needed this left the responsibility for the end of the war on 3 november 1918 solely to the emperor and his government on 11 november the emperor advised by ministers of the old and the new governments declared he would not take part in state business any more on 12 november german austria by law declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new german republic the constitution renaming the staatsrat as bundesregierung federal government and nationalversammlung as nationalrat national council was passed on 10 november 1920 citation needed german-speaking provinces claimed by german-austria in 1918 the border of the subsequent second republic of austria is outlined in red the treaty of saint-germain of 1919 for hungary the treaty of trianon of 1920 confirmed and consolidated the new order of central europe which to a great extent had been established in november 1918 creating new states and altering others the german-speaking parts of austria which had been part of austria-hungary were reduced to a rump state named the republic of german-austria german republik deutsch sterreich 47 48 the desire for anschluss annexation of austria to germany was a popular opinion shared by all social circles in both austria and germany 49 on 12 november german-austria was declared a republic and named social democrat karl renner as provisional chancellor on the same day it drafted a provisional constitution that stated that german-austria is a democratic republic article 1 and german-austria is an integral part of the german reich article 2 50 the treaty of saint germain and the treaty of versailles explicitly forbid union between austria and germany 51 52 the treaties also forced german-austria to rename itself as republic of austria which consequently led to the first austrian republic 53 54 over 3 million german-speaking austrians found themselves living outside the new austrian republic as minorities in the newly formed or enlarged states of czechoslovakia yugoslavia hungary and italy 55 these included the provinces of south tyrol which became part of italy and german bohemia czechoslovakia the status of german bohemia sudetenland later played a role in sparking the second world war 56 the status of south tyrol was a lingering problem between austria and italy until it was officially settled by the 1980s with a great degree of autonomy being granted to it by the italian national government between 1918 and 1919 austria was known as the state of german austria staat deutsch sterreich not only did the entente powers forbid german austria to unite with germany but they also rejected the name german austria in the peace treaty to be signed it was therefore changed to republic of austria in late 1919 56 the border between austria and the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes later yugoslavia was settled with the carinthian plebiscite in october 1920 and allocated the major part of the territory of the former austro-hungarian crownland of carinthia to austria this set the border on the karawanken mountain range with many slovenes remaining in austria interwar period and world war ii after the war inflation began to devalue the krone which was still austria s currency in autumn 1922 austria was granted an international loan supervised by the league of nations 57 the purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy stabilise the currency and improve austria s general economic condition the loan meant that austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the league of nations in 1925 the schilling was introduced replacing the krone at a rate of 10,000 1 later it was nicknamed the alpine dollar due to its stability from 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing clarification needed after black tuesday the first austrian republic lasted until 1933 when chancellor engelbert dollfuss using what he called self-switch-off of parliament established an autocratic regime tending towards italian fascism 58 59 the two big parties at this time the social democrats and the conservatives had paramilitary armies 60 the social democrats schutzbund was now declared illegal but was still operative 60 as civil war broke out 58 59 61 in february 1934 several members of the schutzbund were executed 62 the social democratic party was outlawed and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated 61 on 1 may 1934 the austrofascists imposed a new constitution maiverfassung which cemented dollfuss s power but on 25 july he was assassinated in a nazi coup attempt 63 64 hitler speaking at heldenplatz vienna 1938 his successor kurt schuschnigg acknowledged austria as a german state and that austrians were better germans but wished for austria to remain independent 65 he announced a referendum on 9 march 1938 to be held on 13 march concerning austria s independence from germany on 12 march 1938 austrian nazis took over government while german troops occupied the country which prevented schuschnigg s referendum from taking place 66 on 13 march 1938 the anschluss of austria was officially declared two days later austrian-born hitler announced what he called the reunification of his home country with the rest of the german reich on vienna s heldenplatz he established a plebiscite confirming the union with germany in april 1938 parliamentary elections were held in germany including recently annexed austria on 10 april 1938 they were the final elections to the reichstag during nazi rule and took the form of a single-question referendum asking whether voters approved of a single nazi-party list for the 813-member reichstag as well as the recent annexation of austria the anschluss jews and gypsies were not allowed to vote 67 turnout in the election was officially 99.5 with 98.9 voting yes in the case of austria adolf hitler s native soil 99.71 of an electorate of 4,484,475 officially went to the ballots with a positive tally of 99.73 68 although most austrians favoured the anschluss in certain parts of austria the german soldiers were not always welcomed with flowers and joy especially in vienna which had austria s largest jewish population 69 nevertheless despite the propaganda and the manipulation and rigging which surrounded the ballot box result there was massive genuine support for hitler for fulfilling the anschluss 70 since many germans from both austria and germany saw it as completing the long overdue german unification of all germans united into one-state 71 the liberation of mauthausen concentration camp 1945 on 12 march austria was annexed to the third reich and ceased to exist as an independent country the aryanisation of the wealth of jewish austrians started immediately in mid-march with a so-called wild i e extra-legal phase but was soon structured legally and bureaucratically to strip jewish citizens of any assets they possessed the nazis renamed austria in 1938 as ostmark 66 until 1942 when it was again renamed and called alpine and danubian gaue alpen-und donau-reichsgaue 72 73 austria in 1941 when it was known as the ostmark though austrians made up only 8 of the population of the third reich 74 some of the most prominent nazis were native austrians including adolf hitler ernst kaltenbrunner arthur seyss-inquart franz stangl and odilo globocnik 75 as were over 13 of the ss and 40 of the staff at the nazi extermination camps 74 vienna fell on 13 april 1945 during the soviet vienna offensive just before the total collapse of the third reich the invading allied powers in particular the americans planned for the supposed alpine fortress operation of a national redoubt that was largely to have taken place on austrian soil in the mountains of the eastern alps however it never materialised because of the rapid collapse of the reich karl renner and adolf sch rf socialist party of austria social democrats and revolutionary socialists leopold kunschak austria s people s party former christian social people s party and johann koplenig communist party of austria declared austria s secession from the third reich by the declaration of independence on 27 april 1945 and set up a provisional government in vienna under state chancellor renner the same day with the approval of the victorious red army and backed by joseph stalin 76 the date is officially named the birthday of the second republic at the end of april most of western and southern austria were still under nazi rule on 1 may 1945 the federal constitution of 1929 which had been terminated by dictator dollfuss on 1 may 1934 was declared valid again total military deaths from 1939 to 1945 are estimated at 260,000 77 jewish holocaust victims totalled 65,000 78 about 140,000 jewish austrians had fled the country in 1938 39 thousands of austrians had taken part in serious nazi crimes hundreds of thousands died in mauthausen-gusen concentration camp alone a fact officially recognised by chancellor franz vranitzky in 1992 contemporary era the united nations office in vienna is one of the four major un office sites worldwide much like germany austria was divided into american british french and soviet zones and governed by the allied commission for austria 79 as forecast in the moscow declaration in 1943 a subtle difference was seen in the treatment of austria by the allies 76 the austrian government consisting of social democrats conservatives and communists until 1947 and residing in vienna which was surrounded by the soviet zone was recognised by the western allies in october 1945 after some doubts that renner could be stalin s puppet thus the creation of a separate western austrian government and the division of the country was avoidable austria in general was treated as though it had been originally invaded by germany and liberated by the allies 80 on 15 may 1955 after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the cold war austria regained full independence by concluding the austrian state treaty with the four occupying powers on 26 october 1955 after all occupation troops had left austria declared its permanent neutrality by an act of parliament 81 austria joined the european union in 1995 and signed the lisbon treaty in 2007 the political system of the second republic is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929 which was reintroduced in 1945 the system came to be characterised by proporz meaning that most posts of political importance were split evenly between members of the social democratic party of austria sp and the austrian people s party vp 82 interest group chambers with mandatory membership e g for workers business people farmers grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process so hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus 83 since 1945 governing via a single-party government has occurred twice 1966 1970 vp and 1970 1983 sp during all other legislative periods either a grand coalition of sp and vp or a small coalition one of these two and a smaller party ruled the country kurt waldheim an sa officer in the second world war accused of war crimes was elected president of austria from 1986 to 1992 citation needed following a referendum in 1994 at which consent reached a majority of two-thirds the country became a member of the european union on 1 january 1995 84 the major parties sp and vp have contrary opinions about the future status of austria s military nonalignment while the sp in public supports a neutral role the vp argues for stronger integration into the eu s security policy even a future nato membership is not ruled out by some vp politicians ex dr werner fasslabend ovp in 1997 in reality austria is taking part in the eu s common foreign and security policy participates in peacekeeping and peace creating tasks and has become a member of nato s partnership for peace the constitution has been amended accordingly since liechtenstein joined the schengen area in 2011 none of austria s neighbouring countries performs border controls towards it anymore politics the austrian parliament building in vienna the leopoldine wing of hofburg imperial palace in vienna home to the offices of the austrian president the parliament of austria is located in vienna the country s largest city and capital austria became a federal representative democratic republic through the federal constitution of 1920 the political system of the second republic with its nine states is based on the constitution of 1920 amended in 1929 which was reenacted on 1 may 1945 85 the head of state is the federal president bundespr sident who is directly elected by popular vote the chairman of the federal government is the federal chancellor who is appointed by the president the government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by vote of no confidence in the lower chamber of parliament the nationalrat voting for the federal president and for the parliament used to be compulsory in austria but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004 86 the parliament of austria consists of two chambers the composition of the nationalrat 183 seats is determined every five years or whenever the nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor or by nationalrat itself by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years since 2007 has voting rights while there is a general threshold of 4 for all parties at federal elections nationalratswahlen there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat or direktmandat in one of the 43 regional election districts the nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in austria however the upper house of parliament the bundesrat has a limited right of veto the nationalrat can in almost all cases ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time this is referred to as beharrungsbeschluss lit vote of persistence a convention called the sterreich -konvent 87 was convened on 30 june 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution but failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two-thirds of votes in the nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and or reform with legislative and executive the courts are the third column of austrian state powers notably the constitutional court verfassungsgerichtshof may exert considerable influence on the political system by ruling out laws and ordinances not in compliance with the constitution since 1995 the european court of justice may overrule austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the european union austria also implements the decisions of the european court of human rights since the european convention on human rights is part of the austrian constitution since 2006 federal chancellery on ballhausplatz after general elections held in october 2006 the social democratic party sp emerged as the strongest party and the austrian people s party vp came in second having lost about 8 of its previous polling 88 89 political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties in january 2007 the people s party and sp formed a grand coalition with the social democrat alfred gusenbauer as chancellor this coalition broke up in june 2008 elections in september 2008 further weakened both major parties sp and vp but together they still held 70 of the votes with the social democrats holding slightly more than the other party they formed a coalition with werner faymann from the social democrats as chancellor the green party came in third with 11 of the vote the fp and the deceased j rg haider s new party alliance for the future of austria both on the political right were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20 of the vote in the legislative elections of 2013 the social democratic party received 27 of the vote and 52 seats people s party 24 and 47 seats thus

austria as an independent and sovereign state on 26 october 1955 the federal assembly passed a constitutional article in which austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality the second section of this law stated that in all future times austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory since then austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality but rather different from the neutrality of switzerland austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of the soviet union granting overflight rights for the un-sanctioned action against iraq in 1991 and since 1995 it has developed participation in the eu s common foreign and security policy also in 1995 it joined nato s partnership for peace and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in bosnia meanwhile the only part of the constitutional law on neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is not to allow

the austrian foothills at the base of the alps and the carpathians account for around 12 and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the pannoni low country amount to about 12

of austria lies in the cool temperate climate zone where humid westerly winds predominate with nearly three-quarters of the country dominated by the alps the alpine climate is predominant in the east

winter but rather cool in summer at higher altitudes the subarctic and tundra climates seen around the alps are much warmer in winter than what is normal elsewhere due in part to the oceanic influence

on labour politics and decisions related to the expansion of the economy next to a highly developed industry international tourism is the most important part of the national economy germany has historically been the main trading partner of austria making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the german economy since austria became a member state of the european union it has gained closer ties to other eu economies reducing its economic dependence on germany in addition membership of the eu has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by austria s access to the single european market and

naturalisation ethnic groups bilingual sign of oberwart in hungarian fels r in burgenland historically austrians were regarded as ethnic germans and viewed themselves as such although this national identity was challenged by austrian nationalism in the decades after the end of world war i and even more so after world war ii 123 124 125 austria was part of the holy roman empire of the german nation until its ending in 1806 and had been part of the german confederation a loose association of 39 separate german-speaking countries until the austro-prussian war in 1866 which resulted in the exclusion of austria from the german confederation and the creation of the north german confederation led by prussia in 1871 germany was founded as a nation-state austria was not a part of it after world war i and the breakup of the austrian monarchy politicians of the new republic declared its name to be deutsch sterreich republic of german-austria and that it was part of the german republic a unification of the two countries was forbidden by the treaty of saint-germain-en-laye as one of the conditions imposed by the victorious allies of world war i upon the vanquished nation to prevent the creation of a territorially extensive german state after the events of world war ii and nazism austria as a country has made efforts to develop an austrian national identity among its populace citation needed and nowadays most do not consider themselves germans 126 however a minority of austrians still consider themselves to be germans and advocate for a greater germany arguing that the historic boundaries of the german people goes beyond the boundaries of modern-day countries especially austria and germany austrians may be described either as a nationality or as a homogeneous germanic ethnic group 127 that is closely related to neighboring germans liechtensteiners and german-speaking swiss 128 today 91.1 of the population are regarded as ethnic austrians 129 serbs form one of the largest ethnic groups in austria numbering around 300,000 people 130 131 132 historically serbian immigrants moved to austria during the time of the austro-hungarian empire when vojvodina was under imperial control following world war ii the number of serbs expanded again and today the community is very large the austrian serbian society was founded in 1936 today serbs in austria are mainly found in vienna salzburg and graz an estimated 13,000 to 40,000 slovenes in the austrian state of carinthia the carinthian slovenes as well as croats around 30,000 133 and hungarians in burgenland were recognised as a minority and have had special rights following the austrian state treaty staatsvertrag of 1955 81 the slovenes in the austrian state of styria estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000 are not recognised as a minority and do not have special rights although some believe the state treaty of 27 july 1955 states otherwise citation needed the right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where slovene and croat austrians live alongside the german-speaking population as required by the 1955 state treaty is still to be fully implemented in the view of some while others believe that the treaty-derived obligations have been met see below many carinthians are afraid of slovenian territorial claims citation needed pointing to the fact that yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two world wars and considering that some official slovenian atlases show parts of carinthia as slovene cultural territory the recently deceased governor j rg haider has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in carinthia a poll by the k rntner humaninstitut conducted in january 2006 states that 65 of carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs since the original requirements set by the state treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view another interesting phenomenon is the so-called windischen-theorie stating that the slovenes can be split in two groups actual slovenes and windische a traditional german name for slavs based on differences in language between austrian slovenes who were taught slovene standard language in school and those slovenes who spoke their local slovene dialect but went to german schools the term windische was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction this politically influenced theory dividing slovene austrians into the loyal windische and the national slovenes was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago religion religion in austria 2016 134 135 catholic church 58.8 eastern orthodox 6 protestantism 3.4 islam 7 judaism 0.1

streaming standard attendance times are 8 am to 12 pm or 1 pm with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks children are given homework daily from the first year historically there has been no lunch hour with children returning home to eat however due to a rise in the number of mothers in work primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care as in germany secondary education consists of two main types of schools attendance at which is based on a pupil s ability as determined by grades from the primary school the gymnasium caters for the more able children in the final year of which the matura examination is taken which is a requirement for access to university the hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education h here technische lehranstalt htl institution of higher technical education hak commercial academy hbla institution of higher education for economic business etc attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the matura some schools aim to combine the education available at the gymnasium and the hauptschule and are known as gesamtschulen in addition a recognition of the importance of learning english has led some gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum a portion of the lesson time being conducted in english the university of vienna the campus of the vienna university of economics and business as at primary school lessons at gymnasium begin at 8 am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon with children returning home to a late lunch older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch generally eaten at school as at primary level all pupils follow the same plan of work great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report zeugnis are a prerequisite for moving up aufsteigen to the next class pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year sitzenbleiben it is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school after completing the first two years pupils choose between one of two strands known as gymnasium slightly more emphasis on arts or realgymnasium slightly more emphasis on science whilst many schools offer both strands some do not and as a result some children move schools for a second time at age 12 at age 14 pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands or to change to a vocational course possibly with a further change of school the austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the matura examination until recently a 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as medicine in 2001 an obligatory tuition fee studienbeitrag of 363.36 per term was introduced for
