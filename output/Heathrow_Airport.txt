23 km west of central london 3 near the south end of the london borough of hillingdon on a parcel of land that is designated part of the metropolitan green belt the airport is surrounded by the villages of harlington harmondsworth longford and cranford to the north and by hounslow and hatton to the east to the south lie bedfont and stanwell while to the west heathrow is separated from slough in berkshire by the m25 motorway heathrow falls entirely under the tw postcode area as the airport is located west of london and as its runways run east west an airliner s landing approach is usually directly over the conurbation of london when the wind is from the west which is the majority of the time along with gatwick stansted luton southend and london city heathrow is one of six airports with scheduled services serving the london area although only heathrow and london city are within greater london history edit aerial photo of heathrow airport from the 1950s before the terminals were built for a chronicled history of heathrow airport see history of heathrow airport heathrow airport originated in 1929 as a small airfield great west aerodrome on land south-east of the hamlet of heathrow from which the airport takes its name at that time there were farms market gardens and orchards there there was a heathrow farm about where terminal 1 is now a heathrow hall and a heathrow house this hamlet was largely along a country lane heathrow road which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area development of the whole heathrow area as a very much larger airport began in 1944 it was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the far east but by the time the airfield was nearing completion world war ii had ended the government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport it opened as london airport in 1946 and was renamed heathrow airport in 1966 the masterplan clarification needed for the airport was designed by sir frederick gibberd who designed the original terminals and central area buildings including the original control tower and the multi-faith chapel of st george s operations edit facilities edit central waiting area in terminal 5 concorde g-boab in storage at heathrow four aircraft on the approach to heathrow runway 09l heathrow s control tower british airways aircraft at terminal 5c heathrow airport is used by over 80 airlines flying to 185 destinations in 84 countries the airport is the primary hub of british airways and is a base for virgin atlantic it has four passenger terminals numbered 2 to 5 and a cargo terminal of heathrow s 73.4 million passengers in 2014 93 were international travellers the remaining 7 were bound for or arriving from places in the uk 9 the busiest single destination in passenger numbers is new york with over 3 million passengers flying between heathrow and jfk airport in 2013 10 in the 1950s heathrow had six runways arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a hexagram with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field two of its runways would always be within 30 of the wind direction as the required length for runways has grown heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east west these are extended versions of the two east west runways from the original hexagram from the air almost all of the original runways can still be seen incorporated into the present system of taxiways north of the northern runway and the former taxiway and aprons now the site of extensive car parks is the entrance to the access tunnel and the site of heathrow s unofficial gate guardian for many years the home of a 40 scale model of a british airways concorde g-conc the site has been occupied by a model of an emirates airbus a380 since 2008 11 heathrow airport has anglican catholic free church hindu jewish muslim and sikh chaplains there is a multi-faith prayer room and counselling room in each terminal in addition to st george s interdenominational chapel in an underground vault adjacent to the old control tower where christian services take place the chaplains organize and lead prayers at certain times in the prayer room 12 the airport has its own resident press corps consisting of six photographers and one tv crew serving all the major newspapers and television stations around the world 13 most of heathrow s internal roads are initial letter coded by area n in the north e g newall road e in the east e g elmdon road s in the south e g stratford road w in the west e g walrus road c in the centre e g camborne road flight movements edit aircraft destined for heathrow are usually routed over one of four main reporting points bovingdon bnn in hertfordshire lambourne lam in essex biggin hill big in bromley and ockham ock in surrey 14 each is defined by a vor radio-navigational beacon when the airport is busy aircraft orbit in the associated hold patterns these holding areas lie to the northwest northeast southeast and southwest of the london conurbation aircraft hold between 7,000 feet and 15,000 feet at 1,000 foot intervals if these holds become full aircraft are held at more distant points before being cleared onward to one of the four main holds air traffic controllers at heathrow approach control based in swanwick hampshire then guide the aircraft to their final approach merging aircraft from the four holds into a single stream of traffic sometimes as close as 2.5 nautical miles 4.6 km 2.9 mi apart considerable use is made of continuous descent approach techniques to minimize the environmental effects of incoming aircraft particularly at night 15 once an aircraft is established on its final approach control is handed over to heathrow tower when runway alternation was introduced aircraft generated significantly more noise on departure than when landing so a preference for westerly operations during daylight was introduced which continues to this day 16 in this mode aircraft depart towards the west and approach from the east over london thereby minimizing the impact of noise on the most densely populated areas heathrow s two runways generally operate in segregated mode whereby arriving aircraft are allocated to one runway and departing aircraft to the other to further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes the use of runways 27r and 27l is swapped at 15 00 each day if the wind is from the west when landings are easterly there is no alternation 09l remains the landing runway and 09r the departure runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded cranford agreement pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed occasionally landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal reducing taxi times night-time flights at heathrow are subject to restrictions between 23 00 and 04 00 the noisiest aircraft rated qc 8 and qc 16 cannot be scheduled for operation in addition during the night quota period 23 30 06 00 there are four limits a limit on the number of flights allowed a quota count system which limits the total amount of noise permitted but allows operators to choose to operate fewer noisy aircraft or a greater number of quieter planes 17 qc 4 aircraft cannot be scheduled for operation a voluntary agreement with the airlines that no early morning arrivals will be scheduled to land before 04 30 a trial of noise relief zones ran from december 2012 to march 2013 which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out the zones used alternated weekly meaning residents in the no-fly areas received respite from aircraft noise for set periods 18 however it was concluded that some residents in other areas experienced a significant disbenefit as a result of the trial and that it should therefore not be taken forward in its current form heathrow received more than 25,000 noise complaints in just three months over the summer of 2016 but around half were made by the same ten people 19 regulation edit until it was required to sell gatwick and stansted airports heathrow airport holdings held a dominant position in the london aviation market and has been heavily regulated by the civil aviation authority caa as to how much it can charge airlines to land the annual increase in landing charge per passenger was capped at inflation minus 3 until 1 april 2003 from 2003 to 2007 charges increased by inflation plus 6.5 per year taking the fee to 9.28 per passenger in 2007 in march 2008 the caa announced that the charge would be allowed to increase by 23.5 to 12.80 from 1 april 2008 and by inflation plus 7.5 for each of the following four years 20 in april 2013 the caa announced a proposal for heathrow to charge fees calculated by inflation minus 1.3 continuing until 2019 21 whilst the cost of landing at heathrow is determined by the caa and heathrow airport holdings the allocation of landing slots to airlines is carried out by airport co-ordination limited acl 22 until 2008 air traffic between heathrow and the united states was strictly governed by the countries bilateral bermuda ii treaty the treaty originally allowed only british airways pan am and twa to fly from heathrow to the us in 1991 paa and twa sold their rights to united airlines and american airlines respectively while virgin atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes the bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the right of establishment of the united kingdom in relation to its eu membership and as a consequence the uk was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004 a new open skies agreement was signed by the united states and the european union on 30 april 2007 and came into effect on 30 march 2008 shortly afterwards additional us airlines including northwest airlines continental airlines us airways and delta air lines started services to heathrow the airport has been criticized in recent years for overcrowding and delays 23 according to heathrow airport holdings heathrow s facilities were originally designed to accommodate 55 million passengers annually the number of passengers using the airport reached a record 70 million in 2012 24 in 2007 the airport was voted the world s least favorite alongside chicago o hare in a tripadvisor survey 25 however the opening of terminal 5 in 2008 has relieved some pressure on terminal facilities increasing the airport s terminal capacity to 90 million passengers per year a tie-up is also in place with mclaren applied technologies to optimize the general procedure reducing delays and pollution 26 with only two runways operating at over 98 of their capacity heathrow has little room for more flights although the increasing use of larger aircraft such as the airbus a380 will allow some increase in passenger numbers it is difficult for existing airlines to obtain landing slots to enable them to increase their services from the airport or for new airlines to start operations 27 to increase the number of flights heathrow airport holdings has proposed using the existing two runways in mixed mode whereby aircraft would be allowed to take off and land on the same runway this would increase the airport s capacity from its current 480,000 movements per year to as many as 550,000 according to british airways ceo willie walsh 28 heathrow airport holdings has also proposed building a third runway to the north of the airport which would significantly increase traffic capacity see future expansion below 29 security edit policing of the airport is the responsibility of the aviation security unit of the metropolitan police although the army including armored vehicles of the household cavalry has occasionally been deployed at the airport during periods of heightened security full body scanners are now used at the airport and passengers who object to their use after being selected are required to submit to a hand search in a private room 30 the scanners display passengers bodies as a cartoon-style figure with indicators showing where concealed items may be 30 the new imagery was introduced initially as a trial in september 2011 following complaints over privacy 31

terminal 5 opened terminal 1 was the heathrow base for british airways ba domestic and european network and for a few of its long haul routes the acquisition of british midland international bmi in 2012 by ba s owner international airlines group meant british airways took over bmi s short-haul and medium-haul destinations from the terminal 34 terminal 1 was also the main base for star alliance members terminal 1 closed in june 2015 its site is being used for an extension to terminal 2 35 which opened in june 2014 a number of newer boarding gates used by terminal 1 had been built as part of

heathrow consolidating the airlines under star alliance s co-location policy move under one roof aer lingus eurowings flybe and icelandair also operate from the terminal the airlines moved from their original locations over a six-month period with only 10 of flights operating from there in the first six weeks united airlines transatlantic flights to avoid the opening problems seen at terminal 5 44 development will continue at the terminal to increase capacity in preparation for the closure of terminal 3 in 2019 45 the original terminal 2 opened as the europa building in 1955 and was the airport s oldest terminal it had an area of 49,654 m2 534,470 sq ft and was designed to handle around 1.2 million passengers annually in its final years it accommodated up to 8 million a total of 316 million passengers passed through the terminal in its lifetime the building was demolished in 2010 along with the queens building which had housed airline company offices 46 terminal 3 edit terminal 3 bird s-eye view terminal 3 opened as the oceanic terminal on 13 november 1961 to handle flight departures for long-haul routes for foreign carriers to the united states asia and other far eastern destinations 47 at this time the airport had a direct helicopter service to central london from the gardens on the roof of the terminal building renamed terminal 3 in 1968 it was expanded in 1970 with the addition of an arrivals building other facilities added included the uk s first moving walkways in 2006 the new 105 million pier 6 was completed 48 to accommodate the airbus a380 superjumbo emirates and qantas operate regular flights from terminal 3 using the airbus a380 redevelopment of terminal 3 s forecourt by the addition of a new four-lane drop-off area and a large pedestrianised plaza complete with canopy to the front of the terminal building was completed in 2007 these improvements were intended to improve passengers experience reduce traffic congestion and improve security 49 as part of this project virgin atlantic was assigned its own dedicated check-in area known as zone a which features a large sculpture and atrium as of 2013 terminal 3 has an area of 98,962 m2 1,065,220 sq ft and in 2011 it handled 19.8 million passengers on 104,100 flights 50 terminal 3 is home to oneworld members with the exception of iberia which uses terminal 5 malaysia airlines and qatar airways which use terminal 4 skyteam members delta air lines garuda indonesia middle east airlines and a few unaffiliated carriers terminal 4 edit terminal 4 bird s-eye view opened in 1986 terminal 4 is situated to the south of the southern runway next to the cargo terminal and is connected to terminals 2 and 3 by the heathrow cargo tunnel the terminal has an area of 105,481 m2 1,135,390 sq ft and is now home to the skyteam alliance with the exception of garuda indonesia delta air lines and middle east airlines which use terminal 3 oneworld carriers malaysia airlines and qatar airways and to most unaffiliated carriers it has undergone a 200m upgrade to enable it to accommodate 45 airlines with an upgraded forecourt to reduce traffic congestion and improve security most flights that go to terminal 4 are flights coming from asia and north africa as well as a few flights to europe an extended check-in area with renovated piers and departure lounges and a new baggage system were installed and two new stands were built to accommodate the airbus a380 etihad airways korean air malaysia airlines and qatar airways operate regular a380 flights 51 terminal 5 edit terminal 5 bird s-eye view terminal 5 lies between the northern and southern runways at the western end of the heathrow site and was opened by queen elizabeth ii on 14 march 2008 52 some 19 years after its inception it opened to the public on 27 march 2008 and british airways and its partner company iberia have exclusive use of this terminal the first passenger to enter terminal 5 was a uk ex-pat from kenya who passed through security at 04 30 on the day he was presented with a boarding pass by the british airways ceo willie walsh for the first departing flight ba302 to paris during the two weeks after its opening operations were disrupted by problems with the terminal s it systems coupled with insufficient testing and staff training which caused over 500 flights to be cancelled 53 until march 2012 terminal 5 was exclusively used by british airways as its global hub however because of the merger on 25 march iberia s operations at heathrow were moved to the terminal making it the home of international airlines group 54 built at a cost of 4.3 billion the terminal consists of a four-story main terminal building concourse a and two satellite buildings linked to the main terminal by an underground people mover transit system the second satellite concourse c includes dedicated aircraft stands for the airbus a380 it became fully operational on 1 june 2011 terminal 5 was voted skytrax world s best airport terminal 2014 in the annual world airport awards 55 the main terminal building concourse a has an area of 300,000 square metres 3,200,000 sq ft while concourse b covers 60,000 square metres 650,000 sq ft 56 it has 60 aircraft stands and capacity for 30 million passengers annually as well as more than 100 shops and restaurants 57 a further building designated concourse d and of similar size to concourse c may yet be built to the east of the existing site providing up to another 16 stands following british airways merger with iberia this may become a priority since the combined business will require accommodation at heathrow under one roof to maximise the cost savings envisaged under the deal a proposal for concourse d featured in heathrow s most recent capital investment plan the transport network around the airport has been extended to cope with the increase in passenger numbers a dedicated motorway spur links the terminal to the m25 between junctions 14 and 15 the terminal has a 3,800 space multi-story car park a more distant long-stay car park for business passengers is connected to the terminal by a personal rapid transit system which

geoff hoon announced that the british government supported the expansion of heathrow by building a third 2,200-metre 7,200 ft runway and a sixth terminal building 140 this decision followed the 2003 white paper on the future of air transport in the uk 141 and a public consultation in november 2007 142 this was a controversial decision which met with widespread opposition because of the expected greenhouse gas emissions impact on local communities as well as noise and air pollution concerns 143 prior to the 2010 general election the conservative and liberal democrat parties announced that they would prevent the construction of any third runway or further material expansion of the airport s operating capacity the mayor of london then boris johnson took the position that london needs more airport capacity favouring the construction of an entirely new airport in the thames estuary rather than expanding heathrow 144 after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power it was announced that the third runway expansion was cancelled 145 two years later leading conservatives were reported to have changed their minds on the subject 146 another proposal for expanding heathrow s capacity was the heathrow hub which aims to extend both runways to a total length of about 7,000 metres and divide them into four so that they each provide two full length runways allowing simultaneous take-offs and landings while decreasing noise levels 147 148 in july 2013 the airport submitted three new proposals for expansion to the airports commission which was established to review airport capacity in the southeast of england the airports commission was chaired by sir howard davies who at the time of his appointment was in the employ of gic private limited formerly known as government investment corporation of singapore and a member of its international advisory board gic private limited was then 2012 as it remains today one of heathrow s principal owners sir howard davies resigned these positions upon confirmation of his appointment to lead the airports commission although it has been observed that he failed to identify these interests when invited to complete the airports commission s register of interests each of the three proposals that were to be considered by sir howard davies s commission involved the construction of a third runway either to the north northwest or southwest of the airport 149 the commission released its interim report in december 2013 shortlisting three options the north-west third runway option at heathrow extending an existing runway at heathrow and a second runway at gatwick airport after this report was published the government confirmed that no options had been ruled out for airport expansion in the south-east and that a new runway would not be built at heathrow before 2015 150 the full report was published on 1 july 2015 and backed a third north-west runway at heathrow 151 reaction to the report was generally negative particularly from london mayor boris johnson one senior conservative told channel 4 howard davies has dumped an utter steaming pile of poo on the prime minister s desk 152 on 25 october 2016 the government confirmed that heathrow would be allowed to build a third runway however a final decision would not be taken until winter of 2017 18 after consultations and government votes the earliest opening year would be 2025 heathrow railway hub edit a plan to make heathrow an international railway exchange has also been proposed with the potential construction of heathrow hub railway station 153 built on a link to the high speed 2 hs2 railway line 154 this plan was confirmed to be outside the plans for both phase 1 phase 2 of the plans for hs2 in march 2015 155 airtrack edit in july 2009 heathrow airport limited submitted an application to the secretary of state for transport seeking to gain authorisation to develop a new rail link to heathrow terminal 5 to be known as heathrow airtrack 156 the rail link would address the current lack of public transport available to the south west of the airport by connecting to guildford reading and london waterloo baa stated that the scheme should add significantly to its aim of increasing the proportion of people using public transport to travel to the airport 157 in april 2011 baa announced that it was abandoning the project 158 citing the unavailability of government subsidy and other priorities for heathrow 159 such as linking to crossrail and hs2 heathrow gatwick rail link edit in late 2011 the department for transport began studying the feasibility of a high-speed rail link between gatwick and heathrow airport this rail link would form part of a plan to combine the uk s two biggest airports into a collective or virtual hub dubbed heathwick the scheme envisages a 35-mile 56 km high-speed rail route linking the two airports in fifteen minutes with trains travelling at a top speed of 180 miles per hour 290 km h parallel to the m25 and passengers passing through immigration or check-in only once 160 heathrow city edit the mayor of london s office and transport for london commissioned plans in the event of
