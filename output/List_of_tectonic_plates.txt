https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tectonic_plates list of tectonic plates from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the 15 major plates plate tectonics map from nasa this is a list of tectonic plates on the earth s surface tectonic plates are pieces of earth s crust and uppermost mantle together referred to as the lithosphere the plates are around 100 km 62 mi thick and consist of two principal types of material oceanic crust also called sima from silicon and magnesium and continental crust sial from silicon and aluminium the composition of the two types of crust differs markedly with mafic basaltic rocks dominating oceanic crust while continental crust consists principally of lower-density felsic granitic rocks contents 1 current plates 1.1 major main plates 1.2 minor plates 1.3 microplates 2 ancient continental formations 2.1 ancient supercontinents 2.2 ancient plates and cratons 2.2.1 african plate 2.2.2 antarctica plate 2.2.3 eurasian plate 2.2.4 indo-australian plate 2.2.5 north american plate 2.2.6 south american plate 3 references current plates edit geologists generally agree that the following tectonic plates currently exist on the earth s surface with roughly definable boundaries tectonic plates are sometimes subdivided into three fairly arbitrary categories major or primary plates minor or secondary plates and microplates or tertiary plates major main plates edit these plates comprise the bulk of the continents and the pacific ocean for purposes of this list a major plate is any plate with an area greater than 20 million km2 pacific plate 103,300,000 km2 north american plate 75,900,000 km2 eurasian plate 67,800,000 km2 african plate 61,300,000 km2 antarctic plate 60,900,000 km2 indo-australian plate 58,900,000 km2 often considered two plates australian plate 47,000,000 km2 indian plate 11,900,000 km2 south american plate 43,600,000 km2 minor plates edit these smaller plates are often not shown on major plate maps as the majority do not comprise significant land area for purposes of this list a minor plate is any plate with an area less than 20 million km2 but greater than 1 million km2 somali plate 16,700,000 km2 nazca plate 15,600,000 km2 philippine plate 5,500,000 km2 arabian plate 5,000,000 km2 caribbean plate 3,300,000 km2 cocos plate 2,900,000 km2 caroline plate 1,700,000 km2 scotia plate 1,600,000 km2 burma plate 1,100,000 km2 new hebrides plate 1,100,000 km2 microplates edit these plates are often grouped with an adjacent major plate on a major plate map for purposes of this list a microplate is any plate with an area less than 1 million km2 some models identify more minor plates within current orogens events that lead to a large structural deformation of the earth s lithosphere like the apulian explorer gorda and philippine mobile belt plates there may be scientific consensus as to whether such plates should be considered distinct portions of the crust thus new research could change this list 1 2 3 4 african plate lwandle plate madagascar plate rovuma plate seychelles microcontinent antarctic plate shetland plate south sandwich plate caribbean plate panama plate gon

the history of earth many tectonic plates have come into existence and have over the intervening years either accreted onto other plates to form larger plates rifted into smaller plates or have been crushed by or subducted under other plates or have done all three ancient supercontinents edit a supercontinent is a landmass consisting of multiple continental cores the following list includes the supercontinents known or speculated to have existed in the earth s past columbia euramerica gondwana kenorland laurasia nena pangaea pannotia proto-laurasia rodinia ur vaalbara ancient plates and cratons edit not all plate boundaries are easily defined especially for ancient pieces of crust the following list of ancient cratons microplates plates shields terranes and zones no longer exist as separate plates cratons are the oldest and most stable parts of the continental lithosphere and shields are the exposed area of a craton s microplates are tiny tectonic plates terranes are fragments of crustal material formed on one tectonic plate and accreted to crust lying on another plate and zones are bands of similar rocks on a plate formed by terrane accretion or native rock formation terranes may or may not have originated as independent microplates a terrane may not contain the full thickness of the lithosphere african plate edit atlantica bangweulu block zambia congo craton
