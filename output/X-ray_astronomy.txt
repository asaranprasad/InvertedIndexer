8 nm over which the earth s atmosphere is opaque x-ray astronomy is an observational branch of astronomy which deals with the study of x-ray observation and detection from astronomical objects x-radiation is absorbed by the earth s atmosphere so instruments to detect x-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons sounding rockets and satellites x-ray astronomy is the space science related to a type of space telescope that can see farther than standard light-absorption telescopes such as the mauna kea observatories via x-ray radiation x-ray emission is expected from astronomical objects that contain extremely hot gases at temperatures from about a million kelvin k to hundreds of millions of kelvin mk although x-rays have been observed emanating from the sun since the 1940s the discovery in 1962 of the first cosmic x-ray source was a surprise this source is called scorpius x-1 sco x-1 the first x-ray source found in the constellation scorpius the x-ray emission of scorpius x-1 is 10,000 times greater than its visual emission whereas that of the sun is about a million times less in addition the energy output in x-rays is 100,000 times greater than the total emission of the sun in all wavelengths based on discoveries in this new field of x-ray astronomy starting with scorpius x-1 riccardo giacconi received the nobel prize in physics in 2002 it is now known that such x-ray sources as sco x-1 are compact stars such as neutron stars or black holes material falling into a black hole may emit x-rays but the black hole itself does not the energy source for the x-ray emission is gravity infalling gas and dust is heated by the strong gravitational fields of these and other celestial objects many thousands of x-ray sources are known in addition the space between galaxies in galaxy clusters is filled with a very hot but very dilute gas at a temperature between 10 and 100 megakelvins mk the total amount of hot gas is five to ten times the total

sounding rocket flights for x-ray research were accomplished at the white sands missile range in new mexico with a v-2 rocket on january 28 1949 a detector was placed in the nose cone section and the rocket was launched in a suborbital flight to an altitude just above the atmosphere x-rays from the sun were detected by the u s naval research laboratory blossom experiment on board 1 an aerobee 150 rocket was launched on june 12 1962 and it detected the first x-rays from other celestial sources scorpius x-1 2 the largest drawback to rocket flights is their very short duration just a few minutes above the atmosphere before the rocket falls back to earth and their limited field of view a rocket launched from the united states will not be able to see sources in the southern sky a rocket launched from australia will not be able to see sources in the northern sky x-ray quantum calorimeter xqc project edit a launch of the black brant 8 microcalorimeter xqc-2 at the turn of the century is a part of the joint undertaking by the university of wisconsin-madison and nasa s goddard space flight center known as the x-ray quantum calorimeter xqc project in astronomy the interstellar medium or ism is the gas and cosmic dust that pervade interstellar space the matter that exists between the star systems within a galaxy it fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic medium the interstellar medium consists of an extremely dilute by terrestrial standards mixture of ions atoms molecules larger dust grains cosmic rays and galactic magnetic fields 3 the energy that occupies the same volume in the form of electromagnetic radiation is the interstellar radiation field of interest is the hot ionized medium him consisting of a coronal cloud ejection from star surfaces at 106-107 k which emits x-rays the ism is turbulent and full of structure on all spatial scales stars are born deep inside large complexes of molecular clouds typically a few parsecs in size during their lives and deaths stars interact physically with the ism stellar winds from young clusters of stars often with giant or supergiant hii regions surrounding them and shock waves created by supernovae inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings which leads to hypersonic turbulence the resultant structures are stellar wind bubbles and superbubbles of hot gas the sun is currently traveling through the local interstellar cloud a denser region in the low-density local bubble to measure the spectrum of the diffuse x-ray emission from the interstellar medium over the energy range 0.07 to 1 kev nasa launched a black brant 9 from white sands missile range new mexico on may 1 2008 4 the principal investigator for the mission is dr dan mccammon of the university of wisconsin balloons edit balloon flights can carry instruments to altitudes of up to 40 km above sea level where they are above as much as 99.997 of the earth s atmosphere unlike a rocket where data are collected during a brief few minutes balloons are able to stay aloft for much longer however even at such altitudes much of the x-ray spectrum is still absorbed x-rays with energies less than 35 kev 5,600 aj cannot reach balloons on july 21 1964 the crab nebula supernova remnant was discovered to be a hard x-ray 15 60 kev source by a scintillation counter flown on a balloon launched from palestine texas usa this was likely the first balloon-based detection of x-rays from a discrete cosmic x-ray source 5 high-energy focusing telescope edit the crab nebula is a remnant of an exploded star this image shows the crab nebula in various energy bands including a hard x-ray image from the heft data taken during its 2005 observation run each image is 6 wide the high-energy focusing telescope heft is a balloon-borne experiment to image astrophysical sources in the hard x-ray 20 100 kev band 6 its maiden flight took place in may 2005 from fort sumner new mexico usa the angular resolution of heft is 1.5 rather than using a grazing-angle x-ray telescope heft makes use of a novel tungsten-silicon multilayer coatings to extend the reflectivity of nested grazing-incidence mirrors beyond 10 kev heft has an energy resolution of 1.0 kev full width at half maximum at 60 kev heft was launched for a 25-hour balloon flight in may 2005 the instrument performed within specification and observed tau x-1 the crab nebula high-resolution gamma-ray and hard x-ray spectrometer hiregs edit a balloon-borne experiment called the high-resolution gamma-ray and hard x-ray spectrometer hiregs observed x-ray and gamma-rays emissions from the sun and other astronomical objects 7 8 it was launched from mcmurdo station antarctica in december 1991 and 1992 steady winds carried the balloon on a circumpolar flight lasting about two weeks each time 9 rockoons edit navy deacon rockoon photographed just after a shipboard launch in july 1956 the rockoon a portmanteau of rocket and balloon was a solid fuel rocket that rather than being immediately lit while on the ground was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon then once separated from the balloon at its maximum height the rocket was automatically ignited this achieved a higher altitude since the rocket did not have to move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel the original concept of rockoons was developed by cmdr lee lewis cmdr g halvorson s f singer and james a van allen during the aerobee rocket firing cruise of the uss norton sound on march 1 1949 1 from july 17 to july 27 1956 the naval research laboratory nrl shipboard launched eight deacon rockoons for solar ultraviolet and x-ray observations at 30 n 121.6 w southwest of san clemente island apogee 120 km 10 x-ray astronomy satellite edit x-ray astronomy satellites study x-ray emissions from celestial objects satellites which can detect and transmit data about the x-ray emissions are deployed as part of branch of space science known as x-ray astronomy satellites are needed because x-radiation is absorbed by the earth s atmosphere so instruments to detect x-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons sounding rockets and satellites x-ray telescopes and mirrors edit the swift gamma-ray burst mission contains a grazing incidence wolter i telescope xrt to focus x-rays onto a state-of-the-art ccd x-ray telescopes xrts have varying directionality or imaging ability based on glancing angle reflection rather than refraction or large deviation reflection 11 12 this limits them to much narrower fields of view than visible or uv telescopes the mirrors can be made of ceramic or metal foil 13 the first x-ray telescope in astronomy was used to observe the sun the first x-ray picture taken with a grazing incidence telescope of the sun was taken in 1963 by a rocket-borne telescope on april 19 1960 the very first x-ray image of the sun was taken using a pinhole camera on an aerobee-hi rocket 14 the utilization of x-ray mirrors for extrasolar x-ray astronomy simultaneously requires the ability to determine the location at the arrival of an x-ray photon in two dimensions and a reasonable detection efficiency x-ray astronomy detectors edit proportional counter array on the rossi x-ray timing explorer rxte satellite x-ray astronomy detectors have been designed and configured primarily for energy and occasionally for wavelength detection using a variety of techniques usually limited to the technology of the time x-ray detectors collect individual x-rays photons of x-ray electromagnetic radiation and count the number of photons collected intensity the energy 0.12 to 120 kev of the photons collected wavelength 0.008 to 8 nm or how fast the photons are detected counts per hour to tell us about the object that is emitting them astrophysical sources of x-rays edit andromeda galaxy - in high-energy x-ray and ultraviolet light released 5 january 2016 this light curve of her x-1 shows long term and medium term variability each pair of vertical lines delineate the eclipse of the compact object behind its companion star in this case the companion is a two solar-mass star with a radius of nearly four times that of our sun this eclipse shows us the orbital period of the system 1.7 days several types of astrophysical objects emit fluoresce or reflect x-rays from galaxy clusters through black holes in active galactic nuclei agn to galactic objects such as supernova remnants stars and binary stars containing a white dwarf cataclysmic variable stars and super soft x-ray sources neutron star or black hole x-ray binaries some solar system bodies emit x-rays the most notable being the moon although most of the x-ray brightness of the moon arises from reflected solar x-rays a combination of many unresolved x-ray sources is thought to produce the observed x-ray background the x-ray continuum can arise from bremsstrahlung black-body radiation synchrotron radiation or what is called inverse compton scattering of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons and atomic recombination with or without additional electron transitions 15 an intermediate-mass x-ray binary imxb is a binary star system where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole the other component is an intermediate mass star 16 hercules x-1 is composed of a neutron star accreting matter from a normal star hz herculis probably due to roche lobe overflow x-1 is the prototype for the massive x-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline 2 m between high- and low-mass x-ray binaries 17 celestial x-ray sources edit the celestial sphere has been divided into 88 constellations the international astronomical union iau constellations are areas of the sky each of these contains remarkable x-ray sources some of them have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be galaxies or black holes at the centers of galaxies some are pulsars as with sources already successfully modeled by x-ray astrophysics striving to understand the generation of x-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the sun the universe as a whole and how these affect us on earth constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation astronomy has been around for a long time physical theory changes with time with respect to celestial x-ray sources x-ray astrophysics tends to focus on the physical reason for x-ray brightness whereas x-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification order of discovery variability resolvability and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations this rosat pspc false-color image is of a portion of a nearby stellar wind superbubble the orion-eridanus superbubble stretching across eridanus and orion within the constellations orion and eridanus and stretching across them is a soft x-ray hot spot known as the orion-eridanus superbubble the eridanus soft x-ray enhancement or simply the eridanus bubble a 25 area of interlocking arcs of h emitting filaments soft x-rays are emitted by hot gas t 2 3 mk in the interior of the superbubble this bright object forms the background for the shadow of a filament of gas and dust the filament is shown by the overlaid contours which represent 100 micrometre emission from dust at a temperature of about 30 k as measured by iras here the filament absorbs soft x-rays between 100 and 300 ev indicating that the hot gas is located behind the filament this filament may be part of a shell of neutral gas that surrounds the hot bubble its interior is energized by ultraviolet uv light and stellar winds from hot stars in the orion ob1 association these stars energize a superbubble about 1200 lys across which is observed in the visual h and x-ray portions of the spectrum proposed future x-ray observatory satellites edit there are several projects that are proposed for x-ray observatory satellites see main article link above explorational x-ray astronomy edit ulysses second orbit it arrived at jupiter on february 8 1992 for a swing-by maneuver that increased its inclination to the ecliptic by 80.2 degrees usually observational astronomy is considered to occur on earth s surface or beneath it in neutrino astronomy the idea of limiting observation to earth includes orbiting the earth as soon as the observer leaves the cozy confines of earth the observer becomes a deep space explorer 18 except for explorer 1 and explorer 3 and the earlier satellites in the series 19 usually if a probe is going to be a deep space explorer it leaves the earth or an orbit around the earth for a satellite or space probe to qualify as a deep space x-ray astronomer explorer or astronobot explorer all it needs to carry aboard is an xrt or x-ray detector and leave earth orbit ulysses was launched october 6 1990 and reached jupiter for its gravitational slingshot in february 1992 it passed the south solar pole in june 1994 and crossed the ecliptic equator in february 1995 the solar x-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment grb had 3 main objectives study and monitor solar flares detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts and in-situ detection of jovian aurorae ulysses was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of mars the hard x-ray detectors operated in the range 15 150 kev the detectors consisted of 23-mm thick 51-mm diameter csi tl crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers the hard detector changed its operating mode depending on 1 measured count rate 2 ground command or 3 change in spacecraft telemetry mode the trigger level was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10 6 erg cm2 1 nj m2 when a burst trigger is recorded the instrument switches to record high resolution data recording it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from the sum of the 2 detectors there were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors taken either in 1 2 4 16 or 32 second integrations during wait mode the data were taken either in 0.25 or 0.5 s integrations and 4 energy channels with shortest integration time being 8 s again the outputs of the 2 detectors were summed the ulysses soft x-ray detectors consisted of 2.5-mm thick 0.5 cm2 area si surface barrier detectors a 100 mg cm2 beryllium foil front window rejected the low energy x-rays and defined a conical fov of 75 half-angle these detectors were passively cooled and operate in the temperature range 35 to 55 c this detector had 6 energy channels covering the range 5 20 kev x-rays from pluto theoretical x-ray astronomy edit theoretical x-ray astronomy is a branch of theoretical astronomy that deals with the theoretical astrophysics and theoretical astrochemistry of x-ray generation emission and detection as applied to astronomical objects like theoretical astrophysics theoretical x-ray astronomy uses a wide variety of tools which include analytical models to approximate the behavior of a possible x-ray source and computational numerical simulations to approximate the observational data once potential observational consequences are available they can be compared with experimental observations observers can look for data that refutes a model or helps in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data in the case of an inconsistency the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data in some cases a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model most of the topics in astrophysics astrochemistry astrometry and other fields that are branches of astronomy studied by theoreticians involve x-rays and x-ray sources many of the beginnings for a theory can be found in an earth-based laboratory where an x-ray source is built and studied dynamos edit dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating convecting and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a magnetic field this theory is used to explain the presence of anomalously long-lived magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies if some of the stellar magnetic fields are really induced by dynamos then field strength might be associated with rotation rate 20 astronomical models edit images released to celebrate the international year of light 2015 chandra x-ray observatory from the observed x-ray spectrum combined with spectral emission results for other wavelength ranges an astronomical model addressing the likely source of x-ray emission can be constructed for example with scorpius x-1 the x-ray spectrum steeply drops off as x-ray energy increases up to 20 kev which is likely for a thermal-plasma mechanism 15 in addition there is no radio emission and the visible continuum is roughly what would be expected from a hot plasma fitting the observed x-ray flux 15 the plasma could be a coronal cloud of a central object or a transient plasma where the energy source is unknown but could be related to the idea of a close binary 15 in the crab nebula x-ray spectrum there are three features that differ greatly from scorpius x-1 its spectrum is much harder its source diameter is in light-years ly s not astronomical units au and its radio and optical synchrotron emission are strong 15 its overall x-ray luminosity rivals the optical emission and could be that of a nonthermal plasma however the crab nebula appears as an x-ray source that is a central freely expanding ball of dilute plasma where the energy content is 100 times the total energy content of the large visible and radio portion obtained from the unknown source 15 the dividing line as giant stars evolve to become red giants also coincides with the wind and coronal dividing lines 21 to explain the drop in x-ray emission across these dividing lines a number of models have been proposed low transition region densities leading to low emission in coronae high-density wind extinction of coronal emission only cool coronal loops become stable changes in a magnetic field structure to that an open topology leading to a decrease of magnetically confined plasma or changes in the magnetic dynamo character leading to the disappearance of stellar fields leaving only small-scale turbulence-generated fields among red giants 21 analytical x-ray astronomy edit analytical x-ray astronomy is applied to an astronomy puzzle in an attempt to provide an acceptable solution consider the following puzzle high-mass x-ray binaries hmxbs are composed of ob supergiant companion stars and compact objects usually neutron stars ns or black holes bh supergiant x-ray binaries sgxbs are hmxbs in which the compact objects orbit massive companions with orbital periods of a few days 3 15 d and in circular or slightly eccentric orbits sgxbs show typical the hard x-ray spectra of accreting pulsars and most show strong absorption as obscured hmxbs x-ray luminosity lx increases up to 1036 erg s 1 1029 watts the mechanism triggering the different temporal behavior observed between the classical sgxbs and the recently discovered supergiant fast x-ray transients sfxt s is still debated 22 aim use the discovery of long orbits 15 d to help discriminate between emission models and perhaps bring constraints on the models method analyze archival data on various sgxbs such as has been obtained by integral for candidates exhibiting long orbits build short- and long-term light curves perform a timing analysis in order to study the temporal behavior of each candidate on different time scales compare various astronomical models direct spherical accretion roche-lobe overflow via an accretion disk on the compact object draw some conclusions for example the sgxb sax j1818.6-1703 was discovered by bepposax in 1998 identified as a sgxb of spectral type between o9i b1i which also displayed short and bright flares and an unusually very low quiescent level leading to its classification as a sfxt 22 the analysis indicated an unusually long orbital period 30.0 0.2 d and an elapsed accretion phase of 6 d implying an elliptical orbit and possible supergiant spectral type between b0.5-1i with eccentricities e 0.3 0.4 22 the large variations in the x-ray flux can be explained through accretion of macro-clumps formed within the stellar wind 22 choose which model seems to work best for sax j1818.6-1703 the analysis best fits the model that predicts sfxts behave as sgxbs with different orbital parameters hence different temporal behavior 22 stellar x-ray astronomy edit stellar x-ray astronomy is said to have started on april 5 1974 with the detection of x-rays from capella 23 a rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at capella aur during this period x-rays in the range 0.2 1.6 kev were detected by an x-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor 23 the x-ray luminosity of lx 1031 erg s 1 1024 w is four orders of magnitude above the sun s x-ray luminosity 23 stellar coronae edit coronal stars or stars within a coronal cloud are ubiquitous among the stars in the cool half of the hertzsprung-russell diagram 24 experiments with instruments aboard skylab and copernicus have been used to search for soft x-ray emission in the energy range 0.14 0.284 kev from stellar coronae 25 the experiments aboard ans succeeded in finding x-ray signals from capella and sirius cma x-ray emission from an enhanced solar-like corona was proposed for the first time 25 the high temperature of capella s corona as obtained from the first coronal x-ray spectrum of capella using heao 1 required magnetic confinement unless it was a free-flowing coronal wind 24 in 1977 proxima centauri is discovered to be emitting high-energy radiation in the xuv in 1978 cen was identified as a low-activity coronal source 26 with the operation of the einstein observatory x-ray emission was recognized as a characteristic feature common to a wide range of stars covering essentially the whole hertzsprung-russell diagram 26 the einstein initial survey led to significant insights x-ray sources abound among all types of stars across the hertzsprung-russell diagram and across most stages of evolution the x-ray luminosities and their distribution along the main sequence were not in agreement with the long-favored acoustic heating theories but were now interpreted as the effect of magnetic coronal heating and stars that are otherwise similar reveal large differences in their x-ray output if their rotation period is different 24 to fit the medium-resolution spectrum of ux ari subsolar abundances were required 24 stellar x-ray astronomy is contributing toward a deeper understanding of magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamic dynamos the release of energy in tenuous astrophysical plasmas through various plasma-physical processes and the interactions of high-energy radiation with the stellar environment 24 current wisdom has it that the massive coronal main sequence stars are late-a or early f stars a conjecture that is supported both by observation and by theory 24 young low-mass stars edit a chandra x-ray image of the cluster of newly formed stars in the orion nebula newly formed stars are known as pre-main-sequence stars during the stage of stellar evolution before they reach the main-sequence stars in this stage ages 10 million years produce x-rays in their stellar coronae however their x-ray emission is 103 to 105 times stronger than for main-sequence stars of similar masses 27 x-ray emission for pre main-sequence stars was discovered by the einstein observatory 28 29 this x-ray emission is primarily produced by magnetic reconnection flares in the stellar coronae with many small flares contributing to the quiescent x-ray emission from these stars 30 pre main sequence stars have large convection zones which in turn drive strong dynamos producing strong surface magnetic fields this leads to the high x-ray emission from these stars which lie in the saturated x-ray regime unlike main-sequence stars that show rotational modulation of x-ray emission other sources of x-ray emission include accretion hotspots 31 and collimated outflows 32 x-ray emission as an indicator of stellar youth is important for studies of star-forming regions most star-forming regions in the milky way galaxy are projected on galactic-plane fields with numerous unrelated field stars it is often impossible to distinguish members of a young stellar cluster from field-star contaminants using optical and infrared images alone x-ray emission can easily penetrate moderate absorption from molecular clouds and can be used to identify candidate cluster members 33 unstable winds edit given the lack of a significant outer convection zone theory predicts the absence of a magnetic dynamo in earlier a stars 24 in early stars of spectral type o and b shocks developing in unstable winds are the likely source of x-rays 24 coolest m dwarfs edit beyond spectral type m5 the classical dynamo can no longer operate as the internal structure of dwarf stars changes significantly they become fully convective 24 as a distributed or 2 dynamo may become relevant both the magnetic flux on the surface and the topology of the magnetic fields in the corona should systematically change across this transition perhaps resulting in some discontinuities in the x-ray characteristics around spectral class dm5 24 however observations do not seem to support this picture long-time lowest-mass x-ray detection vb 8 m7e v has shown steady emission at levels of x-ray luminosity lx 1026 erg s 1 1019 w and flares up to an order of magnitude higher 24 comparison with other late m dwarfs shows a rather continuous trend 24 strong x-ray emission from herbig ae be stars edit herbig ae be stars are pre-main sequence stars as to their x-ray emission properties some are reminiscent of hot stars others point to coronal activity as in cool stars in particular the presence of flares and very high temperatures 24 the nature of these strong emissions has remained controversial with models including unstable stellar winds colliding winds magnetic coronae disk coronae wind-fed magnetospheres accretion shocks the operation of a shear dynamo the presence of unknown late-type companions 24 k giants edit the fk com stars are giants of spectral type k with an unusually rapid rotation and signs of extreme activity their x-ray coronae are among the most luminous lx 1032 erg s 1 or 1025 w and the hottest known with dominant temperatures up to 40 mk 24 however the current popular hypothesis involves a merger of a close binary system in which the orbital angular momentum of the companion is transferred to the primary 24 pollux is the brightest star in the constellation gemini despite its beta designation and the 17th brightest in the sky pollux is a giant orange k star that makes an interesting color contrast with its white twin castor evidence has been found for a hot outer magnetically supported corona around pollux and the star is known to be an x-ray emitter 34 eta carinae edit classified as a peculiar star eta carinae exhibits a superstar at its center as seen in this image from chandra x-ray observatory credit chandra science center and nasa new x-ray observations by the chandra x-ray observatory show three distinct structures an outer horseshoe-shaped ring about 2 light years in diameter a hot inner core about 3 light-months in diameter and a hot central source less than 1 light-month in diameter which may contain the superstar that drives the whole show the outer ring provides evidence of another large explosion that occurred over 1,000 years ago these three structures around eta carinae are thought to represent shock waves produced by matter rushing away from the superstar at supersonic speeds the temperature of the shock-heated gas ranges from 60 mk in the central regions to 3 mk on the horseshoe-shaped outer structure the chandra image contains some puzzles for existing ideas of how a star can produce such hot and intense x-rays says prof kris davidson of the university of minnesota 35 davidson is principal investigator for the eta carina observations by the hubble space telescope in the most popular theory x-rays are made by colliding gas streams from two stars so close together that they d look like a point source to us but what happens to gas streams that escape to farther distances the extended hot stuff in the middle of the new image gives demanding new conditions for any theory to meet 35 amateur x-ray astronomy edit collectively amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves the united states air force academy usafa is the home of the us s only undergraduate satellite program and has and continues to develop the falconlaunch sounding rockets 36 in addition to any direct amateur efforts to put x-ray astronomy payloads into space there are opportunities that allow student-developed experimental payloads to be put on board commercial sounding rockets as a free-of-charge ride 37 there are major limitations to amateurs observing and reporting experiments in x-ray astronomy the cost of building an amateur rocket or balloon to place a detector high enough and the cost of appropriate parts to build a suitable x-ray detector history of x-ray astronomy edit nrl scientists j d purcell c y johnson and dr f s johnson are among those recovering instruments from a v-2 used for upper atmospheric research above the new mexico desert this is v-2 number 54 launched january 18 1951 photo by dr richard tousey nrl in 1927 e o hulburt of the us naval research laboratory and associates gregory breit and merle a tuve of the carnegie institution of washington explored the possibility of equipping robert h goddard s rockets to explore the upper atmosphere two years later he proposed an experimental program in which a rocket might be instrumented to explore the upper atmosphere including detection of ultraviolet radiation and x-rays at high altitudes 38 in the late 1930s the presence of a very hot tenuous gas surrounding the sun was inferred indirectly from optical coronal lines of highly ionized species 24 the sun has been known to be surrounded by a hot tenuous corona 39 in the mid-1940s radio observations revealed a radio corona around the sun 24 the beginning of the search for x-ray sources from above the earth s atmosphere was on august 5 1948 12 07 gmt a us army formerly german v-2 rocket as part of project hermes was launched from white sands proving grounds the first solar x-rays were recorded by t burnight 40 through the 1960s 70s 80s and 90s the sensitivity of detectors increased greatly during the 60 years of x-ray astronomy in addition the ability to focus x-rays has developed enormously allowing the production of high-quality images of many fascinating celestial objects major questions in x-ray astronomy edit as x-ray astronomy uses a major spectral probe to peer into source it is a valuable tool in efforts to understand many puzzles stellar magnetic fields edit magnetic fields are ubiquitous among stars yet we do not understand precisely why nor have we fully understood the bewildering variety of plasma physical mechanisms that act in stellar environments 24 some stars for example seem to have magnetic fields fossil stellar magnetic fields left over from their period of formation while others seem to generate the field anew frequently extrasolar x-ray source astrometry edit with the initial detection of an extrasolar x-ray source the first question usually asked is what is the source an extensive search is often made in other wavelengths such as visible or radio for possible coincident objects many of the verified x-ray locations still do not have readily discernible sources x-ray astrometry becomes a serious concern that results in ever greater demands for finer angular resolution and spectral radiance there are inherent difficulties in making x-ray optical x-ray radio and x-ray x-ray identifications based solely on positional coincidents especially with handicaps in making identifications such as the large uncertainties in positional determinants made from balloons and rockets poor source separation in the crowded region toward the galactic center source variability and the multiplicity of source nomenclature 41 x ray source counterparts to stars can be identified by calculating the angular separation between source centroids and position of the star the maximum allowable separation is a compromise between a larger value to identify as many real matches as possible and a smaller value to minimize the probability of spurious matches an adopted matching criterion of 40 finds nearly all possible x ray source matches while keeping the probability of any spurious matches in the sample to 3 42 solar x-ray astronomy edit all of the detected x-ray sources at around or near the sun appear to be associated with processes in the corona which is its outer atmosphere coronal heating problem edit in the area of solar x-ray astronomy there is the coronal heating problem the photosphere of the sun has an effective temperature of 5,570 k 43 yet its corona has an average temperature of 1 2 106 k 44 however the hottest regions are 8 20 106 k 44 the high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere 45 it is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating 44 the first is wave heating in which sound gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone 44 these waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona depositing their energy in the ambient gas in the form of heat 46 the other is magnetic heating in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events nanoflares 47 currently it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism all waves except alfv n waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona 48 in addition alfv n waves do not easily dissipate in the corona current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms 44 coronal mass ejection edit a coronal mass ejection cme is an ejected plasma consisting primarily of electrons and protons in addition to small quantities of heavier elements such as helium oxygen and iron plus the entraining coronal closed magnetic field regions evolution of these closed magnetic structures in response to various photospheric motions over different time scales convection differential rotation meridional circulation somehow leads to the cme 49 small-scale energetic signatures such as plasma heating observed as compact soft x-ray brightening may be indicative of impending cmes the soft x-ray sigmoid an s-shaped intensity of soft x-rays is an observational manifestation of the connection between coronal structure and cme production 49 relating the sigmoids at x-ray and other wavelengths to magnetic structures and current systems in the solar atmosphere is the key to understanding their relationship to cmes 49 the first detection of a coronal mass ejection cme as such was made on december 1 1971 by r tousey of the us naval research laboratory using oso 7 50 earlier observations of coronal transients or even phenomena observed visually during solar eclipses are now understood as essentially the same thing the largest geomagnetic perturbation resulting presumably from a prehistoric cme coincided with the first-observed solar flare in 1859 the flare was observed visually by richard christopher carrington and the geomagnetic storm was observed with the recording magnetograph at kew gardens the same instrument recorded a crotchet an instantaneous perturbation of the earth s ionosphere by ionizing soft x-rays this could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of x-rays by roentgen and the recognition of the ionosphere by kennelly and heaviside exotic x-ray sources edit a microquasar is a smaller cousin of a quasar that is a radio emitting x-ray binary with an often resolvable pair of radio jets lsi 61 303 is a periodic radio-emitting binary system that is also the gamma-ray source cg135 01 observations are revealing a growing number of recurrent x-ray transients characterized by short outbursts with very fast rise times tens of minutes and typical durations of a few hours that are associated with ob supergiants and hence define a new class of massive x-ray binaries supergiant fast x-ray transients sfxts observations made by chandra indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot x-ray emitting gas that surrounds messier 87 a magnetar is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field the decay of which powers the emission of copious amounts of high-energy electromagnetic radiation particularly x-rays and gamma rays x-ray dark stars edit a solar cycle a montage of ten years worth of yohkoh sxt images demonstrating the variation in solar activity during a sunspot cycle from after august 30 1991 at the peak of cycle 22 to september 6 2001 at the peak of cycle 23 credit the yohkoh mission of institute of space and astronautical science isas japan and nasa us during the solar cycle as shown in the sequence of images at right at times the sun is almost x-ray dark almost an x-ray variable betelgeuse on the other hand appears to be always x-ray dark hardly any x-rays are emitted by red giants there is a rather abrupt onset of x-ray emission around spectral type a7-f0 with a large range of luminosities developing across spectral class f altair is spectral type a7v and vega is a0v altair s total x-ray luminosity is at least an order of magnitude larger than the x-ray luminosity for vega the outer convection zone of early f stars is expected to be very shallow and absent in a-type dwarfs yet the acoustic flux from the interior reaches a maximum for late a and early f stars provoking investigations of magnetic activity in a-type stars along three principal lines chemically peculiar stars of spectral type bp or ap are appreciable magnetic radio sources most bp ap stars remain undetected and of those reported early on as producing x-rays only few of them can be identified as probably single stars x-ray observations offer the possibility to detect x-ray dark planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area x-ray dark planet comet edit x-ray observations offer the possibility to detect x-ray dark planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area 24 as x-ray detectors have become more sensitive they have observed that some planets and other normally x-ray non-luminescent celestial objects under certain conditions emit fluoresce or reflect x-rays comet lulin edit image of comet lulin on 28 january 2009 when the comet was 99.5 million miles from earth and 115.3 million miles from the sun from swift data from swift s ultraviolet optical telescope is shown in blue and green and from its x-ray telescope in red nasa s swift gamma-ray burst mission satellite was monitoring comet lulin as it closed to 63 gm of earth for the first time astronomers can see simultaneous uv and x-ray images of a comet the solar wind a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun interacts with the comet s broader cloud of atoms this causes the solar wind to light up with x-rays and that s what swift s xrt sees said stefan immler of the goddard space flight center this interaction called charge exchange results in x-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times earth s distance from the sun because lulin is so active its atomic cloud is especially dense as a result the x-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet 51 see also edit book astronomy balloons for x-ray astronomy crab unit gamma-ray astronomy history of x-ray astronomy list
