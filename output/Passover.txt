pesakh is an important biblically derived jewish holiday jews celebrate passover as a commemoration of their liberation by god from slavery in ancient egypt and their freedom as a nation under the leadership of moses it commemorates the story of the exodus as described in the hebrew bible especially in the book of exodus in which the israelites were freed from slavery in egypt according to standard biblical chronology this event would have taken place at about 1300 bce am 2450 5 passover is a spring festival which during the existence of the temple in jerusalem was connected to the offering of the first-fruits of the barley barley being the first grain to ripen and to be harvested in the land of israel 6 passover commences on the 15th of the hebrew month of nisan and lasts for either seven days in israel and for reform jews and other progressive jews around the world who adhere to the biblical commandment or eight days for orthodox hasidic and most conservative jews in the diaspora 7 8 in judaism a day commences at dusk and lasts until the following dusk thus the first day of passover begins after dusk of the 14th of nisan and ends at dusk of the 15th day of the month of nisan the rituals unique to the passover celebrations commence with the passover seder when the 15th of nisan has begun in the northern hemisphere passover takes place in spring as the torah prescribes it in the month of the spring it is one of the most widely celebrated jewish holidays in the narrative of the exodus the bible tells that god helped the children of israel escape from their slavery in egypt by inflicting ten plagues upon the ancient egyptians before the pharaoh would release his israelite slaves the tenth and worst of the plagues was the death of the egyptian first-born the israelites were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a slaughtered spring lamb and upon seeing this the spirit of the lord knew to pass over the first-born in these homes hence the english name of the holiday 9 when the pharaoh freed the israelites it is said that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise leaven in commemoration for the duration of passover no leavened bread is eaten for which reason passover was called the feast of unleavened bread in the torah or old testament 10 thus matzo flat unleavened bread is eaten during passover and it is a tradition of the holiday historically together with shavuot pentecost and sukkot tabernacles passover is one of the three pilgrimage festivals shalosh regalim during which the entire population of the kingdom of judah made a pilgrimage to the temple in jerusalem 11 samaritans still make this pilgrimage to mount gerizim but only men participate in public worship 12 13

falls in march or april of the gregorian calendar passover is a spring festival so the 15th day of nisan typically begins on the night of a full moon after the northern vernal equinox 14 however due to intercalary months or leap months falling after the vernal equinox passover sometimes starts on the second full moon after vernal equinox as in 2016 to ensure that passover did not start before spring the tradition in ancient israel held that the first day of nisan would not start until the barley was ripe being the test for the onset of spring 15 if the barley was not ripe or various other phenomena 16 indicated that spring was not yet imminent an intercalary month adar ii would be added however since at least the 4th century the date has been fixed mathematically 17 in israel passover is the seven-day holiday of the feast of unleavened bread with the first and last days celebrated as legal holidays and as holy days involving holiday meals special prayer services and abstention from work the intervening days are known as chol hamoed weekdays of the festival diaspora jews historically celebrated the festival for eight days reform and reconstructionist jews and israeli jews wherever they are usually celebrate the holiday over seven days the reason for this extra day is due to enactment of the ancient jewish sages citation needed it is thought by many scholars that jews outside of israel could not be certain if their local calendars fully conformed to practice of the temple at jerusalem so they added an extra day but as this practice attaches only to certain major sacred days others posit the extra day may have been added to accommodate people who had to travel long distances to participate in communal worship and ritual practices or the practice may have evolved as a compromise between conflicting interpretations of jewish law regarding the calendar or it may have evolved as a safety measure in areas where jews were commonly in danger so that their enemies would not be certain on which day to attack 18 karaites and samaritans use different versions of the jewish calendar which are often out of sync with the modern jewish calendar by one or two days 19 in 2009 for example nisan 15 on the jewish calendar used by rabbinic judaism corresponds to april 9 on the calendars used by karaites and samaritans abib or aviv 15 as opposed to nisan corresponds to april 11 in 2009 the karaite and samaritan passovers are each one day long followed by the six-day festival of unleavened bread for a total of seven days 20 origins and biblical development illustration of the exodus from egypt 1907 the origins of the passover festival antedate the exodus 21 the passover ritual prior to deuteronomy is widely thought to have its origins in an apotropaic rite unrelated to the exodus to ensure the protection of a family home a rite conducted wholly within a clan hyssop was employed to daub the blood of a slaughtered sheep on the lintels and door posts to ensure that demonic forces could not enter the home 22 a further hypothesis maintains that once the priestly code was promulgated the exodus narrative took on a central function as the apotropaic rite was arguably amalgamated with the canaanite agricultural festival of spring which was a ceremony of unleavened bread connected with the barley harvest as the exodus motif grew the original function and symbolism of these double origins was lost 23 several motifs replicate the features associated with the mesopotamian akitu festival 24 other scholars john van seters j b segal and tamara prosic disagree with the merged two-festivals hypothesis 25 called the festival of the matzot hebrew hag hamatzot in the hebrew bible the commandment to keep passover is recorded in the book of leviticus in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk is the lord s passover and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the lord seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread in the first day ye shall have a holy convocation ye shall do no manner of servile work and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the lord seven days in the seventh day is a holy convocation ye shall do no manner of servile work the biblical regulations for the observance of the festival require that all leavening be disposed of before the beginning of the 15th of nisan 26 an unblemished lamb or goat known as the korban pesach or paschal lamb is to be set apart on nisan 10 27 and slaughtered at dusk as nisan 14 ends in preparation for the 15th of nisan when it will be eaten after being roasted 28 the literal meaning of the hebrew is between the two evenings 29 it is then to be eaten that night nisan 15 30 roasted without the removal of its internal organs 31 with unleavened bread known as matzo and bitter herbs known as maror 30 nothing of the sacrifice on which the sun rises by the morning of the 15th of nisan may be eaten but must be burned 32 the sacrifices may be performed only in a specific place prescribed by god for judaism jerusalem and for samaritans mount gerizim 33 the biblical regulations pertaining to the original passover at the time of the exodus only also include how the meal was to be eaten with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the lord s passover the biblical requirements of slaying the paschal lamb in the individual homes of the hebrews and smearing the blood of the lamb on their doorways were celebrated in egypt however once israel was in the wilderness and the tabernacle was in operation a change was made in those two original requirements passover lambs were to be sacrificed at the door of the tabernacle and no longer in the homes of the jews no longer therefore could blood be smeared on doorways the biblical commandments concerning the passover and the feast of unleavened bread stress the importance of remembering and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt and thou shalt observe and do these statutes commands in reference to god s sparing of the firstborn from the tenth plague and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever repeats the command to remember remember this day in which you came out of egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength the hand of the lord brought you out from this place in extra-biblical sources some of these details can be corroborated and to some extent amplified in extrabiblical sources the removal or sealing up of the leaven is referred to in the elephantine papyri an aramaic papyrus from 5th century bce elephantine in egypt 34 the slaughter of the lambs on the 14th is mentioned in the book of jubilees a jewish work of the ptolemaic period and by the herodian-era writers josephus and philo these sources also indicate that between the two evenings was taken to mean the afternoon 35 jubilees states the sacrifice was eaten that night 36 and together with josephus states that nothing of the sacrifice was allowed to remain until morning 37 philo states that the banquet included hymns and prayers 38 etymology part of a series on jews and judaism etymology who is a jew jewish peoplehood jewish identity religion god in

feminism jewish left category jews and judaism portal judaism v t the english term passover is first known to be recorded in the english language in william tyndale s translation of the bible later appearing in the king james version as well it is a literal translation of the hebrew term the hebrew is rendered as tiberian p sa and modern hebrew pesa pesah pesakh the yiddish word is latinized variously as peysekh paysakh paysokh the etymology is disputed and hypotheses are divided whether to connect it to psh to protect save or to a word meaning limp dance with limping motions cognate languages yield similar terms with distinct meanings such as make soft soothe placate akkadian passahu harvest commemoration blow egyptian or separate arabic fsh 39 the verb pas ch is first mentioned in the torah s account of the exodus from egypt and there is some debate about its exact meaning the commonly held assumption that it means he passed over in reference to god passing over or skipping the houses of the hebrews during the final of the ten plagues of egypt stems from the translation provided in the septuagint in and in targum onkelos translates pesach as he had pity coming from the hebrew root meaning to have pity 40 judging from other instances of the verb and instances of parallelism clarification needed a more faithful translation may be he hovered over guarding indeed this is the image invoked by the verb in isaiah 31 5 as birds hovering so will the lord of hosts protect jerusalem he will deliver it as he protecteth it he will rescue it as he passeth over - both meanings become apparent in exodus 12 23 when parsed as the lord will pass hover guard over the door and will not suffer the destroyer destroying angel is commanded to pass by the children of israel to come in unto your houses to smite the term pesach hebrew may also refer to the lamb or goat which was designated as the passover sacrifice called the korban pesach in hebrew four days before the exodus the hebrews were commanded to set aside a lamb and inspect it daily for blemishes during the day on the 14th of nisan they were to slaughter the animal and use its blood to mark their lintels and door posts up until midnight on the 15th of nisan they were to consume the lamb on the night of the first passover at the start of the original exodus each family or group of families gathered together to eat a meal that included the meat of the korban pesach while the tenth plague ravaged egypt passover offering korban pesach the main entity in passover according to judaism is the sacrificial lamb 41 during the existence of the tabernacle and later the temple in jerusalem the focus of the passover festival was the passover sacrifice hebrew korban pesach also known as the paschal lamb eaten during the passover seder on the 15th of nisan every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the jewish temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of nisan and eat it that night which was the 15th of nisan if the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting an offering was made for a group of families the sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened and had to be roasted without its head feet or inner organs being removed and eaten together with unleavened bread matzo and bitter herbs maror one had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering and none of the meat could be left over by morning because of the passover sacrifice s status as a sacred offering the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering among those who could not offer or eat the passover lamb were an apostate a servant an uncircumcised man a person in a state of ritual impurity except when a majority of jews are in such a state pesahim 66b and a non-jew the offering had to be made before a quorum of 30 pesahim 64b in the temple the levites sang hallel while the priests performed the sacrificial service men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering pesahim 91b women were obligated as men to perform the korban pesach and to participate in a seder today today in the absence of the temple when no sacrifices are offered or eaten the mitzvah of the korban pesach is memorialized in the seder korban pesach a set of scriptural and rabbinic passages dealing with the passover sacrifice customarily recited after the mincha afternoon prayer service on the 14th on nisan 42 and in the form of the zeroa a symbolic food placed on the passover seder plate but not eaten which is usually a roasted shankbone or a chicken wing or neck the eating of the afikoman substitutes for the eating of the korban pesach at the end of the seder meal mishnah pesachim 119a many sephardi jews have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the seder in memory of the korban pesach removing all chametz burning chametz on the morning before passover begins chametz leavening is made from one of five types of grains 43 combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes the consumption keeping and owning of chametz is forbidden during passover yeast and fermentation are not themselves forbidden as seen for example by wine which is required rather than merely permitted according to halakha the ownership of such chametz is also proscribed chametz does not include baking soda baking powder or like products although these are defined in english as leavening agents they leaven by chemical reaction not by biological fermentation thus bagels waffles and pancakes made with baking soda and matzo meal are considered permissible while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited the torah commandments regarding chametz are to remove all chametz from one s home including things made with chametz before the first day of passover it may be simply used up thrown out historically destroyed by burning or given or sold to non-jews or non-samaritans as the case may be to refrain from eating chametz or mixtures containing chametz during passover not to possess chametz in one s domain i e home office car etc during passover observant jews spend the weeks before passover in a flurry of thorough housecleaning to remove every morsel of chametz from every part of the home jewish law requires the elimination of olive-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one s possession but most housekeeping goes beyond this even the cracks of kitchen counters are thoroughly scrubbed for example to remove any traces of flour and yeast however small any item or implement that has handled chametz is generally put away and not used during passover 44 some hotels resorts and even cruise ships across america europe and israel also undergo a thorough housecleaning to make their premises kosher for pesach to cater to observant jews 45 interpretations for abstinence from leaven or yeast some scholars suggest that the command to abstain from leavened food or yeast suggests that sacrifices offered to god involve the offering of objects in their least altered state that would be nearest to the way in which they were initially made by god 41 46 according to other scholars the absence of leaven or yeast means that leaven or yeast symbolizes corruption and spoiling 41 47 additionally there is a tradition of not eating matzoh flat unleavened bread in the 30 days before passover begins so that there will be an increased appetite for it during passover itself sale of chametz chametz foods blocked from purchase during passover in a jerusalem supermarket chametz may be sold rather than discarded especially in the case of relatively valuable forms such as liquor distilled from wheat with the products being repurchased afterward in some cases they may never leave the house instead being formally sold while remaining in the original owner s possession in a locked cabinet until they can be repurchased after the holiday modern observance may also include sealing cabinets and drawers which contain chametz shut by using adhesive tape which serves a similar purpose to a lock but also shows evidence of tampering although the practice of selling chametz dates back many years some reform rabbinical authorities have come to regard it with disdain since the supposed new owner never takes actual possession of the goods 48 the sale of chametz may also be conducted communally via a rabbi who becomes the agent for all the community s jews through a halakhic procedure called a kinyan acquisition each householder must put aside all the chametz he is selling into a box or cupboard and the rabbi enters into a contract to sell all the chametz to a non-jew who is not obligated to celebrate the commandments in exchange for a small down payment e g 1.00 with the remainder due after passover this sale is considered completely binding according to halakha and at any time during the holiday the buyer may come to take or partake of his property the rabbi then re-purchases the goods for less than they were sold at the end of the holiday 49 search for leaven wikisource has original text related to this article talmud s introduction to checking for chametz and defining or literally light tractate pesachim 2a on the night of the fourteenth of nisan the night before the passover seder after nightfall on the evening before passover eve jews do a formal search in their homes known as bedikat chametz for any possible remaining leaven chametz the talmudic sages instructed that a search for chametz be made in every home place of work or any place where chametz may have been brought during the year 50 when the first seder is on a saturday night the search is conducted on the preceding thursday night thirteenth of nisan as chametz cannot be burned during shabbat the talmud in pesahim p 2a derives from the torah that the search for chametz be conducted by the light of a candle and therefore is done at night and although the final destruction of the chametz usually by burning it in a small bonfire is done on the next morning the blessing is made at night because the search is both in preparation for and part of the commandments to remove and destroy all chametz from one s possession 50 blessing for search of chametz and nullification of chametz before the search is begun there is a special blessing if several people or family members assist in the search then only one person usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present 50 blessed are you hashem our god king of the universe who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz in hebrew the search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents it is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by candlelight using a feather and a wooden spoon candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the chametz however most contemporary jewish-orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle because the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before passover there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for chametz will be in vain bracha l vatala if nothing is found thus 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some chametz will be found upon conclusion of the search with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place to be burned the next morning the following is said any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which i have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth original declaration as recited in aramaic 50 morning of 14th of nissan note that if the 14th of nissan is shabbat many of the below will be celebrated on the 13th instead due to restrictions in place during shabbat fast of the firstborn on the day preceding the first passover seder or on thursday morning preceding the seder when the first seder falls on motza ei shabbat firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the fast of the firstborn which commemorates the salvation of the hebrew firstborns according to god struck down all egyptian firstborns while the israelites were not affected however it is customary for synagogues to conduct a siyum ceremony marking the completion of a section of torah learning right after morning prayers and the celebratory meal that follows cancels the firstborn s obligation to fast burning and nullification of chametz on the morning of the 14th of nisan any leavened products that remain in the householder s possession along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night s search are burned s rayfat chametz the head of the household repeats the declaration of biyur chametz declaring any chametz that may not have been found to be null and void as the dust of the earth any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which i have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth original declaration as recited in aramaic 50 should more chametz actually be found in the house during the passover holiday it must be burnt as soon as possible unlike chametz which can be eaten any day of the year except during passover kosher for passover foods can be eaten year-round they need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends the historic paschal lamb passover sacrifice korban pesach has not been brought following the romans destruction of the second jewish temple approximately two thousand years ago and it is therefore still not part of the modern jewish holiday however the paschal lamb is still a principal feature of falashah karaite and samaritan observance in the times when the jewish temples stood the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in separate kosher for passover utensils and dishes due to the torah injunction not to eat chametz during passover observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes glassware and silverware and in some cases even separate dishwashers and sinks which have never come into contact with chametz for use only during passover under certain circumstances some chametz utensils can be immersed in boiling water hagalat keilim to purge them of any traces of chametz that may have accumulated during the year many sephardic families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for passover as the sephardic position is that glass does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem similarly ovens may be used for passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time or by applying a blow torch to the interior until the oven glows red hot a process called libun gamur 51 matzah machine made shmura matza a symbol of the passover holiday is matzo an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking so that it is not allowed to rise matzo may be made by machine or by hand the torah contains an instruction to eat matzo specifically on the first night of passover and to eat only unleavened bread in practice matzo during the entire week of passover 52 consequently the eating of matzo figures prominently in the passover seder there are several explanations for this the torah says that it is because the hebrews left egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise thus flat unleavened bread matzo is a reminder of the rapid departure of the exodus 53 other scholars teach that in the time of the exodus matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry making it similar to hardtack suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead matzo has also been called lechem oni hebrew bread of poverty there is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility appreciate freedom and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread 54 hand made shmura matzo shmura matzo watched or guarded matzo is the bread of preference for the passover seder in orthodox jewish communities shmura matzo is made from wheat that is guarded from contamination by chametz from the time of summer harvest 43 to its baking into matzos five to ten months later in the weeks before passover matzos are prepared for holiday consumption in many orthodox jewish communities men traditionally gather in groups chaburas to bake handmade matzo for use at the seder the dough being rolled by hand resulting in a large and round matzo chaburas also work together in machine-made matzo factories which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores the baking of matzo is labor-intensive 43 as only 18 22 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven consequently only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time and the chabura members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise a special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up 55 this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo after the matzos come out of the oven the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old potentially leavened dough remain as any stray pieces are now chametz and can contaminate the next batch of matzo some machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded 43 passover seder table set for the passover seder it is traditional for jewish families to gather on the first night of passover first two nights in orthodox and conservative communities outside israel for a special dinner called a seder derived from the hebrew word for order or arrangement referring to the very specific order of the ritual the table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal during this meal the story of the exodus from egypt is retold using a special text called the haggadah four cups of wine are consumed at various stages in the narrative the haggadah divides the night s procedure into 15 parts kadeish recital of kiddush blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine urchatz the washing of the hands without blessing karpas dipping of the karpas in salt water yachatz breaking the middle matzo the larger piece becomes the afikoman which is eaten later during the ritual of tzafun maggid retelling the passover story including the recital of the four questions and drinking of the second cup of wine rachtzah second washing of the hands with blessing motzi traditional blessing before eating bread products matzo blessing before eating matzo maror eating of the maror koreich eating of a sandwich made of matzo and maror shulchan oreich lit set table the serving of the holiday meal tzafun eating of the afikoman bareich blessing after the meal and drinking of the third cup of wine hallel recital of the hallel traditionally recited on festivals drinking of the fourth cup of wine nirtzah conclusion these 15 parts parallel the 15 steps in the temple in jerusalem on which the levites stood during temple services and which were memorialized in the 15 psalms 120 134 known as shir hama alot hebrew songs of ascent 56 the seder is replete with questions answers and unusual practices e g the recital of kiddush which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table the children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the exodus and its aftermath likewise they are encouraged to search for the afikoman the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder audience participation and interaction is the rule and many families seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing the seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the haggadah including chad gadya one little kid or one little goat maror types of maror grated horseradish romaine lettuce whole horseradish root maror bitter herbs symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in egypt the following verse from the torah underscores that symbolism and they embittered ve-yimareru their lives with hard labor with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field any labor that they made them do was with hard labor exodus 1 14 silver seder plate four cups of wine there is a rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal this applies to both men and women the mishnah says pes 10 1 that even the poorest man in israel has an obligation to drink each cup is connected to a different part of the seder the first cup is for kiddush the second cup is connected with the recounting of the exodus the drinking of the third cup concludes birkat hamazon and the fourth cup is associated with hallel the four questions and participation of children children have a very important role in the passover seder traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the passover seder beginning with the words mah nishtana haleila hazeh why is this night different from all other nights the questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal the questions asked by the child are why is this night different from all other nights on all other nights we eat either unleavened or leavened bread but tonight we eat only unleavened bread on all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables but tonight we eat only bitter herbs on all other nights we do not dip our food even once but tonight we dip twice on all other nights we eat either sitting or reclining but tonight we only recline often the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the haggadah which states the more one talks about the exodus from egypt the more praiseworthy he is many readings prayers and stories are used to recount the story of the exodus many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide afikoman 14th century haggadah the afikoman an integral part of the seder itself is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table during the fourth part of the seder called yachatz the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two he sets aside the larger portion as the afikoman many families use the afikoman as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the seder proceedings by hiding the afikoman and offering a prize for its return 43 alternatively the children are allowed to steal the afikoman and demand a reward for its return in either case the afikoman must be consumed during the twelfth part of the seder tzafun concluding songs after the hallel the fourth glass of wine is drunk and participants recite a prayer that ends in next year in jerusalem this is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon god s mercy and kindness and give thanks for the survival of the jewish people through a history of exile and hardship echad mi yodea who knows one is a playful song testing the general knowledge of the children and the adults some of these songs such as chad gadya are allegorical counting of the omer beginning on the second night of passover the 16th day of nisan 57 jews begin the practice of the counting of the omer a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of shavuot 50 days hence each night after the evening prayer service men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the omer on the first night for example they say today is the first day in or to the omer on the second night today is the second day in the omer the counting also involves weeks thus the seventh day is commemorated today is the seventh day which is one week in the omer the eighth day is marked today is the eighth day which is one week and one day in the omer etc 58 when the temple stood in jerusalem a sheaf of new-cut barley was presented before the altar on the second day of unleavened bread josephus writes on the second day of unleavened bread that is to say the sixteenth our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then and esteeming it right first to do homage to god to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way after parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding they bring to the altar an assaron for god and having flung a handful thereof on the altar they leave the rest for the use of the priests thereafter all are permitted publicly or individually to begin harvest 6 since the destruction of the temple this offering is brought in word rather than deed one explanation for the counting of the omer is that it shows the connection between passover and shavuot the physical freedom that the hebrews achieved at the exodus from egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the torah at mount sinai another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis torah and mitzvot before accepting god s law the distinction between the omer offering a measure of barley typically animal fodder and the shavuot offering two loaves of wheat bread human food symbolizes the transition process 59 chol hamoed the intermediate days of passover in israel passover lasts for seven days with the first and last days being major jewish holidays in orthodox and conservative communities no work is performed on those days with most of the rules relating to the observances of shabbat being applied outside israel in orthodox and conservative communities the holiday lasts for eight days with the first two days and last two days being major holidays in the intermediate days necessary work can be performed reform judaism observes passover over seven days with the first and last days being major holidays like the holiday of sukkot the intermediary days of passover are known as chol hamoed festival weekdays and are imbued with a semi-festive status it is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo hardboiled eggs fruits and vegetables and passover treats such as macaroons and homemade candies passover cake recipes call for potato starch or passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness cookie recipes use matzo farfel broken bits of matzo or ground nuts as the base for families with eastern european backgrounds borsht a soup made with beets is a passover tradition a passover brownie cake baked in a wonder pot while kosher for passover packaged goods are available in stores some families opt to cook everything from scratch during passover week in israel families that do not kasher their ovens can bake cakes casseroles and even meat 60 on the stovetop in a wonder pot an israeli invention consisting of three parts an aluminium pot shaped like a bundt pan a hooded cover perforated with venting holes and a thick round metal disc with a center hole which is placed between the wonder pot and the flame to disperse heat 61 seventh day of passover shvi i shel pesach seventh day of passover is another full jewish holiday with special prayer services and festive meals outside the land of israel in the jewish diaspora shvi i shel pesach is celebrated on both the seventh and eighth days of passover 62 this holiday commemorates the day the children of israel reached the red sea and witnessed both the miraculous splitting of the sea the drowning of all the egyptian chariots horses and soldiers that pursued them and the passage of the red sea according to the midrash only the pharaoh was spared to give testimony to the miracle that occurred hasidic rebbes traditionally hold a tish on the night of shvi i shel pesach and place a cup or bowl of water on the table before them they use this opportunity to speak about the splitting of the sea to their disciples and sing songs of praise to god citation needed second passover the second passover pesach sheni on the 14th of iyar in the hebrew calendar is mentioned in the hebrew bible numbers 9 6 13 as a make-up day for people who were unable to offer the pesach sacrifice at the appropriate time due to ritual impurity or distance from jerusalem just as on the first pesach night breaking bones from the second paschal offering numbers 9 12 or leaving meat over until morning numbers 9 12 is prohibited today pesach sheni on the 14th of iyar has the status of a very minor holiday so much so that many of the jewish people have never even heard of it and it essentially does not exist outside of orthodox and traditional conservative judaism there are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered jewish law the only change in the liturgy is that in some communities tachanun a penitential prayer omitted on holidays is not said there is a custom though not jewish law to eat just one piece of matzo on that night 63 traditional foods matzah brei fried matzo and egg a popular passover dish because the house is free of chametz for eight days the jewish household typically eats different foods during the week of passover some include ashkenazi foods matzah brei matzo softened in milk or water and fried with egg and fat served either savory or sweet matzo kugel a kugel made with matzo instead of noodles charoset a sweet mixture of fruit fresh dried or both nuts spices honey and

song the story of passover with its message that slaves can go free and that the future can be better than the present has inspired a number of religious sermons prayers and songs including spirituals what used to be called negro spirituals within the african-american community rabbi philip r alstat an early leader of conservative judaism known for his fiery rhetoric and powerful oratory skills wrote and spoke in 1939 about the power of the passover story during the rise of nazi persecution and terror 65 perhaps in our generation the counsel of our talmudic sages may seem superfluous for today the story of our enslavement in egypt is kept alive not only by ritualistic symbolism but even more so by tragic realism we are the contemporaries and witnesses of its daily re-enactment are not our hapless brethren in the german reich eating the bread of affliction are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood is not the ruthlessness of the egyptian pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the nazi dictators and yet even in this hour of disaster and degradation it is still helpful to visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of egypt it gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit only our estranged kinsmen the assimilated and the de-judaized go to pieces under the impact of the blow but those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair it is this faith born of racial experience and wisdom which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall be brought forth from bondage unto freedom from sorrow unto joy from mourning unto festivity from darkness unto great light and from servitude unto redemption influence on other religions christianity the two disciples peter and john were sent by christ to prepare the passover the christian feast of maundy thursday finds its roots in the jewish feast of passover the night on which the last supper is generally thought to have occurred 66 islam in the sunni sect of islam it is recommended to fast on the day of ashura 10th of muharram based on narrations attributed to muhammad the fast is celebrated in order to commemorate the day when moses and his followers were saved from pharaoh by god by creating a path in the red sea i e the exodus according to muslim tradition the jews of madinah used to fast on the tenth of muharram in observance of passover in narrations recorded in the
