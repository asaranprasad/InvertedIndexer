https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter diameter from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search circle with circumference c in black diameter d in cyan radius r in red and centre or origin o in magenta in geometry a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle it can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere in more modern usage the length of a diameter is also called the diameter in this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter which refers to the line itself because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length this being twice the radius r d 2 r r d 2 displaystyle d 2r quad rightarrow quad r frac d 2 for a convex shape in the plane the diameter is defined to be the largest distance that can be formed between two opposite parallel lines tangent to its boundary and the width is often defined to be the smallest such distance both quantities can be calculated efficiently using rotating calipers 1 for a curve of constant width such as the reuleaux triangle the width and diameter are the same because all such pairs of parallel tangent lines have the same distance for an ellipse the standard terminology is different a diameter of an ellipse is any chord passing through the center of the ellipse 2 for example conjugate diameters have the property that a tangent line to the ellipse at the endpoint of one of them is parallel to the other one the longest diameter is called the major axis the word diameter is derived from greek diametros diameter of a circle from dia across through and metron measure 3 it is often abbreviated dia dia d or contents 1 generalizations 2 diameter symbol 3 see also 4 notes generalizations edit the definitions given above are only valid for circles spheres and convex shapes however they are special cases of a more general definition that is valid for any kind of n-dimensional convex or non-convex object such as a hypercube or a set of scattered points the diameter of a subset of a metric space is the least upper bound of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the subset so if a is the subset the diameter is sup d x y x y a if the distance function d is viewed here as having codomain r the set of all real numbers this implies that the diameter of the empty set the case a equals negative infinity some authors prefer to treat the empty set as a special case assigning it a diameter equal to 0 4 which corresponds to taking the codomain of d to be the set of nonnegative reals for any solid object or set of scattered points in n-dimensional euclidean space the diameter of the object or set is the same as the diameter of its convex hull in medical parlance concerning a lesion or in geology concerning a rock the diameter of an object is the supremum of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the object in differential geometry the diameter is an important global riemannian invariant in plane geometry a diameter of a conic section is typically defined as any chord which passes through the conic s centre such diameters are not necessarily of uniform length except in the case of the circle which has eccentricity e 0 diameter symbol edit sign in a technical drawing sign from an autocad drawing the symbol or variable for diameter is similar in size and design to the latin small letter o with stroke in unicode it is defined as u 2300 diameter sign html 8960 on an apple macintosh the diameter symbol can be entered via the character palette this is opened by pressing opt cmdt in most applications where it can be found in the technical symbols category the character will sometimes not display correctly however since many fonts do not include it in many situations the letter the latin small letter o with stroke is an acceptable substitute which in unicode is u 00f8 html 248 oslash it can be obtained in unix-like operating systems using a compose key by pressing in sequence composedi citation needed and on a macintosh by pressing opt o the letter o not the number 0 in microsoft word the diameter symbol can be acquired by typing 2300 and then pressing alt x in latex the diameter symbol can be obtained with the command diameter from the wasysym package the diameter symbol is distinct from the empty set symbol from an italic uppercase phi and from the nordic vowel 5 see also slashed zero in german the diameter symbol german durchmesserzeichen is also used as an average symbol durchschnittszeichen see also edit look up diameter in wiktionary the free dictionary angular diameter caliper micrometer tools for measuring diameters conjugate diameters
